An all-day workshop held last week at the University of California, Santa Cruz, brought together representatives of the many governmental and nongovernmental agencies, private groups, and university researchers studying this remarkable landscape. </p><p>The ecological significance of the Santa Lucia Mountains was recognized most recently with the passage of the Big Sur Wilderness and Conservation Act of 2002, sponsored by Congressman Sam Farr and Senator Barbara Boxer. The act added 37,000 acres to the Ventana Wilderness in the heart of the range and nearly 20,000 acres to other nearby wilderness areas. </p><p>The goal of last week's workshop (held on January 31 at the Center for Ocean Health) was to develop a coordinated network among groups working in the Santa Lucia Mountains and encourage interdisciplinary biodiversity research and conservation. The participants worked to develop a set of research questions for a project, the Santa Lucia Gradient Study, that would meet the diverse needs of the network.</p><p>The workshop was organized by UCSC's STEPS Institute for Innovation in Environmental Research. </p><p>"The Santa Lucia Gradient Study is the kind of interdisciplinary effort in environmental research that STEPS was designed to help facilitate," said STEPS director John Thompson, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. </p><p>"We are developing a network that includes faculty throughout UCSC, colleagues at UC Berkeley and two UC Natural Reserves, and a wide range of others in public and private agencies and organizations who have been working hard for years on the complex issues of environmental research and policy in coastal California," Thompson said.</p><p>The focus of the Santa Lucia Gradient Study is rapidly changing biodiversity along steep coastal gradients. The Santa Lucia Range is just 12 miles wide and 55 miles long, yet nearly half of California's native plants can be found within it. The floras of northern and southern California mix in the Santa Lucia Range, making it the only place where, for example, redwoods and yuccas grow together. There are also at least 57 "endemic" plants that occur only in the Santa Lucia Mountains, including the rare Santa Lucia fir.</p><p>Accompanying this remarkable botanical diversity is a similarly rich assemblage of animal life. Threatened steelhead trout spawn in the streams and the reintroduced California condor soars overhead.</p><p>The workshop included 36 participants with a broad range of affiliations. Among them were Craig Moritz, director of UC Berkeley's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology; Jeff Kwasny, ecosystem manager for the Los Padres National Forest; Mary Dellavalle-Sanvictores, plant ecologist at Point Lobos State Park; Jeff Froke, president of the Santa Lucia Conservancy; Susanna Danner, conservation land manager for the Big Sur Land Trust; and the resident directors of the two UC Natural Reserves in the Santa Lucia Mountains, the Hastings Natural History Reservation (Mark Stromberg) and the Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve (John Smiley). Alex Glazer, director of the UC Natural Reserve System, also attended the workshop.</p><p>UC manages a system of 34 reserves throughout California for teaching and research. The Hastings reserve is located in the foothills on the inland side of the Santa Lucia Mountains, in the upper Carmel Valley. Its long history includes more than 50 years of research on vertebrate ecology and oak woodland biology. The Big Creek Reserve is located on the Big Sur coast and encompasses several miles of rugged ridges descending to a rocky shoreline. The reserve also extends offshore for about a mile as the Big Creek Marine Ecological Reserve.</p><p>In an effort to create links between terrestrial and marine research efforts, the STEPS workshop included researchers studying marine ecosystems along the central California coast. </p><p>"One of the most exciting aspects of this developing collaboration is the opportunity to establish better research and policy links across these neighboring terrestrial and marine environments," Thompson said.</p><p>The STEPS Institute was established in 2002 with a $500,000 gift from UCSC alumnus Gordon Ringold and his wife, Tanya Zarucki. The institute is working to link environmental research efforts campuswide, bringing together expertise from a wide range of departments in the physical and biological sciences, social sciences, and engineering. The institute seeks practical solutions to critical environmental problems and fosters communication and partnerships among researchers, policy makers, and resource managers.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Thompson at (831) 459-4741 or thompson@biology.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914c9ede8072704601a012ff80a43f1d"><name>289</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz offers resources to students displaced by off-campus fire</title><author>Jim Burns (831) 459-2495; jrburns@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Chavez House, fire</keywords><start-date>1044255600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz offers...</display-name><path>/2003/02/289</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/02/289</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337971887</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337971887</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz officials are encouraging students displaced by a fire in an off-campus co-op on Sunday to use university resources to secure replacement housing.

Since 1981, the Boise Peace Quilt Project has annually honored a variety of social activists including Pete Seeger, Caeser Chavez, Helen Caldicott, and Rosa Parks. Sorrels received her quilt--which took a year to make and was constructed by different people from around the world--on her birthday last year.</p><p> Sorrels has released 22 albums in a career that has spanned four decades, beginning with her first recording on the Folkways label in 1958. Her life is chronicled in the Nanci Griffith song "Ford Econoline," a popular tune about a single mother touring the country as a folk singer.</p><p> Last March, Sorrels retired from the road with a farewell concert in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that featured a multitude of musical guests including Jean Ritchie, Peggy Seeger, Loudon Wainwright III, Christine Lavin, and David Bromberg. WGBH in Boston recorded the show, and Red House Records may release a CD of the concert in the near future.</p><p>Sorrels decided to establish her archive at UCSC through a friendship with Rita Bottoms, head of Special Collections at McHenry Library. Bottoms had traveled to  Idaho with poet/artist Lawrence Ferlinghetti to attend his art show and reading. They met Sorrels, who lives in a cabin about 30 miles north of Boise, at an outdoor barbeque. Sorrels, it turned out, was a big fan of Ferlinghetti, as well as artist Kenneth Patchen, who both happen to have archives at UCSC's Special Collections.</p><p>"When Rosalie came out here on tour, she stopped by the library to see Kenneth Patchen's painted poems and we got to be friends," Bottoms recalled. "She has very much a sense of the importance of documenting history and social movements."</p><p>Sorrels's archive consists of photos, letters, mementos, newspaper clips, posters, flyers, and drawings, as well as all of her recordings from the past four decades. In her remarkable life, she encountered many of the celebrities of the Beat era and later the counterculture of the '60s. As a result, the archive includes a variety of correspondence from well-known artists, singers, political activists, and authors such as Pete Seeger, Hunter S. Thompson, William Kennedy, and Robert Creeley. </p><p>"It's stored in an enormous old ledger from 1867," noted Sorrels last week by telephone from Minneapolis, where she was appearing at a memorial for the late folksinger Dave Van Ronk. "It has all sorts of things; I saved a lot of newspaper clippings which are hard to come by--things like the Berkeley Barb's People's Park poster."</p><p>"It's a remarkable document of the last four decades," added Bottoms. "If you were a student or researcher, you could have a whole history of social activism."</p><p>Sorrels noted that she recently had acquired the rights to all 22 of her albums and plans to release some of them again on her brand-new label, Way Out In Idaho Productions. Her first release on the label will be a compilation titled Learned by Living, Sung By Heart. Although it is set to be released in March, Sorrels said that advance copies will be available at the UCSC show.</p><p>A master storyteller, Sorrels was once described by Hunter S. Thompson as "one king-hell songwriter." He went on to add, "Rosalie's songs are so close to the bone that I get nervous listening to them."</p><p>But Rolling Stone magazine may have put it best: "Rosalie Sorrels, who must know a million songs, can sing each one as if it's her life story."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ca1768072704601a012ffc7af9e76"><name>293</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Anthropologist pens an artful natural history of the Amazon</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Amazon River, Amazon, </keywords><start-date>1044255600000</start-date><display-name>Anthropologist pens an artful...</display-name><path>/2003/02/293</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/02/293</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337972551</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337972551</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>With his new book <i>In Amazonia: A Natural History,</i> anthropologist Hugh Raffles has set a new standard for the genre of natural history, artfully bringing to life the people, history, and science of this highly romanticized region. </p><p>	In engaging prose, Raffles traces the mystique of the Amazon back to 16th-century explorers and describes how it captivated Europeans' imagination as "a paradise full of riches" and simultaneously became the target of European anxiety about disease and the horror of unbridled nature. </p><p>	"Since the 1540s, people have described Amazonian nature as overwhelming and mysterious, yet it's also portrayed as a place of wealth and incredible natural resources," said Raffles, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and author of In Amazonia: A Natural History (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2002). </p><p>	In Amazonia has been hailed as a breakthrough natural history and celebrated for its "lively and witty prose." Central to Raffles's story is his contention that although the Amazon has long been considered a place of unparalleled wildness, the river's landscape has actually been dramatically transformed by hundreds of years of human intervention. </p><p>	"People talk about the Amazon as a natural landscape, but the people who live there have been transforming it forever," said Raffles. "It's much more appropriate to think of the Amazon as a managed landscape, as people are beginning to think about the American West." </p><p>	The Amazon continues to draw explorers of all sorts, and Raffles raises ethical questions for scientists and anthropologists. "For centuries, the Amazon has been a place of discovery. Even with bioprospecting today, the hope is that it holds the secrets of life," said Raffles.</p><p>	But In Amazonia was written for a broad audience, and Raffles writes for those who love to read, telling historical and contemporary stories about life on the river as he explores notions of place, nature, and science. He devotes one section of the book to the history of a small community established in 1958 by a landlord whose indentured laborers steadily remade the river to improve access to timber and other resources. Over the years, the residents cut through a waterfall at the mouth of the Amazon and established a network of water routes that runs three to four miles into the forest. </p><p>	The remote community, which Raffles calls Igarapé Guariba, is a "classic remote Amazonian village" that is home to about 150 people who live without running water, electricity, or sanitation. Located a four-hour boat trip from the nearest city, residents nevertheless make forays to the city two or three times a week. </p><p>	"They have dramatically changed the size of what was a narrow, shallow creek into a waterway that is now 800 meters across," said Raffles, who spent 15 months living in Igarapé Guariba. "They completely reengineered the landscape." Ultimately, opening up the land ushered in changes that helped residents displace the landlord in what Raffles calls a "mini revolution." </p><p>	Conservationists who portray the Amazon as a "natural landscape" may unwittingly jeopardize the lifestyles of the residents of hundreds of similar communities that are located along the Amazon's shores, said Raffles. "People on the river have changed it, and not just in the ways we've been hearing about since the 1970s," said Raffles, referring to the massive clear-cutting of rainforests. "There really isn't any left that's pristine."</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to Journalists: Hugh Raffles may be reached at (831) 459-3614 or via e-mail at raffles@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ca2928072704601a012ff769757ea"><name>294</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz dean honored by social psychologists</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Martin Chemers, personality and social psychology, Society for Personality and Social Psychology, (SPSP)</keywords><start-date>1044255600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz dean...</display-name><path>/2003/02/294</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/02/294</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337972838</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337972838</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Martin Chemers, a professor of psychology and dean of the Division of Social Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will be honored by the members of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology (SPSP) at their annual meeting on Feb. 6, 2003.</p><p>	Chemers is being recognized for his service to the 3,700-member organization, the largest organization of social and personality psychologists in the world.

The seamounts are separated by more than 30 miles (52 kilometers).</p>
<p>"One big underwater volcano is sucking in seawater, and the water flows north through the rocks of the seafloor and comes out through another seamount," said Andrew Fisher, an associate professor of Earth sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Scientists have known for decades that enormous quantities of ocean water circulate through the seafloor, flowing through the porous volcanic rock of the upper oceanic crust. In the process, the water extracts large amounts of heat from the crust, which is warmed by the constant flow of heat out of the Earth's interior. The mystery has been how the water gets in and out of the crust, most of which is covered by a thick layer of relatively impermeable sediments.</p>
<p>"The problem is that most of the seafloor doesn't have much exposed rock that would be permeable to water," Fisher said.</p>
<p>There is exposed rock on seamounts, underwater volcanoes that rise up through the sediment layer. The new discovery shows that water can travel long distances through the basaltic rock of the seafloor from one seamount to another. The findings have implications for understanding heat flow through the crust, the chemistry of ocean water, the microbial communities that live within the ocean floor, and the characteristics of subduction zones where oceanic crust dives beneath the continental plates.</p>
<p>Fisher and a team of collaborators from various institutions described their findings in a paper published in the February 6 issue of the journal Nature. Fisher's coauthors include Michael Hutnak and Abdellah Cherkaoui of UC Santa Cruz; Earl Davis and Robert Macdonald of the Geological Survey of Canada; Volkhard Spiess, Lars Z&#252;hlsdorff, and Heiner Villinger of the University of Bremen, Germany; Lizet Christiansen of Johns Hopkins University; K. Michelle Edwards and Keir Becker of the University of Miami; Michael Mottl of the University of Hawaii; and C. Geoff Wheat of the University of Alaska.</p>
<p>The researchers examined an area of the seafloor in the northeast Pacific, about 120 miles (200 kilometers) west of Vancouver Island. Further west is the Juan de Fuca Ridge, where two plates of the oceanic lithosphere are spreading apart. To the east, the Juan de Fuca Plate plunges beneath the edge of the North American Plate.</p>
<p>"We picked this spot on the ridge flank, between the spreading center and the subduction zone, because the sediment cover there is unusually thick and only a few seamounts are exposed. We knew from previous studies that warm water was coming out of one seamount, and we wanted to find where it was going in," Fisher said.</p>
<p>The researchers used a heat-flow probe to map out the temperature patterns within the seafloor. The results showed that cold water is flowing into the seafloor through a large seamount known as Grizzly Bare. The outflow point is a smaller seamount to the north called Baby Bare. Water samples collected from the seafloor between the two seamounts showed progressive changes in the chemistry of the water as it flows northward.</p>
<p>"The surprising thing was that the water goes in 52 kilometers from where it comes out. This shows that the circulation system is connected over very large distances," Fisher said.</p>
<p>The researchers used the change in water chemistry to calculate the rate of flow. Their best estimate is that it takes about 40 to 400 years for water to flow from one seamount to the other.</p>
<p>Now the challenge is to understand how the system works and what causes water to go in at one point and come out at another. Heat flow from inside the Earth appears to be the driving force, Fisher said. Warm water rising out of Baby Bare creates a suction effect that pulls cold water in at Grizzly Bare. A computer simulation showed that the temperature difference is enough to keep the flow going.</p>
<p>"It's a hydrothermal siphon, like siphoning water through a hose--once it gets going it can maintain itself. The question is, What gets it started?" Fisher said.</p>
<p>One possibility is that discharge is favored at smaller seamounts, where escaping water would lose less heat than it would if it were spread out over a larger area. The initial push could also come from an extreme event, such as an earthquake or a major storm, that causes a change in pressure over one area.</p>
<p>"The driving forces are small, so small perturbations may be enough to get it started," Fisher said.</p>
<p>Fisher and his collaborators have discovered similar systems on the floor of the Pacific near Costa Rica. Identifying discharge sites could be useful to scientists studying the microbial communities recently discovered living in the rocks of the oceanic crust, he said.</p>
<p>"These sites offer little windows into the subsurface, where we can sample the chemistry of the water and study any critters that get blown out along with it," Fisher said.</p>
<p>In addition, understanding the circulation of water through the oceanic crust may shed light on the behavior of subduction zones. When water gets squeezed out of a plate during subduction, it may lubricate the main fault and affect where earthquakes occur. Water that gets subducted deep into the mantle, on the other hand, may contribute to the explosive volcanism seen, for example, at Mount St. Helens and at Costa Rica's Arenal volcano.</p>

And when he returned to UCSC this month, an old alumni volunteer name badge was in his pocket.</p><p>Those loyalties will be put to good use in the next two years. Novack has been selected to serve as one of two alumni members of the University of California Board of Regents. The selection on February 1 by the Alumni Association Council, the governing board for the <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu">UC Santa Cruz Alumni Association</a>, capped an 18-month  process that attracted alumni candidates from around the nation. UC's alumni Regents are drawn from the various UC campuses on a rotating basis. </p><p>"I am proud that a UCSC graduate will be serving again as alumni Regent, and especially proud that we will be represented by Gary Novack," said UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "His scientific expertise and obvious commitment to UCSC and the university as a whole will make him a valuable asset to the Board of Regents."</p><p>Novack will be the third UCSC graduate to serve on the Board of Regents. His predecessors are Los Angeles Superior Court judge Allan Goodman (Stevenson '67), from 1979 to 1981; and San Francisco Bay Area attorney Paul Hall (Merrill '72), from 1991 to 1993.</p><p>During Novack's first year as an alumni Regent--from July 2003 to June 2004--he will attend all meetings and participate in policy discussions as a Regent-designate, without voting rights. During that year, Novack will also serve as treasurer of the Alumni Associations of the University of California. In the second year, Novack will become a voting Regent, and serve as vice president of the UC alumni organization. </p><p>Novack, founder and president of the pharmaceutical and drug consulting company Pharma.Logic Development, Inc., (<a href="http://www.pharmalogic.com/">www.pharmalogic.com</a>) has a long history of involvement with UC. A biology major at UCSC, he graduated in 1973 with honors, after just three years. He received his Ph.D. from UC Davis in 1977 in pharmacology and environmental toxicology, was an NIH postdoctoral trainee at UCLA from 1977 to 1979, and later taught at UC campuses in Santa Cruz, Davis, Irvine, and San Francisco. </p><p>Novack spent eight years on the UCSC Alumni Association Council and served as its president in 1993-94. He is a trustee for the UCSC Foundation and is a member of the Dean's Advisory Council for the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences at UCSC. He has lobbied the legislature as a volunteer advocate for UC and helped create a UCSC Alumni Association scholarship endowment that has granted awards to 110 financially needy students since its establishment in 1992. </p><p>Continuing a family tradition begun by his father, Novack is an Eagle Scout, and so is his son, Philip.</p><p>Speaking like the scientist he is, Novack joked that he may have a "genetic predisposition" for UC service. "My parents were Cal alumni," he explains. "I'm proud to continue the UC heritage." </p><p>"Gary Novack represents the best in academic, professional, and personal achievement by our alumni," said Alumni Association Council president Eric Thomas. "He brings a wealth of important perspectives to the UC Regent position as an undergraduate and graduate student, teacher, and successful businessman. He's given back to UCSC with years of active volunteer service. In addition, he has an easy confidence that quickly endears him to people. His skills and experience will serve him well in representing all UC alumni as a UC Regent."</p><p>Novack is a board-certified clinical pharmacologist. He has had a major role in the investigation of over 50 new drugs for the treatment of human illnesses, including macular degeneration, glaucoma, allergies, and cancer. He is a reviewer or is on the editorial board of several key ophthalmology journals, and has written more than 220 abstracts and publications in pharmacology, ophthalmology, neurology, dermatology, and medical communications. </p><p>Novack is on the boards of the nonprofit Foundation Fighting Blindness and of Inspire Pharmaceuticals, a public drug discovery and development company.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ca7b98072704601a012ff62600964"><name>298</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Lecture promises 'behind the headlines' look at Keiko the whale</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1044428400000</start-date><display-name>Lecture promises 'behind the...</display-name><path>/2003/02/298</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/02/298</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337974147</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337974147</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Keiko the killer whale has been making headlines since the early 1990s, when he starred in the popular Free Willy movies. For a look behind the headlines at the effort to return Keiko to the wild, the public is invited to a talk at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory by Charles Vinick, executive vice president of the Ocean Futures Society. Vinick directed the society's Keiko Project from 1999 to 2002 and is still involved as an adviser.</p><p>The lecture will take place at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center on Wednesday, February 19, from 7 to 8:30 p.m. Admission is $6 for the general public and $4 for members of the Friends of Long Marine Lab. This lecture is best suited for ages 9 and up.</p><p>The Ocean Futures Society was responsible for Keiko during the three and a half years he spent in Iceland, living in a sea pen in Klettsvik Bay and periodically venturing into the open ocean. Vinick accompanied Keiko aboard the U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo plane that took the famous whale from the Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport, Oregon, to Iceland in 1998, two and a half years after he had been moved to Oregon from a Mexico City amusement park. </p><p>Vinick spent every summer in Iceland and made regular visits during the rest of the year. Summers were a time of peak activity, when Keiko spent increasing amounts of time in the open ocean, interacting with wild orcas. Vinick will discuss his experiences working with Keiko, the scientific work his organization has been able to accomplish, and the challenges of working on a project that has been the subject of such intense public interest and media attention. </p><p>"The media tends to need a controversy to make a good story, and a lot of times the controversy has overshadowed what Keiko himself has achieved," Vinick said.</p><p>In the summer of 2002, Keiko left Iceland on his own, traveling eastward across the North Atlantic for 30 days until he reached the coast of Norway. Management of the Keiko Project is now overseen by the Free Willy/Keiko Foundation and the Humane Society of the United States, with the Ocean Futures Society serving an advisory role. </p><p>"Keiko has demonstrated that he has the capacity to travel over 1,000 miles in the open ocean and to sustain himself without being fed by humans," Vinick said. "When he arrived in Norway, the public and media attention was overwhelming. Children swam with him and people fed him. Media attention focused on his interest in people more than on what he had accomplished in his travel to Norway. That truly misses the point. Keiko has proven time and again that he is remarkably resilient and self-sufficient, and he tends to push the envelope beyond what people think he can do."</p><p>Nevertheless, Vinick said there are a number of challenges facing Keiko in the weeks and months ahead. Later this month, wild orcas are expected to arrive in Taknes Bay, Norway, where Keiko has been since December. Last summer, Keiko spent most of his time in the open ocean interacting with wild Icelandic orcas. No one knows whether that will happen with the new whales he will encounter in Norway, Vinick said.</p><p>More information about Keiko is available on the web site of the Ocean Futures Society at <a href="http://www.oceanfutures.org">http://www.oceanfutures.org</a>.</p><p>For reservations and information about Vinick's lecture and other events at the Seymour Center, call (831) 459-3800 or visit the center's web site at <a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu">seymourcenter.ucsc.edu</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ca90f8072704601a012ffd6359054"><name>299</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC literature professor links Santa Cruz to international theater event for peace</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1045033200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC literature professor links...</display-name><path>/2003/02/299</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/02/299</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337974488</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337974488</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>On March 3, Santa Cruz will join hundreds of cities around the world in hosting a staged reading of Aristophanes' ancient Greek antiwar comedy Lysistrata. The local play reading is part of the international Lysistrata Project, the first-ever worldwide theater event for peace. As of mid-February, 380 readings have been scheduled in 31 countries to protest against a possible war with Iraq.</p>
<p>The Santa Cruz reading will take place on Monday, March 3, at 7 p.m. at the Louden Nelson Center, 301 Center Street, in downtown Santa Cruz. The local event is being organized by UC Santa Cruz assistant professor of literature Jody Greene. Admission is free.</p>
<p>"I heard about it on NPR and I decided I wanted to do it here," Greene explained. "They're doing it in Iceland, Tel Aviv, Athens, Juneau, Alaska--they're doing it all over the world. They're even having simultaneous readings on the web."</p>
<p>The ancient Greek play tells the story of women from opposing states who come together to end a war by refusing to sleep with their husbands. Desperate for intimacy, the men eventually agree to lay down their swords and achieve peace through diplomacy.</p>
<p>The cast of 22 at the Santa Cruz reading will include six UCSC faculty including Deanna Shemek, associate professor of Italian &amp; Comparative literature; Rob Wilson, professor of literature; Jennifer Gonzalez, assistant professor of art history; Farnaz Fatemi, lecture in writing; Carla Freccero, professor of literature; and K. Silem Mohammed, visiting assistant professor of literature. It will also feature graduate students and undergraduates from Greene's UCSC class "Reading the Traditional Canon," as well as a local high school student in the title role.</p>
<p>"We are putting on the play not to advocate a sex strike, but to suggest that we need to get more creative in response to the threat of going to war," Greene said. "Really, it's a call for creativity. Because marching through the streets with placards is not working. It's a playful way to get people thinking of how to communicate their vision of a better future."</p>
<p>"It's also about using alliances--really unlikely alliances--and getting together groups that don't usually align together to protest, such as isolationists and people on the left," Greene added. "That's absolutely crucial."</p>
<p>The Lysistrata Project was founded by New York actors Kathryn Blume and Sharron Bower, who originally e-mailed their friends and put up a web site to voice opposition to a war in Iraq. The response was enormous and soon evolved into an international grassroots peace movement, uniting theater artists throughout the world.</p>
<p>In addition to readings in cities such as London, Paris, Beirut, Berlin, and Jerusalem, groups from nearly every state in the U.S. are planning events in this groundbreaking, worldwide theatrical act of dissent. In New York City alone, dozens of teams of actors and directors will stage readings in public spaces throughout the day, culminating in an evening reading by an all-star cast. Greene noted that San Francisco also has six different readings scheduled to take place throughout the city.</p>
<p>At the Santa Cruz reading, the audience will be given the opportunity to donate funds to benefit the School for Peace in the small Israeli village of Neve Shalom/Wahat Al Salam.

Like most marine fish, rockfish produce larval young that spend the first few months of their lives drifting about in the ocean currents. For years, scientists have had little knowledge of the processes and patterns involved in the dispersal of rockfish larvae and their eventual return as juveniles to their nearshore habitat. </p><p><table BGCOLOR="#FFCC33" align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="3" valign="TOP" width="50%"><tr><td><b><font color="#333333">EMBARGOED: Not for release until 12 noon Mountain Time (2 p.m. Eastern Time) on Saturday, February 15, 2003. A news briefing will be held at that time at the AAAS Meeting in Denver at the Colorado Convention Center.</font></b></td></tr></table>Now, researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, are working out the details of the oceanographic conditions that determine how and when juvenile rockfish return to the kelp beds. New instruments that provide detailed information about distinct layers and movements of ocean waters along the coast are playing a key role in this effort. </p><p>"Only now do we have the technology to see the fine-scale thermal and density structure of the ocean and make these connections between specific oceanographic events and the biology of fish and other organisms," said Margaret McManus, an assistant professor of ocean sciences at UCSC.</p><p>UCSC graduate student Arnold Ammann found that juvenile rockfish return to their nearshore habitats in pulses, the timing of which depends on the species. Linking these patterns with oceanographic observations, McManus and her collaborators found that some species are brought in with the periodic upwelling of cold, deep water, while others come in when the upwelling subsides. In addition, McManus has found that fish larvae and other plankton are often concentrated in previously undetected thin layers of ocean water that extend for miles and persist for days at a time. </p><p>"We have found concentrations of organisms in these layers five times higher than in surrounding waters," McManus said.</p><p>McManus will present the group's findings in a symposium, "Opening the Black Box: Understanding Ecosystem Dynamics in Coastal Oceans," at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Denver.</p><p>McManus and postdoctoral researcher Curt Storlazzi collaborated with Ammann, currently a research fisheries biologist at the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) laboratory in Santa Cruz, and UCSC marine ecologists Mark Carr and Peter Raimondi. Their ongoing research is part of the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO), a multi-institutional collaboration funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. Carr and Raimondi are the lead investigators for PISCO at UCSC.</p><p>Scientists are keen to understand how rockfish populations are replenished, because the populations of many West Coast species have declined dramatically in recent years, Carr said.</p><p>"The delivery of the young fish back into the kelp beds is what replenishes rockfish populations," he said. "One of the key questions for marine ecologists and fisheries biologists is to understand what determines year-to-year variation, as well as geographic variation, in the replenishment of these fish populations."</p><p>Surveys conducted by Carr in the late 1990s found striking year-to-year variations in the numbers of juveniles "recruited" into different rockfish populations. Rockfish species responded differently to the changes in oceanographic conditions associated with the 1998 El Niño and the subsequent La Niña in 1999. The species fell into two groups: one whose juveniles showed up in the kelp beds in large numbers during El Niño but did poorly during La Niña, and another group that had the opposite response, recruiting poorly during El Niño and doing well during La Niña.</p><p>"Those patterns suggested that oceanographic conditions influence rockfish species differently and determine the year-to-year variation in recruitment," Carr said.</p><p>To follow up on those findings, the researchers designed a coordinated study in which McManus and Storlazzi obtained oceanographic data with an array of new instruments while Ammann collected detailed data on recruitment of juvenile rockfish into nearshore populations. Ammann set out SMURFs (Standard Monitoring Units for Recruitment of Fishes)--mesh tubes filled with a plastic material that mimics the juveniles' preferred habitat--at sites in Monterey Bay. Every two to three days, Ammann would collect fish from the SMURFs and identify and count them. Meanwhile, the group monitored currents, temperatures, and a range of other conditions in the bay.</p><p>The results showed that juvenile rockfish show up in pulses during the year that correspond to different phases in the periodic upwelling of deep water along the coast. Upwelling occurs during the spring and summer when winds from the northwest blow warm surface waters offshore and stir up deep, cold water nearshore. Every couple of weeks or so, the winds shift and the upwelling subsides, allowing warm water to move back to the coastline--this is known as relaxation.</p><p>It turns out that the rockfish species that recruited large numbers of juveniles into the kelp beds during El Niño also showed high recruitment during relaxation events. The species that recruited well during La Niña, meanwhile, showed high recruitment during upwelling events. This makes sense because during an El Niño upwelling is suppressed by an influx of warm tropical water along the California coast. Conversely, during La Niña the upwelling of cold water is especially intense. </p><p>"We've found there are two groups of rockfish, one that depends on warm water events and another that depends on cold water events for the recruitment of juveniles," Ammann said. </p><p>Surveys by NMFS biologists have shed some light on the offshore phase of the rockfish life cycle. When they are released, rockfish larvae are very small and their ability to swim is limited, so they are at the mercy of the currents. As they grow and are better able to swim, the species that recruit during upwelling move down into deeper water, whereas the species that recruit during relaxation events stay near the surface. </p><p>"The ones that recruit during upwelling basically make a big vertical loop during that phase of their life cycle," Carr said.</p><p>Another difference between the two groups is that the larvae of those recruited during upwelling tend to spend more time in the dispersal phase than those that recruit during relaxation events (several months versus several weeks). The species that recruit during upwelling events include black rockfish, blue rockfish, olive rockfish, and yellowtail rockfish. The species that recruit during relaxation events include gopher rockfish, kelp rockfish, and black and yellow rockfish.</p><p>Another link between physical oceanography and the distribution of young rockfish that the PISCO researchers are exploring is the concentration of some fish larvae in thin layers. McManus and collaborators Percy Donaghay of the University of Rhode Island, Van Holliday of BAE Systems in San Diego, and others have been investigating the phenomenon of thin layers in coastal waters for more than eight years using new instruments the team has developed. </p><p>Thin layers are coherent patches of plankton that range in thickness from about 4 inches to 10 feet, much thinner than could be detected by traditional sampling methods using towed nets and bottles. Monterey Bay shows the strongest layering of any site the researchers have studied, McManus said.</p><p>The layering occurs during upwelling conditions, when the water in the bay flows in a large, counterclockwise gyre and becomes stratified into layers. When the upwelling subsides, the layers break down and the organisms that had been concentrated in a thin layer become mixed throughout the water column. McManus believes that the larvae and juveniles of the rockfish species that recruit during relaxation events are associated with the thin layers. </p><p>"We think that the fish larvae are in the thin layers, because that's where all the food is, and during relaxation events they get mixed out, and that's when recruitment occurs," McManus said.</p><p>Two key instruments used in the thin layer studies are an acoustic profiler and an optical profiler, both of which McManus helped develop. The combination of these instruments provides a detailed profile of the water column, from near the ocean bottom to the surface, showing not only physical conditions such as temperature and salinity, but also how much phytoplankton (algae and other plant life) and zooplankton (including fish larvae and other small animals) occur at every depth. The new instruments are accurate to within a few inches, provide continuous monitoring, and use radio transmitters to send data streaming back to researchers' offices onshore. </p><p>"I can sit in my office and see what the conditions are out in the bay at any time," McManus said.</p><p>To find out what was in the layers, PISCO divers collected samples from a location where the instruments showed a distinct layer. Initially skeptical, the divers reported that as they descended they suddenly encountered a six-foot-thick layer with drastically reduced visibility. The water samples they brought back from the layer showed three- to five-times higher concentrations of a wide range of organisms compared to the water above and below the layer. There were many types of zooplankton, including fish larvae, as well as phytoplankton, bacteria, and viruses. </p><p>The fish species in these preliminary samples were not identified, but intensive sampling of the layers, including identification of fish larvae, is planned for later this year, McManus said.</p><p>"We really want to know why these organisms are concentrated in the layers and how they are interacting," she said.</p><p>The presence of thin layers in Monterey Bay with such high concentrations of various organisms has implications beyond the replenishment of rockfish populations, McManus said. For example, monitoring for harmful algal blooms currently relies on samples collected at the surface or with nets towed behind a boat. But if toxin-producing algae are concentrated in a thin layer, they could go undetected.</p><p>Fisheries scientists, meanwhile, are especially interested in the influence of major oceanographic events such as El Niño and La Niña on the replenishment of rockfish populations. For at least some species, strong recruitment during extreme events may play a key role in maintaining populations, Carr said.</p><p>"During the last La Niña, we saw a surprisingly large recruitment of bocaccio, which is one of the more threatened species of rockfish, and we hadn't seen much recruitment of bocaccio for a couple of decades before that. So these episodic events can be very important," he said.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact McManus at margaret@es.ucsc.edu.</p><p>Images can be downloaded from the web at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/">http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/download/</a>. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914cab808072704601a012ff4255ea31"><name>301</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz and CNET investigation results in arrest of four students</title><author>Elizabeth Irwin (831) 459-2495</author><start-date>1045551600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz and...</display-name><path>/2003/02/301</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/02/301</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337975104</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337975104</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Elizabeth Irwin</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>emirwin@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Following a four-month joint investigation by UC Santa Cruz Police Department and members of the Santa Cruz County Narcotics Enforcement Team (CNET), police officers served search and arrest warrants this morning (Tuesday, February 18) at Porter College. Four UCSC students were arrested and booked into Santa Cruz County jail.</p>
<p>Officers seized psilocybin mushrooms, LSD, mescaline, hashish oil, marijuana, and drug paraphernalia in quantities consistent with a sales operation, police said.</p>
<p>All of the arrested students are freshmen living at Porter College. The names of those arrested and charges against them are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trenton Rembert, 18, three counts of narcotic sales<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Dennis Guiney, 19, one count of narcotic sales<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Julian Nicholas Wong, 19, one count of narcotic sales; one count of conspiracy to commit narcotic sales<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Grant Goodrich, 18, one count of possession of narcotics for sale</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>In accordance with UCSC's alcohol and drug policy, individuals found responsible for the sale or transfer of illegal drugs may be suspended or dismissed from the university, in addition to any criminal prosecution. Accordingly, the campus's Student Judicial Affairs Office has initiated its own investigation into the matter, and the university's housing contracts with these students are being terminated.</p>

We want to invest not just in getting students here but in making sure they get through," said project director Margarita Azmitia, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><p>	Azmitia, a developmental psychologist who specializes in educational transitions, is conducting the nine-month study of about 200 first-year students. The results will help shape university policies and programs aimed at retention and academic success. </p><p>Participating students fill out a questionnaire and are interviewed individually each quarter in an effort to assess whether and how students draw on their family, friends, and the university for emotional support and academic help during their first year of college. Although the participants are all enrolled at UCSC, the results are intended for use throughout the UC system. Students receive $15 for each interview session. The study began last fall; results will be published as a policy brief due October 1.</p><p>A total of 140 students come from groups that are typically underrepresented at the University of California (African American, Latino/Chicano, Filipino, Native American, and low-income white students who are the first in their family to go to college). The remaining 60 students are middle-class whites who are not the first in their family to attend college and Asian Americans of Japanese or Chinese descent. </p><p>Researchers are also considering the role of academics, student background, and mental health in the first-year college experience. Familial expectations and values about college-going are measured, as well as how students draw upon their friends from home and their friends from college. Individual factors such as the students' ethnicity, gender, and academic history are also weighed. </p><p>	"We try to look at everything--their self-esteem and feelings of competence, how engaged they are with the university, how their classes are going, whether they have made friends and are participating in extracurricular activities, and if they're having roommate problems," said Azmitia.</p><p>	By meeting with students three times during the academic year, researchers are able to assess the ups and downs of the first-year college experience, said Azmitia. Typically, first-year college students report high levels of satisfaction in the fall, more challenges during the winter, and a sense of accomplishment in the spring.</p><p>So far, Azmitia reports that only about 15 percent of participating students are struggling academically and that homesickness is a bigger problem than many expected to encounter. "They're really missing their families," said Azmitia. "A lot of them want cell phones so they can call home more often."</p><p>At the policy level, Azmitia says the preliminary data suggest that perhaps the university needs to bolster outreach to students during winter months. "Students receive a big welcome when they arrive in the fall, and some students plug into that right away," she said. "But if students are shy or were too busy with their classes, by winter quarter some are struggling to find ways to connect and get involved. The majority are doing fine, but the more vulnerable students are floundering."</p><p>Azmitia and the research team decided to diverge slightly from the standard scientific practice that requires that researchers provide no information to their participants for the duration of the study. Instead, they provide information about university services and supports to students in need because they want to help the students adjust and decide to stay in college. </p><p>"College is like life, you get out of it what you put into it. But these are 17- and 18-year-olds," said Azmitia. "They don't know how to access all the resources around them yet. That's part of what they're learning in college."</p><p>Curious to see what happens over the long haul, Azmitia hopes to secure outside grant support to follow this group of students throughout their college years. For now, though, she is immersed in the details of dorm life, classes, grades, and social activities.</p><p> "How the transition to the first year of college goes influences the students' pathway through college," she said. "It's important for the university to know as much as possible about that first year."</p><p>Azmitia received $50,000 in funding from the UC All Campus Consortium On Research for Diversity (UC/ACCORD), which harnesses the research expertise of the university to identify strategies that will increase college preparation, access, and retention. She also received $10,000 from UCSC's Academic Senate Committee on Research, and $6,000 from the Social Sciences Division.</p><p>Working with Azmitia are postdoctoral and doctoral students Holli Tonyan, Olaf Reis, Kim Radmacher, Joel Gills, and Kate McLean, who helped design and implement the study, as well as 15 undergraduate researchers.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914cae218072704601a012fff6f59671"><name>305</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>$1 million gift from philanthropist Jack Baskin to UC Santa Cruz School of Engineering supports new building and new department</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1045724400000</start-date><display-name>$1 million gift from...</display-name><path>/2003/02/305</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/02/305</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337975793</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337975793</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Retired engineer and philanthropist Jack Baskin has once again demonstrated his strong support for the engineering school that bears his name with a gift of $1 million to the Baskin School of Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Baskin's latest contribution will help fund a new engineering building now under construction on the UCSC campus and will create an endowed chair in the newly forming Department of Biomolecular Engineering. </p><p>"Jack Baskin once again has shown his amazing commitment to the School of Engineering and the UCSC campus with his generosity and foresight. Because his gift is so closely aligned with our long-range plans and vision, it creates an enormous impact that is most timely," said Steve Kang, dean of the School of Engineering. </p><p>The Department of Biomolecular Engineering will feature an interdisciplinary blend of engineering, biology, and chemistry. David Deamer, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, is currently serving as acting chair and is overseeing the formation of the new department.  </p><p>The endowed chair, established with part of the Baskin gift, will be held by the chair of the department. A national search will be conducted to hire a permanent chair. </p><p>"The endowed chair will be a tremendous help to us in attracting excellent candidates for the position of founding chair of this exciting new department," Kang said.</p><p>Research in biomolecular engineering at UCSC focuses on several key areas: bioinformatics, which uses computational techniques to sift through volumes of data generated by the human genome project and other new developments in biomedical research; systems biology, which uses advanced technology to investigate large-scale biological systems such as gene regulation and cellular pathways; proteomics (a new approach for studying the full complement of proteins in a cell) and protein engineering; and technology development, including work on new laboratory devices and analytical tools for studying genes, detecting biohazards, and conducting environmental surveys.</p><p>The other portion of the Baskin gift will go toward the construction of the Engineering 2 Building, which will provide more than 90,000 square feet of new office, laboratory, and classroom space for the engineering school. Construction of the new building, adjacent to the existing Baskin Engineering Building, began in summer 2002 and is scheduled for completion in fall 2004. The building is expected to cost over $61 million.</p><p>Part of the Engineering 2 Building will house UCSC programs affiliated with two of the newly established California Institutes for Science and Innovation--the Institute for Quantitative Biomedical Research (QB3) and the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS). The Santa Cruz components of these two institutes are closely related to programs in the School of Engineering and involve engineering school faculty.</p><p>The QB3 Institute, headquartered at UC San Francisco with major research components at UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz, promises to lead a revolution in biomedical research. The institute aims to integrate physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences to create new techniques for attacking major problems in biology and medicine. UCSC's contribution focuses on bioinformatics.</p><p>CITRIS is based at UC Berkeley, with major components at UC Davis, UC Merced, and UC Santa Cruz. CITRIS researchers plan to design information technology solutions to large-scale social problems affecting the quality of life of individuals and the effectiveness of organizations.

Brought to the floor by Assistant Professor Paul Ortiz of UCSC's Community Studies Department and amended by faculty members, the resolution opposed U.S. action against Iraq on numerous grounds, including the belief that:<br/>
<br/>

<ul>
<li>No link has been made between the September 11 terrorist attacks and the government of Iraq.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>A war with Iraq would "aggravate tensions" in the Middle East.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Diplomatic efforts and weapons inspections in Iraq should continue.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>A war with Iraq would result in the death of numerous U.S. soldiers and Iraqi civilians.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>A war would divert money from education to warfare and interfere with the university's international initiatives and programs.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>The resolution urged the U.S. government to "work with the United Nations to obtain compliance by Iraq with United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning disarmament by Iraq of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and to fully support the work of the international weapons inspectors in Iraq."</p>
<p>In all, the senate is comprised of 637 members. Ortiz said that he had obtained written support for his draft resolution from 112 members in advance of the meeting.</p>

Girls are, in fact, engaged in a far more complex process of identity formation that guides their choices and shapes their futures, said Bettie, who points to historical and structural forces that shape the lives of contemporary girls, including the growth of low-wage, service-sector jobs, changes in family structure, and changing laws on affirmative action and bilingual education.</p><p>	But Bettie is equally critical of scholarly studies that focus on race or class to the exclusion of gender. Women Without Class (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2003) has been called "a challenge to feminists who can see only gender and theorists of class and race who cannot see gender at all." </p><p>	In researching the book, Bettie spent a year interviewing and hanging out with more than 60 white and Mexican American girls from working- and middle-class families during their senior year at a school she calls "Waretown High" to protect the identities of her research subjects. Bettie talked with girls about school, family, work, fashion, dating, friendships, popular culture, college, and their futures. Her book reveals that class differences are part of our everyday interactions but are rarely talked about overtly. Class differences are key to middle-class practices of exclusion that make school success difficult for working-class students across race and ethnicity, she asserts.</p><p>	Bettie's research shows that school cliques (including "cholas," "hicks," "preps," and "skaters") and the styles they display at times reflected race and class differences among students. Bettie documents the categories of subculture and style that high school students use to express class and racial/ethnic differences among themselves, and she focuses on how girls form their identities in opposition to one another as different kinds of girls. Bettie argues that differences in clothing, makeup, and hairstyle have meaning beyond gender. </p><p>	"Young people have a sense of inequality, but they rarely express it in political terms," she said. "Instead, class struggle is waged over modes of identity expression where style can be used to express group membership."</p><p>Contemporary girls' "performances of identity" are complex, she added.</p><p>	"Adults often fail to see that the practices that disturb them, like sexual display, piercings, and tattoos, often mark class and race relations among girls and are not solely expressions of gender inequality," said Bettie. These "emblems of race and class membership" too often are misunderstood and interpreted as moral differences in sexual practices between supposed "good girls" and "bad girls," she added.</p><p>	In particular, Bettie recognizes that girls, not just boys, are "class actors" who will hold jobs and have an economic impact. "The fact that girls are future workers gets overlooked when school officials interpret girls' choices about clothing and makeup as solely about an interest in boys and sex, when it can be as much about their identity as members of the working class or of a racial/ethnic group," she said.</p><p>	Bettie's research reveals the consequence of schools' treatment of "girls without class." For instance, schools too often envision low-income boys as on route to becoming "workers" but tend to see girls--especially working-class and/or Mexican American girls--as on route to various kinds of "family" lives. </p><p>	On the contrary, even during high school, working-class girls, like boys, were working and bringing home money to assist their family, Bettie found. "Girls, too, are class actors with identities and futures in relation to work and income," said Bettie.</p><p>	Social policy, too, reduces poor women to a family-based identity, asserted Bettie. "You see it when low-income women--especially welfare mothers--are not understood as poor due to low wages but because they are considered to be in between men," said Bettie. "That view makes their economic dependence on men seem natural or inevitable and sidelines the real causes of women's poverty."</p><p>	Girls today want and expect to be economically independent from men, which is often possible for middle-class girls and women, noted Bettie. "But the fact is that living-wage working-class jobs are still not available for working-class women and are, in fact, increasingly scarce for young working-class men." </p><p>	"The problems that working-class girls face are not unique to their age or part of a crisis among youth," said Bettie. "Their problems are the same problems that plague adult working-class women--occupational segregation, low wages, lack of affordable child care, higher education, housing, and health care."</p><p>	Bettie's research also underscores the salience of race and ethnicity on academic achievement. She found that middle-class students of color were more likely to be represented in working-class and "downwardly mobile" peer groups than were middle-class white students. "At a moment when policy makers are debating affirmative action and the relative importance of race and income on educational achievement, my research shows that class is a key variable for understanding academic achievement but that race and ethnicity remain equally salient," said Bettie.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to journalists: Julie Bettie may be reached at (831) 459-3717 or via e-mail at jbettie@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914cb2fb8072704601a012ff9afff20d"><name>309</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Utopia scholar to deliver annual UCSC faculty research lecture</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1045724400000</start-date><display-name>Utopia scholar to deliver...</display-name><path>/2003/02/309</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/02/309</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337977033</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337977033</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UCSC professor of history Jonathan Beecher will deliver the 36th annual Faculty Research Lecture on Tuesday, March 11, at 8 p.m. in the Second Stage Theater on campus. The event is free and open to the public. </p><p>	Beecher was selected by UCSC faculty members for the prestigious honor given in recognition of outstanding research achievements at the university. One of the world's leading intellectual historians, Beecher will speak on the topic: "Two Concepts of Utopia."</p><p>	"Utopian speculation has been a vehicle--not only for imagining better worlds, but also for criticizing the world we live in."  Beecher noted. "There's something in the utopian enterprise that we desperately need."</p><p>	Beecher said that utopias have had a bad name since the collapse of the Soviet Union. He added that many critics of utopias misunderstood what the great writers in the utopian tradition have been saying.</p><p>	"It's been said by many critics that 'someone who believes in utopia today is widely considered out to lunch, or out to kill,'"  Beecher explained. "I think that modern utopian thinking has been gravely compromised by the ideologically motivated wars of the 20th century, by the totalitarian regimes that claimed to be inspired by utopian ideas."</p><p>	Beecher described his upcoming lecture as a trip into the past, beginning with Thomas More, who invented the genre of utopia in 1516, and ending with Ernst Bloch, the late 20th-century author of The Principle of Hope. Along the way, Beecher will cover the Russian anti-utopian writers Fyodor Dostoevsky and Yevgeny Zamyatin, as well as Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, the work of 18th-century French thinker Denis Diderot, the late 19th-century Victorian utopian William Morris, and the 19th-century early French utopian socialist Charles Fourier. </p><p>	"It's a broad topic that allows me to talk about a lot of writers that interest me,"  Beecher noted. "I think it should be broadly accessible."</p><p>	Although he said his first reaction to being selected as the annual speaker by the Academic Senate was one of amazement, Beecher speculated on why he thought he was chosen.</p><p>	"The history that I write is readable,"  he observed. " I write on weird and obscure topics, but I try to write for a wide audience."</p><p>	Beecher published his first book, The Utopian Vision of Charles Fourier, shortly after his arrival at Santa Cruz in 1970. In 1986, he finished Charles Fourier: The Visionary and his World, a monumental study grounded in years of archival research, that has now been translated into both French and Japanese. In 2001, he published a second major biography, Victor Considerant and the Rise and Fall of French Romantic Socialism.</p><p>	An inspiring lecturer in French, European, and Russian intellectual history, Beecher received the UCSC Alumni Association's Distinguished Teaching Award in 1988. He is currently at work on a study of the history and tradition of anti-utopian writing, as well as a volume about Herman Melville. </p><p>Beecher's excitement and enthusiasm for new research is contagious.</p><p>	"I'm an archive rat,"  he confessed. "I recently learned of a great archival collection in Russia. It's in the old central party archive of the Communist party--letters, manuscripts, and documents of early French utopian ideas--all created at the beginning of the Soviet Union." </p><p>	"I read about its existence in the French newspaper Le Monde," Beecher added. "It's the history of European socialism buried in an archive. All of it had been inaccessible to Western scholars until after the fall of the Soviet Union.

He shares the award with his former graduate student, Linda R. Tropp, now an assistant professor of psychology at Boston College.</p><p>	The recipients of the 2002-03 Gordon Allport Award were announced by the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues (SPSSI), a nonprofit organization of psychologists and social scientists that supports research on the psychological aspects of social issues. Pettigrew and Tropp received the prize for their paper, "A Meta-analytic Test and Reformulation of Intergroup Contact Theory," which shows the role intergroup contact plays in reducing prejudice. The annual award, which recognizes the "best paper or article on intergroup relations," carries a $1,000 cash prize. Pettigrew also received the Gordon Allport Award in 1988.</p><p>	Pettigrew, a research professor of social psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is a pathbreaking social psychologist who is widely credited with demonstrating that racism is largely a matter of conformity to social norms and as such can be changed. He has studied intergroup relations for four decades. Last fall, he received a lifetime achievement award from the Society for Experimental Social Psychology. </p><p>	Pettigrew has studied black-white racism in the United States, and he has studied intergroup relations in South Africa, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany. He studied with Gordon Allport, a founder and past president of SPSSI, at Harvard University, where Pettigrew earned his Ph.D. He taught at the University of North Carolina and Harvard before coming to UCSC in 1979. Pettigrew retired from teaching in 1994 yet remains an active researcher and was recently appointed a senior fellow at Stanford University's Research Institute for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity. </p><p>	Tropp earned her Ph.D. in psychology from UC Santa Cruz in 2000.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a27f36878072704601a012ff5841dbba"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2003/02/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/02/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626500173</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626500173</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a27f36878072704601a012ff5841dbba"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2003/02/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/02/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626500173</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626500173</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
