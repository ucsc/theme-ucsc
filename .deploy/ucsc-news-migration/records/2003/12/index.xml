The Film Scholars Program was created in 1999 "to stimulate and support the creation of new, innovative and significant works of film scholarship about cultural, educational, historical, theoretical, or scientific aspects of theatrical motion pictures."</p><p>"I was stunned when I heard the news; I never imagined I would win," said Stamp. "But I'm so grateful that the Academy is recognizing research on early women filmmakers. What a thrill it will be to 'thank the Academy' at the awards luncheon."</p><p>Stamp was selected to receive this year's award along with Thomas Doherty, chair of the Film Studies Program at Brandeis University. They are the fourth pair of film scholars to be honored by the Grants Committee of the Academy Foundation, whose members include cinematographers, directors, producers, actors, and writers. Stamp is also the youngest scholar and second woman ever granted such an award.</p><p>"Only established scholars, writers, historians and researchers with a significant record of achievement were considered for the grants," noted Grants Committee Chair Janet MacLachlan.</p><p>The two Academy Film Scholars will receive the first half of their grants at a December 11 luncheon hosted by the Academy at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los Angeles. Following the completion of their manuscripts, they will present their projects at a public Academy event.</p><p>Stamp's project focuses on Lois Weber, a female director of the silent-film era who became the first and only woman granted membership in the Motion Picture Directors Association, a precursor to the Directors Guild of America. Despite achieving widespread fame during the early 1900s, Weber has been mostly neglected by film historians. </p><p>"Her reputation has not survived as well as those of other prominent silent film directors such as D. W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille," Stamp noted. "But in the 1910s, Weber would have been included along with them in any mention of the industry's top directors. Until very recently, her filmmaking legacy was largely lost."</p><p> Stamp said that Weber's career spotlights the importance of activist filmmaking in the early years of the American film industry.</p><p>"Weber was a director/screenwriter who made films about social problems in the 1910s," Stamp explained. "She took on all of the hot button issues of the decade, including contraception, capital punishment, drug abuse, religious intolerance, and labor issues. Her career flourished during a period when the industry was open to activist filmmakers. By the '20s, that era was largely gone, as the industry shifted more towards glamour, entertainment, and escapism."</p><p>Stamp added that during the 1910s and early '20s, women held a degree of influence in Hollywood that remains unmatched even today. </p><p>"Weber was extremely well known and well respected in her lifetime," Stamp said. "For a time, she was the highest paid director in Hollywood, and she was a celebrity of sorts, profiled in movie fan magazines, women's magazines, and national newspapers. By looking at her career and work, I can trace the cultural history of early Hollywood and women's important place there."</p><p>Stamp said she would use her grant to cover travel expenses for conducting research at film archives, as well as to help her take time off to write the book. She has already traveled to the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., the UCLA Film and Television Archive, the National Film Archives in London, the Nederlands Filmmuseum in Amsterdam, and the Academy's own archive in Los Angeles in order to examine original scripts, promotional materials, industry trade publications, and rare archival film prints. Ultimately, Stamp's book, "Lois Weber in Early Hollywood," will be published by University of California Press.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d4e958072704601a012ff27293fb2"><name>432</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sociologist John Kitsuse, internment camp survivor, dies at 80</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1070521200000</start-date><display-name>Sociologist John Kitsuse, internment...</display-name><path>/2003/12/432</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/12/432</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338016866</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338016866</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>John I. Kitsuse, a second-generation Japanese American who was imprisoned in an internment camp during World War II and became a leading scholar in the field of sociology, died Thursday, November 27, at his home in Santa Cruz after suffering a stroke the day before. He was 80 years old.</p><p>	Kitsuse, a professor emeritus of sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, was one of the premier theorists in the field of social problems and deviant behavior. He had a wide range of academic interests, including education, sexuality, and crime, but was primarily known for developing the theory of social construction, which explored how social problems come to be understood as social problems.</p><p>	As a young Fulbright scholar, Kitsuse traveled to Japan 40 years ago, establishing professional affiliations that shaped much of his early work, said his friend and colleague Hiroshi Fukurai, associate professor of sociology at UCSC. </p><p>While in Japan, Kitsuse studied a method of prisoner rehabilitation called naikan that requires inmates to reflect on the shame their actions had brought to family members and loved ones, and introduced the method to American scholars. "That concept was very alien in the United States," said Fukurai. </p><p>	Kitsuse later addressed a major social problem that confronted Japan in the 1980s as a byproduct of that country's "economic miracle." After being raised overseas, many children of Japanese business executives returned to Japan and struggled to readjust to a culture they'd never known, said Fukurai. </p><p>	"John Kitsuse was, without a doubt, the most famous American sociologist in Japan, especially in the field of criminology, deviance, and social problems," said Fukurai, noting that Kitsuse's signature text, Constructing Social Problems, coauthored by Malcolm Spector, was translated into Japanese.</p><p>Kitsuse, who joined the UCSC faculty in 1974 and retired in 1991, served as president of the Society for the Study of Social Problems from 1978 to 1979. He was vice chair of the UCSC Academic Senate from 1979 to 1980 and was chair of sociology from 1985 to 1988 and for two quarters in 1980.</p><p>	Kitsuse earned his bachelor's degree from Boston University and his master's and Ph.D. from UCLA. Before arriving at Santa Cruz, Kitsuse was affiliated with the University of Washington, San Diego State University, and Northwestern University.</p><p>	Kitsuse is survived by his wife, Katherine Kitsuse; his son Edward; his daughter Alicia; and two grandsons, Nolan and Christopher. </p><p>	A memorial service is planned for the spring. The family requests that donations in Kitsuse's memory be directed to the UCSC Sociology Department. Donations can be sent to: UC Santa Cruz Foundation--Kitsuse Memorial, Attn: John Leopold, Social Sciences I, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, CA 95064. </p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d4fd68072704601a012ff2b5fddda"><name>433</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Studies show global warming is likely to drive big changes in California's coastal waters through effects on upwelling</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1071644400000</start-date><display-name>Studies show global warming...</display-name><path>/2003/12/433</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/12/433</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338017185</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338017185</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Global warming could have profound effects on the wind-driven upwelling of deep ocean water along the California coast, according to recent studies by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The studies showed changes in both the intensity and the seasonal timing of the upwelling, which brings cold, nutrient-rich water into coastal ecosystems.</p><p>This seasonal upwelling supports California's diverse marine life and productive fisheries, but how changes in the upwelling will affect these and other aspects of coastal ecosystems remains uncertain. The researchers, led by professor of Earth sciences Lisa Sloan, used computer simulations of the regional climate to show that wind-driven upwelling along the California coast will likely intensify over the next 50 years as a result of increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In addition, the models showed the upwelling season extending later into the fall.</p><p>The first set of experiments was published in the August 14 issue of Geophysical Research Letters (GRL), and a second paper with additional findings will be published online this week by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).</p><p>Previous studies by other researchers found that the intensity of upwelling along the California coast has been increasing over the past 30 years, leading some to speculate that the trend is a result of global warming, said Mark Snyder, lead author of the GRL paper. Snyder earned his Ph.D. this month working with Sloan. </p><p>"Some people think we may already be seeing the effects of climate change on the upwelling regime, so we thought we would use our climate models to see how increases in greenhouse gases would affect the winds that drive the upwelling," he said.</p><p>These winds are the result of differences in atmospheric pressure over the land and the ocean that develop because the land surface heats up faster than the ocean surface. Similarly, global warming could be expected to raise temperatures more over land than over the ocean, making the differences in atmospheric pressure even greater and creating stronger winds. Sloan's group set out to test this hypothesis using powerful computers to run complex models of the climate system.</p><p>The researchers used a high-resolution regional climate model, centered over California and driven by inputs from a global climate model with coarser resolution, to look at the effects of rising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Concentrations of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere, are increasing due to emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.</p><p>The first set of experiments, published in the GRL paper, showed that with increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the intensity of upwelling is decreased in the early season (April to May) and is dramatically increased during the peak season (typically July to August). The results also showed the duration of the upwelling season extends further into the fall. </p><p>"The increase we saw in the upwelling intensity in the peak season supports some of the observational work showing a trend toward increased upwelling intensity in the present day," Snyder said.</p><p>The new results just published by PNAS reinforce these findings. In these experiments, the researchers included the effects on the climate system of changes in vegetation that are likely to occur with increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. The results showed the same general effects on upwelling as in the previous studies, only more pronounced, said postdoctoral researcher Noah Diffenbaugh, lead author of the PNAS paper.</p><p>"The interactions between vegetation and climate that are set in motion by increasing carbon dioxide concentrations enhance the effects on the upwelling regime," Diffenbaugh said. </p><p>The projected changes in vegetation result from warmer and dryer conditions created by global warming and lead to changes in the overall energy balance of the land surface, he said.</p><p>Diffenbaugh cautioned, however, that despite the complexity of the climate models, they still represent a simplified view of an extraordinarily complicated system of feedbacks and interactions. Nevertheless, as human activities continue to pour more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, these studies show just how wide-ranging its effects may be. </p><p>"The regional climate model is certainly the best tool we have at the moment, and it shows us that elevated carbon dioxide is important not only for its direct effects on the climate, but also because it induces other changes that feed back into the climate system, and the magnitudes of those feedbacks appear to be substantial," Diffenbaugh said.</p><p>Researchers at UCSC and elsewhere are currently working to understand how changes in upwelling conditions will affect fisheries and the dynamics of coastal ecosystems. The new climate studies highlight the importance of those efforts, Snyder said.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Sloan at (831) 459-3693 or lcsloan@es.ucsc.edu; Snyder at msnyder@es.ucsc.edu; and Diffenbaugh at ndiffenbaugh@es.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d51378072704601a012ffa7e8d2c4"><name>434</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation awards $17.5 million for Thirty-Meter Telescope plans</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1071644400000</start-date><display-name>Gordon and Betty Moore...</display-name><path>/2003/12/434</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/12/434</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338017514</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338017514</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation awarded $17.5 million to the University of California for collaboration with the California Institute of Technology on a project intended to build the world's most powerful telescope. Coupled with an award by the Foundation to Caltech for the same amount, a total of $35 million is now available for the two institutions to collaborate on this visionary project to build the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). Their next step will be to work together to formulate detailed design plans for the telescope.</p><p>A 30-meter-diameter optical and infrared telescope, complete with adaptive optics, would result in images more than 12 times sharper than those of the Hubble Space Telescope. The TMT will have nine times the light-gathering ability of one of the 10-meter Keck Telescopes, which are currently the largest in the world. With such a telescope, astrophysicists will be able to study the earliest galaxies and the details of their formation as well as pinpoint the processes that lead to young planetary systems around nearby stars.</p><p>"We are very pleased that the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation has recognized the strengths of the University of California and Caltech to carry out such an important project," said UC President Robert C. Dynes. "The giant telescope will help our astronomy faculty stay at the very forefront of that dynamic field of science."</p><p>"The University of California and Caltech will work in close and constant collaboration to achieve the goals of the design effort," said Joseph Miller, director of UC Observatories/Lick Observatory, headquartered at UC Santa Cruz. "We've also entered into collaborations with the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy and the Association of Canadian Universities for Research in Astronomy, both of whom are in the process of seeking major funding."</p><p>According to Richard Ellis, director of Caltech Optical Observatories and Steele Professor of Astronomy at Caltech, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation's award will provide the crucial funding needed to address the major areas of risk in this large project. </p><p>"This next phase is of central importance, because in the course of carrying it out, we will establish the fundamental technologies and methods necessary for the building of the telescope," Ellis said.</p><p>Miller and Ellis agree that the TMT is a natural project for UC and Caltech to undertake jointly, given their decades of experience as collaborators in constructing, operating, and conducting science with the world's largest telescopes at the Keck Observatory. The TMT design is a natural evolution of the Keck Telescope design, and many of the same UC and Caltech scientists involved in the creation of the Keck Observatory are deeply involved in the TMT project.</p><p>Following the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation-funded design study, the final phase of the project, not yet funded, will be construction of the observatory at an as yet undetermined site.

The class takes place at the Louise Cain Gatehouse on the UC Santa Cruz Farm.</p>
<p>UCSC garden managers Christof Bernau and Albie Miles will discuss general fruit tree care throughout the year, then demonstrate proper pruning techniques. "We'll talk about the benefits and goals of pruning, and how both winter and summer pruning can enhance fruit tree health, fruit quality, and vigor," said Bernau. Unpruned or poorly pruned trees tend to get into a cycle of "alternate bearing," with good production one year and a poor crop the next, said Bernau. "This syndrome can be easily corrected with proper pruning," he added.</p>
<p>A similar workshop on pruning stone fruit trees--plums, peaches, and apricots--is scheduled for January 31.</p>
<p>Cost of each workshop is $10 for Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden, and $15 for the general public, payable the day of the class. No preregistration is necessary. Participants are encouraged to wear warm clothes; heavy rain cancels the event.</p>
<p>For more information or details about access, call (831) 459-3240 or send e-mail to jonitann@ucsc.edu. The workshops are cosponsored by the Friends of the UC Santa Cruz Farm &amp; Garden, and the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems.</p>
<p>The UCSC Farm is located 1/4 mile up the gravel road above the Blacksmith Shop. Free public parking is available in the Physical Plant parking lot, across the street from the Blacksmith Shop. After entering campus, turn right at the first stoplight and park in the Physical Plant parking lot. A map is available at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/casfs">www.ucsc.edu/casfs</a>.</p>
