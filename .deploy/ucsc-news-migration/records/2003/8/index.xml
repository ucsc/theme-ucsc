Crossing boundaries and merging genres is the order of the day as UCSC's innovative performing arts presenter offers up a brand new lineup of 23 original performances by some of the world's most inventive artists.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of music as well as cross-disciplinary works in the season," observed Arts &amp; Lectures director Michelle Witt. "It's fascinating to present a wide variety of top folk, jazz, world, classical, and early music, and see where the genres intersect."</p>
<p>Along with performances by ten-time Grammy winner and vocalist extraordinaire Bobby McFerrin, revolutionary performance artist Laurie Anderson, and acclaimed classical guitarist Sharon Isbin, UCSC Arts &amp; Lectures will also present comedy, theater, and dance from such groundbreaking performers as Chicago's legendary touring comedy troupe Second City, the hilariously eccentric monologist Spalding Gray, and San Francisco's boundary-smashing Joe Goode Performance Group.</p>
<p>Virtuoso country and bluegrass fiddler Mark O'Connor will bring his new band, the Hot Swing Trio, for an evening of jazz inspired by the 1930s union of violinist Stephane Grappelli and guitarist Django Reinhardt. "They just performed at the San Francisco Jazz Festival and they're getting great reviews all over the country," Witt noted.</p>
<p>The Ghazal Ensemble will also showcase an intricate blend of two distinctive types of classical music for a passionate evening of Indo-Persian fusion. "These performers are superstars in the field of Indian and Persian music," said Witt. "And they've intertwined the classic traditions to create something entirely new."</p>
<p>Cutting-edge artist Maya Beiser, formerly known as the cellist for the Bang on a Can All-Stars, will additionally present a brand-new multimedia solo concert featuring the premiere of a Steve Reich multitrack cello piece, plus other new works--employing text, vocals, dramatic lighting, as well as interactive video created by Irit Batsry, winner of the Whitney Museum's prestigious Bucksbaum Award.</p>
<p>And in a fascinating career reinvention, Dan Zanes, former lead singer and songwriter for the Boston rock band The Del Fuegos, will bring his new band that specializes in performing award-winning music for kids. As the Nashville Scene put it: "This rock veteran reinvents children's music, and parents everywhere are thankful."</p>
<p>This is the second season programmed by Witt, a classical violinist who came to UCSC in 2001 after spending five years as director of performing arts at Sun Valley Center for the Arts in Idaho. She holds a graduate degree in music from UCLA and spent several years at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, where she taught violin. An experienced performer, "mostly chamber music and with orchestras," Witt will display her own musical talent this fall in the UCSC Music Department's faculty recital series with pianist Mary Jane Cope.</p>
<p>It's no surprise then, that she's excited about booking artists such as The Artis Quartet in their first-ever appearance at UCSC. "They're a young string quartet out of Vienna that is absolutely wonderful," Witt enthused. "They have an unbelievably beautiful sound and are some of the most intelligent interpreters of the standard repertoire that I've ever heard."</p>
<p>Witt described her criteria for selecting artists to create a new season.</p>
<p>"The most important thing I look for is excellence--there are so many artists out there that I try to find the truly exceptional ones that are doing work a cut above in whatever genre," she said. "I also look at originality--what is their vision? Are they creating something new? And how well are they able to engage and draw in the audience, because performances really are opportunities for interaction."</p>
<p>Witt added that she strongly considers the needs of both the UCSC and Santa Cruz communities.</p>
<p>"Some communities won't support work that is politically and artistically challenging, and some organizations are afraid of alienating audiences," Witt said.</p>
<p>"But at UCSC, I have found the institution and the audiences are really receptive to material that asks difficult questions. There's a sense of curiosity, openness, and knowledge here that our artists greatly appreciate. The artists always tell us how wonderful our audiences are here--they feel appreciated and want to come back. "That's a huge compliment to audiences in Santa Cruz and ensures that we can continue to bring unique and important voices to our community," she added.</p>

Images from the Hubble Space Telescope, confirmed by detailed observations at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, show a dwarf satellite galaxy in the process of being torn apart by gravitational forces due to the larger spiral galaxy and its halo of dark matter. </p><p>"Although long predicted, direct evidence for plumes of stars being ripped from a dwarf galaxy as it is swallowed up by a giant galaxy has remained elusive. This discovery provides the best evidence to date," said Duncan Forbes, an astronomer at Swinburne University of Technology in Australia.</p><p>Forbes is first author of a report on the discovery published online by Science Express on August 7. The paper will appear in print in a later issue of the journal Science. Forbes's coauthors include Jean Brodie, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, whose team examined the two galaxies during an observing run at the powerful Keck I Telescope in March.</p><p>"In the Hubble images you can see a small blob close to the spiral galaxy that seems to have two plumes coming from it, so you could speculate that they are connected. But to prove it we had to show that they are in fact in the same location in space and not just superimposed," Brodie said.</p><p>Spectroscopic analysis of the light from the two galaxies showed that they are in fact physically associated, lying at a distance of about 2 billion light-years from Earth. Because the dwarf galaxy is so faint, this type of analysis could only be achieved with a large telescope like the Keck, Brodie said.</p><p>The two interacting galaxies are among thousands of faint galaxies seen in the background of one of the first images obtained with the new Advanced Camera for Surveys installed on the Hubble Space Telescope last year. Dominating the image is the dramatic "Tadpole" galaxy, but it was the backdrop of more distant galaxies that most excited astronomers. </p><p>Michael Beasley, a postdoctoral researcher working with Forbes at Swinburne, first noted the uncataloged spiral galaxy and its apparent satellite. Beasley, Brodie, and Brodie's graduate student Jay Strader were at the Keck I Telescope as part of an ongoing study of globular clusters in distant galaxies when they decided to take a closer look at this intriguing pair of objects. </p><p>Plumes of stars can be seen streaming away from the center of the dwarf galaxy. The gravitational pull of the larger spiral galaxy and its associated dark matter creates tidal forces that disrupt the smaller galaxy and strip stars away from it. These stars eventually become part of the spherical halo of stars around the flattened disk of the spiral galaxy. </p><p>With the observational data in hand, the researchers turned to Kenji Bekki of the University of New South Wales, who performed computer simulations to see how the interaction of the two galaxies would evolve over time. The simulations suggest that the disruption process is transforming the satellite from one type of dwarf galaxy into another, Forbes said. </p><p>"Our observations combined with our simulations lend support to the idea of tidal disruption transforming dwarf galaxies," he said.</p><p>The new findings support the prevailing theory of a hierarchical universe in which galaxies were formed within halos of dark matter, and massive galaxies have grown by gobbling up smaller galaxies. Astronomers have observed many cases of galaxy interactions involving two large galaxies, but the evidence for giant galaxies absorbing less massive ones has been largely circumstantial. For example, streams of stars in our own Milky Way and in the nearby Andromeda galaxy have been identified as relics of past mergers. </p><p>"We assume that mergers with minor galaxies are a very important part of how massive galaxies build up their halos, but this is the first time we've been able to see directly that it's happening, without making any assumptions," Brodie said.</p><p>Simulations of dwarf satellites suggest why astronomers have not previously witnessed such a clear example of ongoing disruption. Most dwarf galaxies have highly elongated orbits that take them far away from their host galaxies most of the time. In addition, the plumes or tails of stars being stripped away from them are usually very faint and extremely hard to detect.</p><p>"You can only see this type of interaction when the satellite galaxy is very close to the more massive host galaxy, but dwarf galaxies spend most of their time very far away," Brodie said.</p><p>#####</p><p>Images of the galaxies and a movie of the computer simulation are available at the following web site: http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/galaxy/dwarf.html</p><p>Reporters may contact Forbes at dforbes@swin.edu.au; 61-3-9214-4392 or 61-0404-171-540.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d0e5a8072704601a012ffc6668958"><name>385</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Leaders in science education gather at UCSC this week for a five-day conference on informal learning</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Children's Discovery Museum in San Jose, Center for Informal Learning and Schools, King's College London, Exploratorium in San Francisco, Doris Ash, Barbara Rogoff</keywords><start-date>1060671600000</start-date><display-name>Leaders in science education..</display-name><path>/2003/08/385</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/08/385</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338000401</created-on><last-modified-by>tasilva</last-modified-by><last-modified>1284498820564</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Leaders in science education will gather at the University of California, Santa Cruz, this week to explore the connections between the informal science learning that takes place in settings such as museums and the more formal learning that takes place in schools.</p>
<p>The five-day conference brings together participants in the Center for Informal Learning and Schools (CILS), an international collaboration between UC Santa Cruz, the Exploratorium in San Francisco, and King's College London. Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), CILS aims to invigorate science education in schools by studying how children learn in informal settings and by strengthening the relationships between museums and schools.</p>
<p>Bruce Alberts, director of the National Academy of Sciences, and Judith Ramalay, assistant director for education and human resources at NSF, will be among the speakers at the conference, which begins Friday, August 15. Called the Bay Area Institute, the conference will include discussion sessions, research presentations, and field trips to local informal science institutions where CILS faculty have been doing research.</p>
<p>Doris Ash, an assistant professor of education at UCSC, has been investigating informal science learning by videotaping and interviewing visitors (after obtaining their consent) at UCSC's Seymour Marine Discovery Center and the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Ash described one memorable interaction between a mother and daughter visiting the Seymour Center that illustrates the value such informal settings can have for science education.</p>
<p>"They were at an exhibit on elephant seals and were talking about how elephant seals dive and their adaptations, and the daughter was very excited; there was a lot of conversation. Then the mother said something like, 'This is really interesting science.' And the daughter said, 'I hate science!'" Ash recalled. "She'd been doing wonderful science, but she didn't recognize it because it wasn't like the formal lessons in school."</p>
<p>One of the goals of CILS is to find ways to transfer to the classroom some of the excitement that informal settings can generate. While there has been a great deal of research on classroom learning, relatively few studies have been done on informal learning, said Barbara Rogoff, a professor of psychology at UCSC.</p>
<p>"Informal learning is very widespread--it occurs in museums, in the way we learn our first language, in the way many people learn to use a computer, in many after-school settings, and even in some schools. But there hasn't been much research on it. People have assumed that informal learning takes place much the same way learning occurs in the classroom, but there are important differences," Rogoff said.</p>
<p>Common features of informal learning include active involvement by the learner and collaboration between people with different levels of expertise, both of which seem to play an important role in motivating people in informal settings, Rogoff said. Her research in immigrant communities where most people haven't had much formal schooling suggests that informal learning styles may hold valuable lessons for educators.</p>
<p>"Their ways of learning are very effective, which is often surprising to people who have spent a lot of time in school," Rogoff said. "That is an important resource for helping schools to work more effectively."</p>
<p>Studies of informal science learning can also suggest ways to improve institutions such as museums to make them more appealing to diverse populations. Ash, for example, is studying bilingual families and how they make sense of the science they encounter in exhibits. Maureen Callanan, a professor of psychology, is collaborating with Ash, and has also looked at gender differences in informal settings.</p>
<p>In a study done at the Children's Discovery Museum in San Jose, Callanan found that parents tend to spend more time explaining science to boys than to girls. Her findings prompted museum staff to develop a new exhibit, called "Alice's Wonderland," that presented science and math content in a scene that would be interesting to girls. At that exhibit, parents explained as much to girls as to boys.</p>
<p>"We worked very closely with the museum on that exhibit. They would design prototypes and then we would study how families interacted with them and provide feedback to the designers," Callanan said.</p>
<p>The Bay Area Institute is the first major conference for CILS. Researchers, educators, and museum professionals, as well as graduate students and postdoctoral fellows affiliated with CILS, will be among the participants. CILS offers doctoral programs that examine learning theory and practice from formal and informal perspectives, a professional development program for museum-based teacher educators exploring strategies for supporting formal education systems, and postdoctoral research appointments.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d0f958072704601a012ffb503c63b"><name>386</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>'Wind to Whales' research program to investigate the Monterey Bay ecosystem receives additional funding of $2 million</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>NOAA, Center for Integrated Marine Technologies, CIMT, Wind to Whales, Gary Griggs, Institute of Marine Sciences at UCSC</keywords><start-date>1060844400000</start-date><display-name>'Wind to Whales' research...</display-name><path>/2003/08/386</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/08/386</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338000739</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1528302941484</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has awarded a grant of nearly $2 million to the University of California, Santa Cruz, to support the ongoing development of the Center for Integrated Marine Technologies (CIMT). The center, established last year with an initial $2 million grant from NOAA, has brought together a diverse group of scientists from six partner institutions around Monterey Bay to study the processes that drive California's highly productive coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>A complex web of physical and biological interactions sustains these ecosystems, from the wind that drives the upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water to the great whales drawn to bountiful feeding grounds. The "Wind to Whales" research program refers to the whole network of dynamic interactions that CIMT scientists are working to monitor and understand, focusing for now on the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Ultimately, the researchers would like to be able to predict how the system will respond to changes, such as global warming or different management strategies for fisheries.</p>
<p>"We want to understand how the coastal ocean works in an area of high biological productivity. The first step has been to get all the people and equipment in place and coordinate our efforts," said Gary Griggs, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at UCSC and chair of CIMT's board of directors.</p>
<p>The partner institutions in CIMT are UCSC, the National Marine Fisheries Service Laboratory in Santa Cruz, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, and the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey.</p>
<p>A key part of the center's mission is to pull together a highly diverse array of data collected by a range of technologies and present the data in an integrated fashion, making it readily accessible to scientists, resource managers, and the public. Margaret McManus, an assistant professor of ocean sciences at UCSC, oversees the center's database and data visualization work.</p>
<p>"We've brought together oceanographers specializing in physical, biological, and chemical oceanography, as well as marine biologists, marine ecologists, remote sensing experts, network engineers, and data management and visualization specialists, all with the common goal of sampling coastal waters, bringing that data together in a common place, and using visualization tools to communicate it to scientists, the public, and other interested parties," McManus said.</p>
<p>CIMT scientists conduct monthly surveys of Monterey Bay on the research vessel John Martin out of Moss Landing, gathering an abundance of data on oceanographic conditions and life in the bay, from phytoplankton to whales. For more continuous measurements of oceanographic conditions, instruments are deployed on moorings in the bay. MBARI, in association with CIMT, has developed an advanced mooring system that can monitor oceanographic processes in near real-time, and the center is expanding the number of these moorings in Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>In addition to the surveys and moorings, high-frequency radar from shore-based stations is used to monitor surface currents, while satellite observations are used to measure sea surface temperatures and estimate phytoplankton abundance.</p>
<p>All these measurements are being used to investigate linkages between coastal upwelling, nutrient delivery, phytoplankton growth, and the distribution, abundance, and productivity of organisms such as squid, fish, seabirds, sea turtles, and whales.</p>
<p>"On a national level, we're one of the first projects to bring together so many different facets into an integrated system," McManus said.</p>
<p>CIMT is one of several regional efforts that are being funded as pilot projects in a nationwide effort to establish an integrated ocean observing system. NOAA and several other federal agencies are coordinating the effort, aimed at meeting national needs in the areas of detecting and forecasting oceanic components of climate variability; facilitating safe and efficient marine operations; ensuring national security; managing resources for sustainable use; preserving and restoring healthy marine ecosystems; mitigating natural hazards; and ensuring public health.</p>

<p>Veronica Tonay, a psychology instructor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a licensed clinical psychologist, wrote <em>Every Dream Interpreted</em> (London: Collins &amp; Brown Limited, 2003) for beginners and those more experienced with the realm of dream interpretation. It incorporates the latest research findings about the link between waking and dreaming, and it includes a dictionary of cross-cultural meanings of the most common symbols and elements that appear in dreams.</p>
<p>Research supports four theories about the relationship of dreams to waking life, said Tonay:</p>
<p>o Dream behavior reflects waking-life behavior, as Sigmund Freud postulated;</p>
<p>o Dream content reflects preoccupations from waking life, as Calvin Hall asserted;</p>
<p>o Feelings in dreams tend to be those we are unaware of in waking life, as Carl Jung said;</p>
<p>o All parts of dreams reflect the dreamer, as Gestalt theorists believe.</p>
<p>"None of these findings are contradictory--they are each correct about some aspect of dreams and dreaming," said Tonay. "They each speak to a different aspect of the question, 'What do my dreams mean?'"</p>
<p>Those interested in dream interpretation can use dream content to reflect on their behavior, preoccupations, and feelings in waking life, as well as for creative inspiration, to deepen communication with loved ones, and simply as entertainment, said Tonay, who is also the author of <em>The Creative Dreamer: Using Your Dreams to Unlock Your Creativity.</em></p>
<p>"Dreams are always just a little ahead of what's in our conscious mind, which makes them fascinating on many levels," said Tonay, adding that most people remember an average of one or two dreams per week, and about 60 percent of dreams are unpleasant.</p>
<p>Every Dream Interpreted presents an overview of dream research followed by two sections: Part One answers the most common questions about dreams, including:</p>
<p>o Why are my dreams important?</p>
<p>o How can I remember more of my dreams?</p>
<p>o What kinds of dreams do most people have?</p>
<p>o Are men's and women's dreams different?</p>
<p>o What do flying dreams mean?</p>
<p>o What does it mean if I have the same dream over and over again?</p>

<p>Part Two presents the meanings of the most common dream elements, which are organized into four sections: the natural environment, human characters, the animal kingdom, and buildings and other structures. This section builds on the Jungian idea that symbols hold cultural and cross-cultural meanings and express universal themes.</p>

<p>For example, it is widely known that the snake is a symbol of sexuality and the phallus in psychoanalytic literature, but other cultures view the snake as a symbol of the unconscious, death and rebirth, fear, illness, and annihilation. "The snake has several meanings, but the number is finite," said Tonay. "The question is, 'Which images appear in your dreams, and can you probe their meaning to connect with the unconscious?'"</p>
<p>For psychologists, dreams are a path to the unconscious that can help individuals learn about themselves. "People all over the world and across time have used dreams to add meaning to their lives," said Tonay. "When people find out I'm a dream researcher, they immediately tell me one of their dreams and ask me to interpret it. Everyone is curious about their dreams."</p>
