Cameron, assistant professor of art history, has been honored with a Fulbright-Hays research grant to study African culture for the 2003-04 academic year. She is one of only 33 faculty nationwide to receive this prestigious award.  </p><p>	Cameron will travel to Zambia in September to examine the visual culture, gender roles, and power relationships of African women. She plans to stay with the same family she lived with in 1992-93, when she visited the country to conduct research for her dissertation under a previous Fulbright award. </p><p>	 Cameron asserts that visual culture is essential to an understanding of how African gender roles are defined and negotiated. During her last visit, she observed the visual enactment of women's initiation arts, as well as the participation of women in men's initiation practices. This involved celebrations of motherhood, incorporating such activities as scarification, body painting, dancing, and performance with masks. On her return trip, she plans to expand her research by taking a more holistic look at Zambian culture. </p><p>"What I've proposed to do now is come back 10 years later and be with the same family, but this time look at more than initiations," she explained. "I plan to live there for the whole calendar year and really document how women organize their visual environment, and how this establishes who they are as women. I also want to show how instrumental the visual culture is in defining masculinity."</p><p>	 Cameron noted that Zambian women determine men's behavior through their control of the domestic household spaces, architecture, and ritual performances. The women also manipulate the arts and visual elements surrounding events such as marriage, pregnancy, childbirth, healing ceremonies, masquerades, political meetings, and funerals. As a result, Cameron believes that gender roles and social customs depend primarily on how these women organize their visual environment. </p><p>	Halfway through her previous research in 1992, Cameron made a fascinating discovery about the complexity of gender roles in Africa when she learned of Nyakulenga, a female chief in North-Western Province. In Zambia, the role of chief is considered masculine. Occasionally, a woman becomes chief, but though she plays the man's role in behavior and is in charge of men's affairs, she dresses and acts like a woman. Cameron likens this to finding Arnold Schwarzenegger acting hypermasculine as director of the National Organization for Women. </p><p>	"It's really important to look at this because women in that area had a lot of power and authority in the past," Cameron explained. "Then the British came in and wiped out the power they had by superimposing a western model on top of an African model. We need to look at the older model--visually and through performance--so we can understand about cultures dominating other cultures and rectify misunderstandings produced by colonialism. We need to see if there is a way for women to take back the power they once had." </p><p>	Cameron is a relatively new addition to the UCSC faculty. Prior to her appointment in 2001, she was associate curator of African art at the Los Angeles County Museum. She also served as curator of The Art of the Lega, a nationally touring exhibition produced by UCLA's Fowler Museum. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914cdcf68072704601a012ff7c272eec"><name>344</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Spring celebration of the arts at UC Santa Cruz on May 18</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1052290800000</start-date><display-name>Spring celebration of the...</display-name><path>/2003/05/344</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/05/344</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337987787</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337987787</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Jazz, opera, dance, sculpture, 3-D art, literary readings, Latin American songs, and Shakespearean theater will emanate from the tranquil gardens of the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum on Sunday, May 18, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. It's all part of "Art in the Arboretum," the annual spring celebration of creativity held on the university campus.

The findings may have important implications for the development of breast cancer.</p><p>The molecule, a signaling protein called netrin-1, has been intensively studied for its role in guiding the growth of nerve cells. The UCSC researchers, led by assistant professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology Lindsay Hinck, are the first to show a function for netrin-1 outside the nervous system.</p><p>"This was a really new concept because everybody knew about netrin-1 in the nervous system, but no one had a clue about what it did outside the nervous system," said Karpagam "Shalu" Srinivasan, a graduate student who helped make the discovery. </p><p>For nine years, Hinck has studied the role of netrin-1 in directing the development of the embryonic nervous system. Netrins are one of four major families of molecular signals that guide growing nerve cells to their targets, ultimately producing the elaborate network of connections that makes up the nervous system. When netrins connect with specific receptors on a nerve cell's surface, they prompt changes in the cell that cause it to grow toward or away from the area where netrins are concentrated. </p><p>But other researchers had found netrin-1 in different tissues, as well, suggesting additional roles for the molecule.</p><p>"About two and a half years ago I decided to start a whole new direction in the lab," Hinck said. </p><p>She decided to figure out what netrin-1 does in mammary tissue, one of the places where it had been detected. Both Hinck and Srinivasan had studied the nervous system, and the new project combined their expertise with that of research assistant Phyllis Strickland, who had done breast cancer research in another lab. Undergraduate students Ana Valdes and Grace Shin also helped with the research. The group's findings appeared in the March issue of the journal Developmental Cell.</p><p>During puberty, the mammary gland grows into the fat pad, led by the vigorous growth and branching of the gland's tips, called end buds. </p><p>"During puberty, these end buds are just plowing along at half a millimeter a day into the fat pad," Hinck said. </p><p>Hinck's group theorized that netrin-1 might guide the buds in the same way it guides nerve cells in the embryonic brain. Instead, the researchers found that it functions as a kind of glue, holding the cells of the end bud together.</p><p>Getting end bud cells to stick together in the breast may seem quite different from guiding brain cells toward or away from a target, but Hinck sees the two functions as different sides of the same coin. </p><p>"In the nervous system netrin-1 functions as a long-range cue to establish neural connections, and in the mammary gland netrin-1 acts as a short-range cue to assemble cells into an organized structure," she said.</p><p>Hinck's lab examined the effects of netrin-1 in mice. To study the role of a protein in a model organism, researchers usually "knock out" the gene that codes for that protein and see what happens. Hinck's group compared the development of mammary glands with and without the netrin-1 gene.</p><p>Both the normal and the knockout glands grew in a way that appeared normal at first look. But where end buds of normal mammary glands have tightly adhering layers of cells, each with its own function, the cell layers in the knockout buds were widely spaced and disorganized. </p><p>The researchers observed the same effect when they knocked out the gene for neogenin, a known receptor for netrin-1 in the brain. This is strong evidence that neogenin is acting as the receptor for netrin-1 in the mammary gland. As with netrin-1, Hinck's group was the first to discover a function for neogenin outside the nervous system.</p><p>"Our studies showed for the first time that without neogenin, you can see something going wrong with early mammary gland development," said Srinivasan.</p><p>Both the netrin-1 and the neogenin knockouts displayed breaks in the basal lamina, the membrane surrounding the end bud of the mammary gland. When tumors develop, an intact basal lamina is essential to contain the tumor cells and prevent metastasis of the cancer. Because of this, Hinck believes mutations in the genes for netrin-1 or neogenin may be associated with invasive breast cancer. </p><p>The group plans to test samples of human tumors to see whether their netrin-1 or neogenin genes have mutations. Hinck's lab is also investigating the roles of other signaling molecules in the mammary gland.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Lindsay Hinck at (831) 459-5253, (831) 459-2546 or hinck@biology.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914cdf578072704601a012ffec414666"><name>346</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Seafloor sediments hold clues to runaway global warming</title><author>Tim Stephens, UCSC: (831) 459-2495, stephens@ucsc.edu; Kasey White, JOI (202) 232-3900 x240, kwhite@joiscience.org</author><start-date>1052290800000</start-date><display-name>Seafloor sediments hold clues...</display-name><path>/2003/05/346</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/05/346</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337988392</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337988392</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Scientists from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and other institutions around the world arrived in Rio de Janeiro yesterday after spending two months at sea on the research ship JOIDES Resolution near an ancient submarine mountain chain off Africa, known as the Walvis Ridge. There they studied evidence of a massive release of methane that caused extreme global warming 55 million years ago.</p>
<p>This extraordinary episode of global warming, often referred to as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, is unique in Earth's history in terms of magnitude and rate of warming, as well as in the manner in which it began. Scientists think that roughly 2,000 gigatons (2 trillion tons) of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, was released to the ocean and atmosphere 55 million years ago, triggering a runaway process of global warming.</p>
<p>The scientists on Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 208 set out to test this hypothesis about the origin of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. Geochemists speculate that methane escaped from submarine clathrates, ice crystals that trap methane and are distributed in sediments on the outer edges of continental margins worldwide. For reasons that remain unknown, the clathrates suddenly began to decompose on a massive scale, increasing the amount of methane in the atmosphere and ocean. This decomposition process appears to have lasted for a period of 40,000 years, ultimately warming the planet by more than 5 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Sediments far below the seafloor hold evidence of the methane release and its consequences.</p>
<p>"The rapid release of methane 55 million years ago should have left a distinct signature in the form of calcite-poor or clay-rich layers, the distribution and thickness of which would be controlled by the total mass of methane released," said James Zachos, cochief scientist of ODP Leg 208 and professor of Earth sciences at UCSC.</p>
<p>This is because the rapid release of such a large mass of methane and its subsequent oxidation to carbon dioxide would have significantly altered ocean chemistry. The added carbon dioxide would have increased the overall acidity or corrosiveness of seawater. This, in turn, would increase the dissolution of calcite shells of microplankton, which are the dominant component of seafloor sediments, leaving behind only nonsoluble clays. The dissolution of calcite would initiate in the deepest parts of the ocean and rapidly spread upwards as additional carbon dioxide entered the ocean. The overall extent and duration of dissolution would ultimately be controlled by the total mass of methane released.</p>
<p>"By establishing the vertical extent of carbonate dissolution, as well as the duration of dissolution, it should be possible to determine the total amount of carbon dioxide that was added to the ocean during the event," Zachos said.</p>
<p>Retrieving the sediments proved to be a formidable challenge. To accurately reconstruct past climate, technicians needed to retrieve the sediments without deformation of layers and other structures.</p>
<p>"Imagine the difficulties of retrieving a layer of sediment about 1 meter thick with the consistency of mud from 200 to 300 meters below the seafloor at a water depth of 4,800 meters, without disturbing the centimeter-scale layering," said Dick Kroon, cochief scientist from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Technicians used a device known as the Advanced Piston Corer (APC) to obtain the cores. The extreme stress placed on the system, however, quickly began to take its toll on the APC. In the very first hole, the steel core barrel literally snapped in half from the enormous stresses applied while attempting to extract it from the sediment. The lower half of the barrel could not be retrieved, and the hole had to be abandoned. On several other occasions, the steel rods that secure the core barrels came back to the surface twisted or bent.</p>
<p>"At this point, we were a little concerned about whether we could achieve our objectives," Zachos said.</p>
<p>Determined, the drilling crew made the necessary repairs, adjusted their drilling strategy, and pushed on. Their efforts ultimately paid off; the thin boundary layer was recovered at five sites in water depths between 2,500 and 4,800 meters. Remarkably, at each site the layer was fully intact and in perfect condition.</p>
<p>Initial examination of the sediments provided immediate insight into the scale of calcite dissolution during this event. Micah Nicolo, a graduate student at Rice University, remarked, "When the cores were opened in the ship's lab, we were stunned by the change in colors of the sediment, from bright white carbonate to deep red clays."</p>
<p>Each core, regardless of depth, yielded a sequence of carbonate-rich sediment dissected by a distinct, dark clay layer, varying in thickness from 100 to 50 centimeters. The base of each clay layer, regardless of depth, contained essentially no calcite--indicating dissolution of calcite sediment throughout the ocean.</p>
<p>Ellen Thomas of Wesleyan University studied additional impacts of the methane release.</p>
<p>"The extent of dissolution may explain why so many bottom-dwelling organisms that precipitate calcite shells became extinct at that time," she said.</p>
<p>The scale of carbonate dissolution recorded in these cores is significant. It is suggestive of a much larger flux of methane, possibly double original estimates. It may also point toward an additional source of greenhouse gas.</p>
<p>"It far exceeds what has been estimated by models assuming a release of 2,000 gigatons of methane," Kroon said.</p>
<p>The initial results also suggest that the deposition of carbonate shells on the deeper reaches of the seafloor did not resume for at least 50,000 years, and that the total recovery time to a "normal state" took as long as 100,000 years. This result suggests that full recovery from these extreme events takes considerable time.</p>
<p>The cores recovered on this leg may also provide insight into the ultimate cause of the thermal maximum. Toward the end of the Paleocene epoch, the planet was slowly warming due to rising levels of carbon dioxide emitted from volcanoes.</p>
<p>"Several of us suspect that the melting of clathrates and rapid release of methane was initiated by gradual warming that pushed the climate system across a physical threshold," Zachos said.</p>
<p>Once started, the release of methane and resultant warming fueled the release of more methane, a positive feedback effect. This phenomenon is a concern for future global warming, Zachos said.</p>
<p>Studies of the sediment cores from Walvis Ridge and others recently recovered in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans will allow scientists to test these and other ideas about the origin of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum.</p>
<p>ODP is an international partnership of scientists and research institutions organized to study the evolution and structure of the Earth. It is funded principally by the U.S. National Science Foundation, with substantial contributions from its international partners. The Joint Oceanographic Institutions (JOI) manages the program. Texas A&amp;M University is responsible for science operations, and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University is responsible for logging services.</p>

Pullum has joined Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, journalist Walter Cronkite, philanthropist William Gates Sr., Nobel Prize-winning physicist Donald Glaser, recording industry pioneer Ray Dolby, and Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, as a newly elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>The 2003 class of 187 Fellows and 29 Foreign Honorary Members includes four college presidents, three Nobel Prize recipients, and four Pulitzer Prize winners. "It gives me great pleasure to welcome these outstanding and influential individuals to the nation's oldest and most illustrious learned society," noted Academy President Patricia Meyer Spacks. "Newly elected Fellows are selected through a highly competitive process that recognizes those who have made preeminent contributions to their disciplines."</p>

<p>As in the MacArthur "Genius" awards, the honorees have no idea they are even being considered for the Academy.</p>

<p>"I was very surprised," said Pullum. "This comes out of the blue-you don't apply. On Monday morning, a Federal Express envelope arrived from the Academy. It's quite a remarkable thing."</p>

<p>Pullum is coauthor of The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language (2002), the first definitive grammar reference book of standard international English in more than 20 years. He has published a dozen books and nearly 200 articles on the scientific study of language.</p>

<p>Pullum received his Ph.D. in general linguistics from the University of London and has been a professor at UC Santa Cruz since 1981, additionally serving as the university's dean of graduate studies and research from 1987 to 1993. One of his best-known books is The Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax, a highly entertaining collection of satirical essays about the field of linguistics.</p>
<p>The Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences has elected the most influential leaders from each generation since its founding in 1780. The list includes George Washington and Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century, Daniel Webster and Ralph Waldo Emerson in the 19th century, and Albert Einstein and Winston Churchill in the 20th century. Past elected Foreign Honorary Members have included Niels Bohr, Alfred Lord Tennyson, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Albert Camus. The current membership includes more than 150 Nobel laureates and 50 Pulitzer Prize winners.</p>
<p>New Fellows and Foreign Honorary Members are nominated and elected by current members of the Academy in five different categories--mathematics and physics; biological sciences; social sciences; arts and humanities; and public affairs and business. The members conduct interdisciplinary studies that draw on a wide of range of academic and intellectual disciplines and participate in projects that focus on both advancing intellectual thought and constructive action.</p>
<p>Other newly elected 2003 Fellows include Catherine Bertini, Undersecretary General of the United Nations and chief executive of the World Food Program; novelists Richard Ford and Peter Carey; Jeri Laber, senior adviser to Human Rights Watch; Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Laurel Thatcher Ulrich; William J. McDonough, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; and botanist Stephen P. Hubbell, founder and chairman of the National Council for Science and the Environment.</p>
<p>Pullum will travel to Cambridge, Massachusetts, in October for the annual Induction Ceremony at the Academy's headquarters.</p>

Last year, the campus expanded its summer research program to another sun-kissed locale: Thailand.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsors UCSC's Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program, which gives students 10 weeks of full-time research experience in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. This type of experience is very important for students planning to pursue graduate work in the sciences, said Rebecca Braslau, associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry, who runs the SURF program.</p>
<p>Three years ago, Braslau heard that the NSF was interested in funding similar programs in East Asia.</p>
<p>"NSF's goal was to build a cadre of globally engaged young researchers with connections in the Pacific Basin," Braslau said.</p>
<p>She managed to find contacts in Thailand to make the new program possible, and got an NSF grant to fund it. Six students from around the country traveled to Thailand last summer as the first participants in the Thai Research Experience for Undergraduates (Thai REU) program.</p>
<p>The Thai REU provides successful applicants with a 10-week placement with a mentor in an organic chemistry lab at one of three institutions in Bangkok, as well as transportation to and from Thailand, university housing, a short course in Thai language and culture, and a stipend.</p>
<p>"I was surprised how smoothly it operated and how successful it was," Braslau said. "And the NSF seemed to be quite happy with it, too."</p>
<p>Stephen Born, who graduated from UCSC last year with a double major in chemistry and molecular, cell and developmental biology, was among the first group of students in the Thai REU.</p>
<p>"It was really good," Born said. "There was a language barrier, but the Thai graduate students were incredibly helpful."</p>
<p>The Thai graduate students took the REU students on weekend trips around Thailand, so they saw more of the country than just Bangkok, Born said. Although he said switching to a rice-based diet was "interesting, to say the least," he developed a taste for the food and now cooks it himself.</p>
<p>Some things about the country surprised him: the excellent organization of systems such as public transportation; the conservatism of the culture; and the ubiquitous American brand names.</p>
<p>The laboratory setup was also different from what Born was used to, with all space shared instead of divided into individual work areas. The research itself was as rigorous as he would have expected in the United States, he said.</p>
<p>"I highly recommend an REU program to all undergraduate science students," Born said. "It opens up your eyes to a research world you might not otherwise be exposed to."</p>
<p>Thai REU students live at Chulalongkorn University and do research either there, at Mahidol University, or at the Chulabhorn Research Institute. Chulalongkorn is Thailand's oldest university and one of its most prestigious. The Chulabhorn Research Institute is run by Princess Chulabhorn Mahidol, who has a Ph.D. in organic chemistry.</p>
<p>This summer there will be eight students in the Thai REU program, selected from 55 applicants. Applications rose this year, probably because last year's participants have helped get the word out and the department has worked hard at publicizing the program, Braslau said.</p>
<p>Some participants have expressed concern about the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Asia, but Braslau said she is "pretty confident" the program can go ahead as expected. Thailand has had only two cases of the disease and enforces a strict quarantine on visitors coming from affected countries.</p>

The findings reaffirm UCSC's reputation as a center of excellence for research in astronomy and related fields.</p>
<p>The analysis was conducted by ISI (founded as the Institute for Scientific Information), a Philadelphia-based company that publishes summaries of scientific journals in Current Contents and offers a range of services involving analysis of scholarly information. The ISI survey of "high-impact universities" in space science was published on the organization's web site in February (<a href="http://in-cites.com/research/2003/february_10_2003-1.html">in-cites.com/research/2003/february_10_2003-1.html</a>).</p>
<p>ISI's rankings are based on an analysis of scholarly citations. When researchers publish a journal article, they must cite previous papers by other authors that set the stage for their work. Generally, a paper that describes important findings or ideas and influences the work of other researchers receives more citations than less influential papers. ISI analysts consider the average number of citations per paper, or "citation impact," as the most objective way to gauge the quality of a department's or an institution's research.</p>
<p>In the category of space sciences, ISI includes "astronomy and astrophysics, celestial bodies, and observation and interpretation of radiation from the component parts of the universe." The latest survey looked at the top 100 federally funded U.S. universities that published at least 300 papers in ISI-indexed journals of space science between 1997 and 2001, and ranked them by average citations per paper. UC Berkeley took the number two spot after UCSC.</p>
<p>A previous ISI survey, published in 1999, ranked UCSC number one for the impact of faculty publications in the field of astrophysics for the period 1994 to 1998.</p>
<p>"The fact that we continue to be at the top of this list means that it's not the same old papers that keep us up there. It must be because we continue to do good work," said Stan Woosley, professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC.</p>
<p>UCSC's faculty include leading researchers on both the observational and theoretical aspects of space sciences. Woosley said the campus is especially strong in three general areas of research: cosmology and extragalactic astronomy (the study of distant galaxies and the evolution of the universe); high-energy astrophysics (supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, etc.); and extrasolar planets (the discovery and characterization of planets outside the solar system).</p>
<p>Many of the astronomers at UCSC are affiliated with both the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory (UCO/Lick), which is headquartered on the UCSC campus. UCO/Lick oversees UC's participation in the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii and the Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton near San Jose. The Keck Observatory houses the world's largest optical and infrared telescopes, the twin Keck I and Keck II Telescopes. UCSC astronomers were closely involved in the design and construction of the Keck Telescopes and many of the major instruments used with them. The Lick Observatory, established in 1888, was the first major mountaintop observatory and continues to be an important research site.</p>
<p>Also based at UCSC is the Center for Adaptive Optics, a national center focused on the advancement and application of adaptive optics technology, used to correct for changing distortions that cause blurring of images. In astronomy, adaptive optics can remove the blurring effect of the Earth's atmosphere, enabling ground-based telescopes to see as clearly as space-based telescopes.</p>
<p>The center, established in 1999 and funded by the National Science Foundation, has attracted new scientists to UCSC and is supporting cutting-edge research on subjects such as black holes and extrasolar planets, in addition to advancing the technology of adaptive optics.</p>
<p>"There are new areas where we are excelling, not just the same things we were doing five years ago," Woosley said.</p>
<p>UCSC faculty in the Departments of Physics and Earth Sciences are also making important contributions in the area of space sciences and have active collaborations with their colleagues in astronomy and astrophysics. For example, the Center for Origin, Dynamics and Evolution of Planets, part of UCSC's branch of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics, brings together researchers from all three departments to study planets in our solar system and around other stars.</p>
<p>"There is a lot more interdisciplinary activity now than there was five years ago, and that may be part of the reason UCSC continues to be such a center of excellence," Woosley said.</p>

"I saw the Art Department and I thought to myself, this is where I'd like to create my work," the 21-year-old senior recalled. Apparently, she made the right decision.</p>
<p>DeGuzman has been selected as a 2003 Irwin Scholar, one of 15 select UC Santa Cruz students who will receive a $2,500 merit award to further their art education. Established in 1986, the William Hyde and Susan Benteen Irwin Scholarship fund has now grown to more than $700,000, providing annual acknowledgment to the Art Department's finest students.</p>
<p>"These scholarships are considered as recognition given by the faculty to the top 5 percent of the program," noted Norman Locks, chair of the Art Department.</p>
<p>DeGuzman's work will be showcased along with her fellow honorees at the Sesnon Art Gallery's annual exhibition of Irwin Scholars from May 21 to June 14 at Porter College. The opening reception is on Wednesday, May 21, from 5 to 7 p.m. and will include an awards ceremony. This event is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>The Sesnon show will feature a wide variety of art forms including painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, installation, and mixed media. DeGuzman said that her contribution will be a performance/installation piece.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of digital work in this show, and I feel like I'm going to be the analog piece," she explained. "The main idea is that participants will come into an environment I created and will pose a question or comment, and I'll give them a response. On the walls I'll have photographs that are significant to me that I've taken in the past three years, and strips of text about current events or my own personal history will dangle like streamers. It will all take place in an enclosed space with curtains.</p>
<p>"It's about process and self-exploration," DeGuzman added. "I want to learn more about how I work with other people. I plan to come in twice a week during the gallery exhibit to continue the performance."</p>
<p>Irwin Scholar Kimberly Seiferheld will have four sculptures on display at the show. She noted that she likes to experiment with a variety of different materials such as nails, wax, and resin in the creation of her highly personal artwork. "I'm always changing techniques and trying to perfect them," Seiferheld said. "Mostly I'm just drawn to materials and once I create a structure, it evolves from that. Most of the time I have an idea in my head, but the materials take me there."</p>
<p>Seiferheld noted that her art serves as a significant outlet for experiences and feelings that she has gone through as a woman.</p>
<p>"It's my way of working through issues that I otherwise wouldn't know how to deal with," Seiferheld said. "UCSC has allowed me to find my own style in art. They really pushed me to do that."</p>
<p>Both DeGuzman and Seiferheld plan to take a year off before applying to graduate school in art. DeGuzman said she will apply her scholarship funds toward the purchase of a video camera to help document her work and improve her portfolio.</p>

Plant resins--sticky plant secretions that harden when exposed to air--have been used as medicines, fuels, varnishes, adhesives, and perfume ingredients, to mention just a few examples. </p><p>Jean Langenheim, professor emerita and research professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has been studying amber and resins for more than 40 years. Her investigations have covered every aspect of the subject, including the chemistry of resins, their geologic history, their roles in the ecology of the plants that produce them, and their many uses throughout human history.</p><p>Langenheim has now written a comprehensive book on plant resins that reflects the depth and breadth of her knowledge as well as her enthusiasm for these fascinating plant products. <i>Plant Resins: Chemistry, Evolution, Ecology, and Ethnobotany,</i> published in May by Timber Press, is the only up-to-date scientific reference book on the subject. It is richly illustrated with  maps, color and black-and-white photos, and exquisite line drawings by UCSC alumnus Jesse Markman.</p><p>Langenheim first became interested in plant resins through her research on amber. In the early 1960s, as a research fellow at Harvard University, she conducted the first chemical analyses to determine the biological sources of amber. Although people had assumed that most amber came from the resins of pines and other conifers, Langenheim found that Mexican amber came from a tropical flowering tree. This discovery led her to conduct a comprehensive investigation of amber through geologic time, identifying the different kinds of trees that could have produced amber throughout the geologic record.</p><p>Langenheim's 1969 paper on amber in the journal Science became a classic and established her as the world's leading authority on the botanical sources of amber. She went on to conduct wide-ranging studies of resin-producing trees, the chemical and anatomical mechanisms of resin production, and the role of resins in defending plants from insects and diseases. </p><p>"You might say I got stuck in the resin," Langenheim quipped.</p><p>She identified tropical trees in the genus Hymenaea, a legume belonging to the same plant family as peas and beans, as the source of several large deposits of amber in the New World. The greatest diversity of Hymenaea species occurs in the Amazonian rain forest, where Langenheim did extensive fieldwork.</p><p>"I actually started out as an ecologist studying high-mountain vegetation, yet amber took me to the tropics," she said. "As I made some breakthroughs in chemical studies of ambers and their botanical sources, my training as an ecologist made me want to understand the plants that produce these resins and why they may have started doing it 300 million years ago."</p><p>The broad range of Langenheim's research on plant resins is one reason Timber Press approached her in 1998 to write a general reference book on the subject, the first since 1949. Langenheim's multidisciplinary approach has produced an accessible and well-integrated book that should appeal to a wide audience, including botanists, ecologists, ethnobotanists, chemists, anthropologists, archaeologists, museum conservators, and amber enthusiasts. </p><p>In the book, Langenheim suggests an improved definition of resins based on their chemical properties, the secretory mechanisms that produce them, and their ecological function. She also emphasizes the exciting future of research on resins due to the continued development of new technologies for chemical and biological studies. </p><p>The book has three main sections: the production of resins by plants; the geologic history and ecology of resins; and the ethnobotany of resins. Langenheim has done important work in all three areas.</p><p>"I've been fortunate in the way things developed. One thing led to another and I just expanded across a broad array of topics," she said. </p><p>Serendipity often introduced her to just the right person at the right time, Langenheim said. For example, when she needed to do research in Amazonia, her guide to the region was the late Richard Evans Schultes of Harvard, who had been exploring the Amazon basin since the 1940s and became known as the father of modern ethnobotany.</p><p>Jesse Markman's line drawings for the book also came about through serendipity, Langenheim said. She met Markman, a UCSC undergraduate in biology at the time, when he asked her to supervise a seminar he wanted to teach. Markman had just taken a course in science illustration, and he showed Langenheim his work just when she was wondering who she could get to do line drawings for the book. The editor at Timber Press was so impressed that he submitted some of Markman's drawings to the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, where they will be kept in the institute's collection and displayed at an international exhibition of botanical art and illustration later this year. </p><p>"It's a great honor for an artist to have their work accepted by the Hunt Institute," said Ann Caudle, coordinator of UCSC's science illustration program. "They have one of the most respected collections of botanical illustrations in the world, and they are very selective."</p><p>Langenheim joined the UCSC faculty in 1966 at the invitation of the late Kenneth Thimann, an eminent plant physiologist and one of UCSC's founding faculty. She and Thimann cotaught a course on "Plants and Human Affairs" and coauthored a book, Botany: Plant Biology and Its Relation to Human Affairs.</p><p>Langenheim has served as the president of the Association for Tropical Biology, the Ecological Society of America, the International Society of Chemical Ecology, and the Society for Economic Botany. She also represented UC on the board of directors and was academic vice president of the Organization for Tropical Studies. She has traveled throughout the world in the course of her research, but did not neglect her own backyard, studying resin production in redwoods and other Pacific Coast plants in addition to her work in the tropics.</p><p>Although technically retired for the past 10 years, Langenheim has remained very active at UCSC and still has graduate students doing research under her supervision. Frequently invited to speak before scientific gatherings, she gave St. Louis University's annual John Dwyer Lecture in Biology at the Missouri Botanical Garden in April. Her talk was entitled, "What's So Interesting about Plant Resins?"</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Langenheim at (831) 459-2918 or lang@biology.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ce8d48072704601a012ff47dcf996"><name>353</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC biologist receives lifetime achievement award&#13;

The award will be presented in July at the society's annual meeting in Vienna.</p><p>In a letter to Noller announcing the award, RNA Society president Anita Hopper wrote that the award recognizes Noller's "many, many seminal contributions to the RNA field." This is the first time the society has given a Lifetime Achievement Award. </p><p>Noller's work centers around ribosomes, which carry out protein synthesis in all living cells. The ribosome is a complex molecular machine made up of both protein and RNA, and Noller's lab has elucidated its structure and shown that the RNA component carries out its key functions, including peptide bond formation between the units of the protein product.</p><p>Noller has received numerous awards and honors for his work, and his laboratory continues to make major advances in understanding how ribosomes work. Noller and postdoctoral researcher Kurt Fredrick published a paper in the May 16 issue of the journal Science identifying a site within the ribosome that affects a key process called translocation. The genetic instructions for making a protein are copied from chromosomal DNA and carried to the ribosome by messenger RNA. Translocation refers to the ratchet-like movement of the messenger RNA molecule through the ribosome, where the genetic instructions are "translated" to make a protein molecule.</p><p>Noller and Fredrick's findings were unexpected because the site identified as important in translocation, called the peptidyl transferase center, is relatively far away from the site where translocation actually takes place.

Huge tsunami waves, spreading out from the impact site like the ripples from a rock tossed into a pond, would inundate heavily populated coastal areas. A computer simulation of an asteroid impact tsunami developed by scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, shows waves as high as 400 feet sweeping onto the Atlantic Coast of the United States.</p>
<p>The researchers based their simulation on a real asteroid known to be on course for a close encounter with Earth eight centuries from now. Steven Ward, a researcher at the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at UCSC, and Erik Asphaug, an associate professor of Earth sciences, report their findings in the June issue of the Geophysical Journal International.</p>
<p>March 16, 2880, is the day the asteroid known as 1950 DA, a huge rock two-thirds of a mile in diameter, is due to swing so close to Earth it could slam into the Atlantic Ocean at 38,000 miles per hour. The probability of a direct hit is pretty small, but over the long timescales of Earth's history, asteroids this size and larger have periodically hammered the planet, sometimes with calamitous effects. The so-called K/T impact, for example, ended the age of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.</p>
<p>"From a geologic perspective, events like this have happened many times in the past. Asteroids the size of 1950 DA have probably struck the Earth about 600 times since the age of the dinosaurs," Ward said.</p>
<p>Ward and Asphaug's study is part of a general effort to conduct a rational assessment of asteroid impact hazards. Asphaug, who organized a NASA-sponsored scientific workshop on asteroids last year, noted that asteroid risks are interesting because the probabilities are so small while the potential consequences are enormous. Furthermore, the laws of orbital mechanics make it possible for scientists to predict an impact if they are able to detect the asteroid in advance.</p>
<p>"It's like knowing the exact time when Mount Shasta will erupt," Asphaug said. "The way to deal with any natural hazard is to improve our knowledge base, so we can turn the kind of human fear that gets played on in the movies into something that we have a handle on."</p>
<p><strong>Low probability</strong></p>
<p>Although the probability of an impact from 1950 DA is only about 0.3 percent, it is the only asteroid yet detected that scientists cannot entirely dismiss as a threat. A team of scientists led by researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported on the probability of 1950 DA crossing paths with the Earth in the April 5, 2002, issue of the journal Science.</p>
<p>"It's a low threat, actually a bit lower than the threat of being hit by an as-yet-undiscovered asteroid in the same size range over the same period of time, but it provided a good representative scenario for us to analyze," Asphaug said.</p>
<p>For the simulation, the researchers chose an impact site consistent with the orientation of the Earth at the time of the predicted encounter: in the Atlantic Ocean about 360 miles from the U.S. coast. Ward summarized the results as follows:</p>
<p>The 60,000-megaton blast of the impact vaporizes the asteroid and blows a cavity in the ocean 11 miles across and all the way down to the seafloor, which is about 3 miles deep at that point. The blast even excavates some of the seafloor. Water then rushes back in to fill the cavity, and a ring of waves spreads out in all directions. The impact creates tsunami waves of all frequencies and wavelengths, with a peak wavelength about the same as the diameter of the cavity. Because lower-frequency waves travel faster than waves with higher frequencies, the initial impulse spreads out into a series of waves.</p>
<p>"In the movies they show one big wave, but you actually end up with dozens of waves. The first ones to arrive are pretty small, and they gradually increase in height, arriving at intervals of 3 or 4 minutes," Ward said.</p>
<p>The waves propagate all through the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean. The waves decay as they travel, so coastal areas closest to the impact get hit by the largest waves. Two hours after impact, 400-foot waves reach beaches from Cape Cod to Cape Hatteras, and by four hours after impact the entire East Coast has experienced waves at least 200 feet high, Ward said. It takes 8 hours for the waves to reach Europe, where they come ashore at heights of about 30 to 50 feet.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Computer simulations</strong></p>
<p>Computer simulations not only give scientists a better handle on the potential hazards of asteroid impacts, they can also help researchers interpret the geologic evidence of past events, Ward said. Geologists have found evidence of past asteroid impact tsunamis in the form of inland sediment deposits and disturbed sediment layers in the seafloor that correlate with craters, meteorite fragments, and other impact evidence. An important feature of Ward's simulation is that it enabled him to calculate the speed of the water flows created by the tsunami at the bottom of the ocean--more than 3 feet per second out to distances of several hundred miles from the impact.</p>
<p>"That's like a raging river, so as these waves cross the ocean they're going to stir up the seafloor, eroding sediments on the slopes of seamounts, and we may be able to identify more places where this has happened," Ward said.</p>
<p>He added that the waves may also destabilize undersea slopes, causing landslides that could trigger secondary tsunamis. Ward has also done computer simulations of tsunamis generated by submarine landslides. He showed, for example, that the collapse of an unstable volcanic slope in the Canary Islands could send a massive tsunami toward the U.S. East Coast.</p>
<p>A tsunami warning system has been established for the Pacific Ocean involving an international effort to evaluate earthquakes for their potential to generate tsunamis. Ward said that asteroid impact tsunamis could also be incorporated into such a system.</p>
<p>"Tsunamis travel fast, but the ocean is very big, so even if a small or moderate-sized asteroid comes out of nowhere you could still have several hours of advance warning before the tsunami reaches land," he said. "We have a pretty good handle on the size of the waves that would be generated if we can estimate the size of the asteroid."</p>
<p>Planetary scientists, meanwhile, are getting a better handle on the risks of asteroid impacts. A NASA-led campaign to detect large asteroids in near-Earth orbits is about half way toward its goal of detecting 90 percent of those larger than 1 kilometer in diameter (the size of 1950 DA) by 2008.</p>
<p>"Until we detect all the big ones and can predict their orbits, we could be struck without warning," said Asphaug. "With the ongoing search campaigns, we'll probably be able to sound the 'all clear' by 2030 for 90 percent of the impacts that could trigger a global catastrophe."</p>
<p>Rogue comets visiting the inner solar system for the first time, however, may never be detected very long in advance. Smaller asteroids that can still cause major tsunami damage may also go undetected.</p>
<p>"Those are risks we may just have to live with," Asphaug said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://es.ucsc.edu/~ward/1950-DA(5).mov</url><title>Movie of tsunami simulation</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://es.ucsc.edu/~ward/papers/gji_final_35N.pdf</url><title>Paper in Geophysical Journal International</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914cecd88072704601a012ff7f30cc5a"><name>356</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz celebrates the life of Lionel Cantu on May 30</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1054018800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz celebrates...</display-name><path>/2003/05/356</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/05/356</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337991848</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337991848</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The sudden death last year of 36-year-old sociologist Lionel Cantú stunned his family, friends, and colleagues at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who have established a memorial scholarship fund to honor Cantú's life and work.

<strong>What:</strong>The workshop will focus on the roles of China, India, and Silicon Valley and the opportunities for competition and partnership that accompany global economic change.<br/>
<br/>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Friday, May 30, 2003, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> UC Santa Cruz Silicon Valley Regional Center, Moffett Field</p>
<p><strong>Who:</strong> A full workshop schedule is available online at <a href="http://sccie.ucsc.edu/events/GlobalIT/">http://sccie.ucsc.edu/events/GlobalIT/</a>.</p>
<p>Among the participants are AnnaLee Saxenian, author of Silicon Valley's New Immigrant Entrepreneurs and Regional Advantage: Culture and Competition in Silicon Valley and Route 128 and a UC Berkeley professor in the School of Information Management and Systems and the Department of City and Regional Planning; Alok Aggarwal, former director of IBM's India Research Laboratory and cofounder and chairman of Evalueserve; and Rafiq Dossani, a consulting professor at Stanford University's Asia/Pacific Research Center.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Silicon Valley is already strongly tied to China and India through entrepreneurs, investment, and technology. The coming decades will see these ties deepen, with China and India becoming even more central players and markets for California and each other. For Silicon Valley, the central question is whether China and India will be competitors, partners, or merely markets in the global IT industry.</p>
<p>Technology itself is partly a driver of the changing relationship. As telecommunications technology has reached around the globe, China and India have emerged as key providers of IT services. "We never thought it would make sense to move services overseas because we require contact to provide service, but all that has changed as it costs the same to call Idaho as to call India, where services can be provided at one-third to one-quarter the cost," said Nirvikar Singh, professor of economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and co-director of the UCSC Center for International Economics (SCCIE), which is cosponsoring the workshop.</p>
<p>Technology provides the opportunity, but how Silicon Valley, Chinese, and Indian companies manage these new relationships -- and issues of security, reliability, and national interest -- remains an open question. Already the manufacturing "workshop of the world," China is developing new ties with India as companies in both nations become global forces in their own right. "The effect may be not only cheaper servicing of the U.S. market but also more effective servicing of the Asian market," Singh said.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley remains an unparalleled center of IT innovation, management, and partnership for both nations. But the nature of the global IT industry is dynamic -- with technologies, markets, and human networks in constant evolution -- and requires new perspectives and insights on the future.</p>

Admission is $8 general, $7 students.</p>
<p>The program will include selected personal films by department chair Chip Lord, Associate Professor Lawrence Andrews, Assistant Professor Gustavo Vazquez, and lecturer Irene Gustafson.</p>
<p>"They are all nonfiction films or documentaries, but none fall in the traditional documentary form as we know it," noted Lord. "They're not Ken Burns-style documentaries; none of these films really have interviews. They've all been shaped as a work of art. We're artists working in digital video with nonfictional material."</p>
<p>"I think this program is representative of what the production faculty do in our department," Lord added.</p>
<p><strong>Program:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Irene Gustafson</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Distracted: A Trip Around the World</em> 15:00 minutes 1997</strong></p>
<p>This experimental documentary narrates a journey through the impossible spatial and temporal landscape of a 1950s-era miniature golf course.</p>
<p><strong>Gustavo Vazquez</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>RE:Group/No Homeland (A post 9/11 intercultural Poltergeist)</em> 12:00 minutes 2003</strong></p>
<p>Filmmaker Gustavo Vazquez was asked to produce a segment for a PBS documentary on "new performance art in San Francisco." Vazquez, in turn, decided to work with his colleague Guillermo GÃ³mez-PeÃ±a and shoot a jam session of a new collective named Re:Group. PBS ended up censoring 80 percent of the footage. This video consists of the outtakes of the work session where Re:Group explores the new culture of fear, paranoia, censorship, and superficial jingoism permeating every corner of society.</p>
<p><strong>Chip Lord &amp; Gustavo Vazquez</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>El ZÃ³calo</em> 28:30 minutes 2002</strong></p>
<p>El ZÃ³calo is an observational portrait of Mexico City's central Plaza de la ConstituciÃ³n across one day in August. Soldiers, Aztec dancers, clowns, food vendors, protestors, rain, dogs, tourists, kites, balloons, and dignitaries all meet in the public space of the ZÃ³calo. This documentary observes daily life in one of the largest and most vibrant urban centers in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Lawrence Andrews</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>we just tellin stories</em> 57:00 minutes 2001</strong></p>
<p>We just tellin stories is about the Medea Project for incarcerated women. It shows the process that enables this theater ensemble to take a group of incarcerated women to a place where they are able tell their often painful and disturbing stories publicly. During the process of building a stage play, they reclaim a sense of self-worth and the ability to dream again. The telling and retelling of tragic personal stories becomes the way they gain new perspectives on what they have lived through. Ultimately, their stories are presented to sold-out audiences and do nothing less than rock the house.</p>
<p>UCSC's Media Theater is located between the Mainstage and the Baskin Arts complex in the Performing Arts area on campus. Advance tickets are available at Streetlight Records, the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, and the Santa Cruz Metro Office. For more information, call (831) 459-3204.</p>

The project will use nanoscale engineering of materials to develop efficient technology for direct conversion of thermal energy to electric energy. It is funded by a five-year grant from the Office of Naval Research that provides up to $1.2 million per year spread among seven institutions.</p><p> "The Navy is interested in electric ships, but this technology will also be useful for electric cars and any other vehicle that needs electricity," said Ali Shakouri, an associate professor of electrical engineering at UCSC and principal investigator on the grant project. </p><p>Car engines are notoriously inefficient: Only about one-third of the energy they generate goes to propelling the car. The rest dissipates as heat, and keeping the engine cool presents an engineering problem of its own. Devising a way to turn some of that heat into useful energy would enable a car to travel further on less fuel.</p><p>"The current systems for converting heat to electricity are turbine-based, heavy, noisy, and not very efficient," Shakouri said. "What we are working on has no moving parts."</p><p>Shakouri heads the multi-institutional team of researchers working on the project. The researchers will explore the capacity of thinly layered materials to channel the random jostling of heat energy into the orderly flow of electricity. They hope to reach 20 percent efficiency for this conversion.</p><p>Scientists have understood the principles behind the conversion, known as the Seebeck effect and thermionic emission, for some time. When one side of a material is hotter than the other, electrons on the hot side move faster. In the process, some will find their way to the cold side, and this flow creates electricity. But previous attempts to harness this principle to generate power have required huge temperature differences and attained only about 6 percent efficiency.</p><p>Shakouri's team hopes to change this using the revolutionary new techniques of nanotechnology, which enables scientists to manipulate the properties of a material or device by precisely positioning its atoms.</p><p>"The ability to do nanoscale engineering of the materials has been a major advance," Shakouri said. </p><p>Three key properties will enable a material to efficiently convert heat energy to electricity, Shakouri said. First, it must allow "hot" electrons to move easily into the cold area, a characteristic known as electrical conductivity. Since electrons will flow only as long as the material maintains a temperature difference, the material must also be a thermal insulator. And finally, "hot" electrons must flow more easily than "cold" ones. Putting tiny vacuum gaps between the hot and cold sides of the device are one way this might be achieved, since hot electrons, but not heat itself, could jump across the gap.</p><p>Shakouri and some other members of the team have worked on a similar problem before, but with a different goal: refrigeration. They are currently improving a nanoscale cooling device that can be applied as a thin layer on a computer chip. The electric current flowing through the chip creates a temperature difference between the layers of the device, and suctions heat away from the chip. </p><p>The car engine device would essentially reverse this process, surrounding the engine and using the temperature difference between the engine and its surroundings to generate electric current.</p><p>"In this project, both solid-state materials and small vacuum gaps will be investigated to improve the preferential flow of hot electrons," Shakouri said.</p><p>The research team is divided into five smaller groups, each assigned a particular task, such as theoretical modeling, making or testing materials, or demonstrating the overall system. Though work on the project will go on at institutions from Santa Barbara to Cambridge, Massachusetts, its center will be Shakouri's lab, which will perform device design and system analysis and will determine which paths the research should take.</p><p>The institutions involved are UC Santa Cruz, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, North Carolina State University, Purdue University, UC Berkeley, and UC Santa Barbara.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Shakouri at (831) 459-3821 or ali@soe.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914cf2188072704601a012ff43f43378"><name>360</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New book on Silicon Valley achievers refutes myth of Superwoman</title><author>Scott Rappaport (831) 459-2495, srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1052377200000</start-date><display-name>New book on Silicon...</display-name><path>/2003/05/360</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/05/360</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337993166</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337993166</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>For the past three decades, women have been told that they can have it all--a high-powered professional career, loving family, and satisfying personal relationship--if only they learn how to properly organize their time. But a new book, coauthored by UC Santa Cruz lecturer Peggy Downes Baskin, reveals that the lives of successful female executives contradict this advice.</p>
<p><em>Beyond Superwoman</em> is based on candid interviews with 25 top Silicon Valley executives including Donna Dubinsky, founder of Palm Pilot, Kathy Levinson, president of E*Trade, M.R.C. Greenwood, chancellor of UC Santa Cruz, Kathleen Sullivan, dean of Stanford Law School, Susan Hammer, mayor of San Jose, Jackie Speier, California State Senator, and Ann Livermore, vice-president of Hewlett-Packard. The book explores the work/life patterns of this new breed of female worker who has rejected the "Superwoman syndrome."</p>
<p>"What we found runs contrary to the advice commonly given in magazines, by relatives, and the community," said coauthor Karin Strasser Kauffman, a former Monterey County Supervisor, university professor, and founding chair of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Council. "Women are constantly told that if they plan carefully, they can do it all. But the women in Silicon Valley made it very clear that this advice is unrealistic, dangerous to physical and mental well-being, and ultimately counterproductive."</p>
<p>The authors discovered, that without exception, the Silicon Valley CEOs did not attempt to try to achieve a balance between their personal and professional lives. Instead, they sequenced their lives, concentrating on doing one thing at a time, and doing it well. As the authors point out in the book's introduction:</p>
<p>"The majority of women leaders in Silicon Valley consciously and constantly re-evaluate their lives, adjust their pace, and pull back from that edge through a creative array of lifestyle changes. They adapt to stress. They reinvent themselves as they rise through the ranks."</p>
<p>To simplify their lives, each of these influential women let something go. Some concentrated on their family first, and began their career later in life. Others focused on their career from the beginning, but later stepped down in order to focus on other priorities, including family. Although they found a wide variety of paths, the authors identified several patterns characteristic of the new breed of women.</p>
<p>"These women sometimes work 80 hours a week, but universally, they love their jobs," noted Downes Baskin. "They are all self-starters with great drive, energy and determination to overcome obstacles and keep going. And they changed jobs frequently. The idea is to take a skill set with you and move to something else, even change skills. You've got to be flexible, always with your eye to the next thing."</p>
<p>Downes Baskin has devoted a significant portion of her professional career to women's issues and currently serves on the boards of three college and university foundations. Now a senior lecturer in women's studies at UC Santa Cruz, she also taught politics at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley for 18 years.</p>
<p>"Women are learning that they can take five years off and still feel they have time to pull in and out of the job market," Downes Baskin added. "They're getting the big picture now."</p>
<p>Written in a practical, easy-to-read style, the book provides a compelling glimpse into the lifestyles of women who have risen to the top of previously male-dominated professions. Although they interviewed very special women in the extremely tough work environment of Silicon Valley, the authors noted that the book still offers plenty of advice for the average working woman.</p>
<p>"Each chapter has something that could resonate with anyone making their way up the career ladder, or who is considering re-entry into academics or the job market," Downes Baskin said.</p>
<p>"We didn't aim to put out an academic study," added Strasser Kauffman. "Instead, we were thinking: 'wouldn't it be exciting if we could come up with some practical advice for women'?"</p>
