Brown Classics Endowment at the University Library. </p><p>In honor of the late Norman O. Brown, a distinguished humanist and influential professor at UC Santa Cruz, the endowment is designed to enrich the library collection in classical studies. Income from the endowment will focus on studies of the history, literature, philosophy, and culture of ancient Greece and Rome, with an initial emphasis on resources in Greek and Roman history. </p><p>"This is an essential contribution to the intellectual life of the university--to the faculty and students, both undergraduates and graduates," noted Karen Bassi, associate professor of classics at UC Santa Cruz. "Especially in these times of dwindling resources in the library holdings of humanities materials.</p><p>"This gift will enable students to embark on new research areas in classics. The library holdings are the front lines of new research," Bassi added.</p><p>Engel and his family have been longtime supporters of the University Library. His parents, Ruth and Samuel Engel, served on the Board of Directors of the Friends of the Library for many years, and Engel has himself been a board member for the past decade. In 1996, along with his brother Charles, Engel established the Ruth Franklin Engel Horticulture Collection Fund to provide enriched support for the library collections in horticulture, gardening, and related fields. </p><p>Engel graduated from Cowell College at UC Santa Cruz in 1975 with a B.A. degree in philosophy. Along with three other members of his graduating class, he attended Harvard Law School. "I dropped out after a year--the main thing I learned was that the law wasn't for me," he recalled. For the past two decades, he has worked as the managing editor of the Norman and Charlotte Strouse Edition of the Writings of Thomas Carlyle, a project spearheaded by UC Santa Cruz literature professor Murray Baumgarten and published by UC Press. </p><p>"I've always been interested in classics,"  Engel noted. "And I did a lot of research in the library. I was planning to write a historical novel about a Roman emperor, but it never happened. I'm specifically interested in Greek and Roman history. It's been a lifelong hobby."</p><p>The UC Santa Cruz Library currently has more than 60 endowments established by donors in a wide range of subjects from Jewish Studies to the Pacific Rim. The endowments are a significant means of expanding the library collection by providing a source of ongoing support for acquisitions in a specific area of interest.</p><p>"UC libraries in general are underfunded for humanities because materials for the sciences are so expensive, and the amount of state aid that goes to libraries seems to be less than what we might hope for," Engel said. "These endowments are a great way to fill in the relative gaps in certain subject areas."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914cc67e8072704601a012ffbfa09609"><name>324</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Nobel laureate J.

Michael Bishop, chancellor of UC San Francisco and a leading cancer researcher, will give a public talk at the University of California, Santa Cruz, on Thursday, April 17. Bishop's talk, entitled "Cancer: The Rise of the Genetic Paradigm," will start at 4 p.m. in the Stage Room at the Colleges Nine/Ten Dining Commons. There will be a reception immediately after the lecture.</p><p>Bishop's talk is the third annual Sinsheimer Distinguished Lecture in Biology, sponsored this year by UCSC's Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology. The event is free and open to the public. Designated parking for this event is in the North Residential Lot, with shuttle service to the event site.</p><p>Bishop is one of the world's foremost medical researchers and an award-winning teacher. He shared the 1989 Nobel Prize in medicine/physiology with Harold Varmus, now president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. They won the award for discovering that normal cells contain genes that can cause cancer if they malfunction. Their discovery is widely credited with sparking a revolution in cancer research. </p><p>Bishop directs the G. W. Hooper Research Foundation at UCSF, which conducts multidisciplinary research on human disease. He maintains an active research lab with a focus on the molecular basis of cancer. His research aims to determine how normal cells govern their replication and why cancer cells do not. </p><p>A member of the UCSF faculty since 1968, Bishop has twice received the campus's Kaiser Award for Excellence in Teaching. In 1994, he was appointed a University Professor, the highest honor UC can bestow on a professor in recognition of superior scholarship and teaching. </p><p>Bishop's many honors and awards include the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award, the Armand Hammer Cancer Prize, and the Award for Distinguished Research in the Biomedical Sciences from the American Association of Medical Colleges. He is a member of several professional and honorary societies, including the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and is coauthor of three books and nearly 400 scientific papers, publications, and reviews.</p><p>The Sinsheimer Distinguished Lectureship in Biology is supported by an endowment from UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Emeritus Robert L. Sinsheimer and his wife, Karen. Robert Sinsheimer, who was chancellor from 1977 to 1987, is a renowned molecular biologist and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Hosting of the annual lecture alternates between the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and the Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology.</p><p>For more information about the lecture, contact the University Events Office at  (831) 459-1438.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914cc7b78072704601a012fff2c26f9e"><name>326</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz Genome Browser provides a portal for scientific exploration of finished human genome sequence</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>bioinformatics, human genome</keywords><start-date>1050303600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz Genome...</display-name><path>/2003/04/326</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/04/326</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337982332</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1510792261877</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As leaders of the Human Genome Project announced the project's successful completion at a press conference today in Bethesda, MD, bioinformatics researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, made the completed reference sequence of the human genome publicly available on the web-based UCSC Genome Browser (<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">http://genome.ucsc.edu</a>). This was also the first site to make the initial working draft of the human genome publicly available in June 2000.</p>
<p>The UCSC Genome Browser provides a web-based "microscope" for exploring the human genome sequence and is used daily by thousands of biomedical researchers throughout the world, said David Haussler, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and holder of the UC Presidential Chair in Computer Science at UCSC.</p>
<p>"We have now built the browser on top of the finished genome sequence. That sequence will serve as a new foundation for medicine and human biology, and our browser will form the most popular portal to explore our shared genetic heritage," said Haussler, who directs UCSC's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE).</p>
<p>The center's Genome Bioinformatics Group worked long hours to get the browser ready for today's announcement of the finished sequence. HHMI postdoctoral researcher Terrence Furey led an effort to ensure that the locations of as many known genes as possible were identified in the genome sequence.</p>
<p>CBSE research scientist James Kent, who earlier assembled the first working draft of the human genome, created the UCSC Genome Browser. The browser displays the genome in alignment with dozens of annotation tracks contributed by researchers at UCSC and collaborators worldwide.</p>
<p>"We have 51 annotation tracks aligned with the genome sequence, so the browser is very rich in information," said Fan Hsu, director of proteomics at CBSE.</p>
<p>The browser is now maintained by a team of engineers led by Kent. It is linked to key additional resources at the European Bioinformatics Institute (<a href="http://www.ensembl.org">http://www.ensembl.org</a>) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to Haussler, Kent, Furey, and Hsu, many other members of the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics group worked long hours to ensure the success of the UCSC Genome Browser and human genome data releases. They include Matt Schwartz, Angie Hinrichs, Heather Trumbower, Donna Karolchik, Chuck Sugnet, Mark Diekhans, Ryan Weber, Robert Baertsch, Yontao Lu, Krishna Roskin, and several other graduate students in the Haussler lab.</p>
<p>As the focus of the human genome research community shifts from sequencing to sequence analysis, the UCSC Genome Browser is well positioned to fill an essential role in uncovering the causes, treatments, and prevention of disease and in exploring our shared genetic heritage, Haussler said.</p>
<p>"The Human Genome Sequencing Consortium has given us an extraordinary gift. The finished human genome sequence is like a finely polished mirror, reflecting ourselves at the molecular level with unprecedented scope and accuracy," he said. "I am extremely proud that the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics group has been able to play a role in this great achievement."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914cc8d98072704601a012ffe4abb5db"><name>327</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New offerings highlight selection at annual UC Santa Cruz Plant Sale May 3-4</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>plant sale, ucsc farm &amp; garden</keywords><start-date>1050390000000</start-date><display-name>New offerings highlight selection...</display-name><path>/2003/04/327</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/04/327</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337982634</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337982634</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The inspiring selection of organic plants for sale at the UC Santa Cruz Farm &amp; Garden's annual spring plant sale will be even greater this year with the addition of several new ornamentals and edibles.</p>
<p>The plant sale will take place on Saturday and Sunday, May 3-4, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the Barn Theater parking lot at the intersection of Bay and High Streets at the base of campus.</p>
<p>As always, a wide selection of organically raised plants will be available, including more than 200 species of vegetables, annual flowers, perennials, herbs, and "everlastings," or dried flowers. All plants are proven to grow well in the local area.</p>
<p>Among the highlights of this year's new offerings are:</p>
<p>- Big Leaf Maple, Acer macrophyllum. Grown from seed collected below the Chadwick Garden on the UCSC campus, big leaf maple is part of the native mixed evergreen and deciduous forest and is appropriate for an open woodland setting.</p>
<p>- Good King Henry, Chenopodium bonus henricus. A European native related to beets, spinach, and chard, Good King Henry is an edible green with a spinach- or quinoa-like texture and flavor.</p>
<p>- Ivy Leaf Sage, Blue Vine Sage, Salvia cacaliaefolia. Native to Chiapas State in Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras, this salvia's blue flowers rise right out of the top of the lush green foliage.</p>
<p>- Lavandula x intermedia, "Seal" and "Super": These relatively large lavender cultivars grow to 3 1/2 x 3 1/2 feet and feature long, soft, slender, blue-gray foliage and a relatively dense canopy if well pruned. The flowers of "Super" are a darker lavender; those of "Seal" are mid-lavender blue.</p>
<p>- Monkshood, Aconitum arendsii. This delphinium relative sports gorgeous, deep-purple flowers and can throw a 4 - 5-foot-high flower spike.</p>
<p>- Penstemon grinnelli. A striking penstemon with vibrant silvery-blue foliage and broad iridescent lavender-blue flowers in summer.</p>
<p>- Penstemon pinifolius. A native of the Southwest, this fine-leaved penstemon is an extremely hardy and heat-adapted species unique in its slender, needle-like foliage and long, slim, reddish-orange flowers.</p>
<p>- Penstemon spectabilis. Similar to P. grinnelli, this species features more elongated and slender corolla tubes and slightly deeper lavender-blue flowers.</p>
<p>The vegetable selection will include an impressive array of heirloom varieties of hot, mild, and sweet peppers and a tomato selection to satisfy every gardener and gourmet. Six-packs of lettuces, broccoli, cauliflower, salad mix, and Asian greens will also be available.</p>
<p>The flower selection includes a wide variety of sunflowers, yarrows, zinnias, alstroemeria, roses, and penstemons, as well as columbine, coral bells, statice, and Japanese anemone. Medicinal and culinary herbs will also be available.</p>
<p>Sponsored by the Friends of the Farm &amp; Garden and the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems, the sale will benefit the UCSC Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture. Members of the Friends will receive early entry from 9 to 10 a.m. on Saturday only and a 10 percent discount on purchases; memberships will be available at the sale beginning at 8:30 a.m. For more information, call (831) 459-3240.</p>

This marks the third consecutive year that the university has received the honor.</p><p>"This grant program rewards excellence in film production, and especially cinematography, by enabling film schools to undertake production projects beyond their normal budgetary scope," noted John Mason, director of Kodak's Student Filmmaker Program.  </p><p>This year's grant will go primarily to support UCSC's upper-division film and video curriculum. </p><p>"It allows us to provide students with film stock so they can shoot test reels and do assignments," explained lecturer Irene Gustafson. "Film is very expensive and students might otherwise choose not to work with it. This gives them experience in working with that medium, and they can then choose whether they want to continue their individual projects on film or use digital."</p><p>Although nearly all the feature films coming out of Hollywood today are now shot on film, the industry is gradually moving toward the use of digital video technology.</p><p>"George Lucas shot his most recent Star Wars film entirely with high-definition digital cameras," Gustafson said. "He's a huge supporter of digital--that's the trend for the future."</p><p>Gustafson stressed, however, that film is still an extremely viable medium and particularly well suited for the teaching process.</p><p>"Film is a photographic process," Gustafson said. "Students shoot it and have to go through the calculations and adjustments of aperture and focus. I find it useful in teaching because students are forced to take so much care in thinking about the image in terms of framing, color, and exposure.</p><p>"Students take video for granted because with a video camera, the image is always there," she added. "I think 16mm film encourages particular skills--it requires attention to pre-production and planning. Students can then apply these skills to their video projects as well."</p><p>UCSC's Film and Digital Media Department chair Chip Lord noted that film has a slightly sharper image than video and can also present a wider range of contrast. He said that many filmmakers are now using a hybrid approach--utilizing the fidelity of 16mm film in combination with the flexibility of non-linear digital editing. </p><p>"In this transition period, people are shooting films on digital video, editing on computer, and in the final process going to film for distribution," Lord observed.</p><p>Both Gustafson and Lord agree that given the past 100 years of film's history, its legacy will always be with us.</p><p> </p><p>"I still think it's a valuable medium," Gustafson said. "I don't think that film is quite yet the 8-track of images," she added. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ccb778072704601a012ff0bf38645"><name>329</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz Arboretum will hold annual spring plant sale on Saturday, April 26</title><author>Stephen McCabe (831) 427-2998; smccabe@ucsc.edu; Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>UC Santa Cruz Arboretum, California Native Plant Society, plant sale</keywords><start-date>1050562800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz Arboretum...</display-name><path>/2003/04/329</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/04/329</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337983282</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337983282</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Brighten up your garden with kangaroo paws, pincushion flowers, and sweet-smelling blossoms from the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum. </p><p>The Arboretum is holding its annual Spring Plant Sale in conjunction with the California Native Plant Society on Saturday, April 26, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The sale will take place at the Arboretum's Eucalyptus Grove on High Street near the intersection with Western Drive.</p><p>The annual sale features plants that grow especially well in the Monterey Bay Area.

An array of computer-based strategies is now available to help molecular biologists who have found an unknown protein, determined its sequence of amino acid subunits, and want to know its three-dimensional structure and biological function. </p><p>Computational techniques alone may not provide all the answers, but they are powerful enough to have earned a place in the standard toolkit for protein research. The Sequence Alignment and Modeling System (SAM), introduced in the early 1990s by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has become one of the most popular software packages for the analysis of protein sequences. </p><p>SAM now faces stiff competition, but UCSC researchers keep improving the software and are working on other software programs to complement it. Both academic researchers and commercial companies are among the users of the SAM software. </p><p>"We have licensed the SAM software to more than 200 academic research groups and about 20 commercial companies. We also have a web server that sees over 1,000 uses per week for protein structure prediction," said Richard Hughey, professor and chair of computer engineering at UCSC.</p><p>The list of companies that have licenced the SAM software from UCSC reads like a Who's Who of the biotechnology industry: Affymetrix, Celera, Genentech, Novartis, Pfizer, and Pharmacia, among others. While commercial companies must pay a fee to use the software (as much as $125,000), academic licenses are free, Hughey said.</p><p>Proteins carry out most of the crucial functions of living cells. They are typically large molecules with very complex shapes. Their structural and functional diversity surpasses that of any other kind of molecule. Enzymes, antibodies, hormones, muscle, tendons, cartilage, hair, and feathers are all made of proteins. </p><p>At the simplest level, proteins are long chains of subunits called amino acids. There are 20 different amino acids, and their sequence in the linear chain of a protein molecule ultimately determines its structure. Sections of the molecule may twist into coils or fold into sheets, and the entire protein folds into a precise and often highly complex three-dimensional structure.</p><p>Software programs such as SAM take advantage of the structural similarities of related proteins and the existence of large databases of information on known proteins. Proteins that share a common ancestor have many similarities in their amino acid sequences. These similarities make it possible to create statistical models of families of related proteins. A software program can compare an unknown protein's sequence with such statistical models and may be able to predict the protein's structure based on its similarity to known proteins. </p><p>SAM uses a statistical technique known as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), first introduced to the field of bioinformatics by David Haussler, holder of the UC Presidential Chair in computer science and director of UCSC's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering. The SAM software was initially developed by Haussler, postdoctoral researcher Anders Krogh, now at the University of Copenhagen, and others. Haussler later focused on DNA sequence analysis, and further development of the SAM software was taken over by Hughey and Kevin Karplus, professor of computer engineering.</p><p>SAM has a history of success in an unusual series of group experiments performed every two years to establish the state of the art in protein structure prediction. The Fifth Community Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction <a href="http://predictioncenter.llnl.gov/casp5/Casp5.html">(CASP5)</a> concluded in December 2002. </p><p>The top performers in one category of the CASP5 experiment were "metaservers" that combined several different servers, including SAM, and looked for agreement between different methods, Karplus said. "The success of the metaservers was somewhat unexpected--these automatic methods outperformed most human predictors," he said.</p><p>UCSC entered two versions of SAM (SAM-T99 and a newer version, SAM-T02) in CASP5, as well as a new program Karplus is developing called Undertaker. Undertaker is designed to predict protein folding based on the tendency for parts of a protein molecule that are hydrophobic--literally "water-fearing"--to be buried inside the structure where they won't come in contact with water. </p><p>"The burial of hydrophobic residues is one of the main driving forces in protein folding, and Undertaker is an attempt to use that to predict new folds," Karplus said. </p><p> </p><p>He found that the combination of Undertaker with SAM did not perform as well as SAM alone on the easier targets, where there was a good alignment of the unknown sequence with a known template. The combined programs did surprisingly well, however, on some of the hardest problems, Karplus said.</p><p>"Where our methods had started failing in the past, that's where we started succeeding," he said. "We still have a lot of work to do, but I think we can improve even more over the next year."</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Hughey at (831) 459-2939 or rph@cse.ucsc.edu and Karplus at (831) 459-4250 or karplus@soe.ucsc.edu. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914cce0a8072704601a012ff4eb67eb4"><name>331</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Research Review Day at UCSC Engineering School will highlight faculty research projects</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1051081200000</start-date><display-name>Research Review Day at...</display-name><path>/2003/04/331</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/04/331</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337983960</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337983960</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Leading faculty and researchers in the Baskin School of Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will present their latest findings during a Research Review Day on Monday, May 5.

This event will feature prominent scholars from the United States, Poland, England, Hungary, Israel, and South Africa, who will examine anti-Semitism from both a historical and contemporary perspective. Admission is free and open to the public.</p><p>Dr. Yehuda Bauer, one of the world's premier historians of the Holocaust, will be a featured guest speaker at the conference. He is the founding director of the Center for Contemporary Jewry at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and director emeritus of Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Museum in Israel. Bauer will join several of his colleagues in discussing current developments in the Middle East and Europe, including Islamic anti-Semitism.</p><p>Although the Holocaust became a major subject of scholarly investigation in the 1960s, recent developments suggest that the time has come for a reappraisal of the subject of anti-Semitism. For example, documented news reports gathered by the Anti-Defamation League and other organizations tell of a recent worldwide resurgence of anti-Semitism, particularly in the wake of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. </p><p>"There has never been this kind of conference connecting the Holocaust to contemporary anti-Semitism," notes Murray Baumgarten, professor of English and comparative literature at UC Santa Cruz and co-coordinator of the event. "This conference is a timely and important event designed to challenge current assumptions and refocus perceptions about anti-Semitism."</p><p>Participants in the conference will examine the varieties of anti-Semitism during the Holocaust and in the current crisis, the relationship between populist and government-inspired anti-Semitism, and its various representations in literature, cinema, and popular culture. </p><p>The conference will begin at 7 p.m. on May 3 with a keynote address by UCSC history professor and conference co-coordinator Peter Kenez. Distinguished Hungarian director Peter Forgacs will then introduce his film Danube Exodus and participate in a panel discussion following the screening. Professor Bauer will deliver the plenary address on May 4 at 11:15 a.m. (He will also give a second address at Sonoma State University on May 6, and will speak in San Francisco at Temple Emanu-El on May 7). </p><p>Conference exhibits will include a multimedia installation describing the ongoing history of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a fraudulent tract describing a supposed Jewish plot for world domination that is known to be an invention of the intelligence services of Czarist Russia. Reprinted copies of the book have recently been found across the globe from Baghdad to Hoboken, New Jersey. </p><p>An extensive exhibit from the Neufeld Levin family archives will also be presented at the conference. Anne Frederika Neufeld-Levin and her family escaped from Austria and immigrated to the United States in 1939. In 1996, she donated the Neufeld Family Archive to the UC Santa Cruz Library's Special Collections and established the Neufeld Levin Endowed Chair in Holocaust Studies at the campus. </p><p> 	For more information, visit the conference web site at</p><p><a href="http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/conferences.html">http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/conferences.html</a></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914cd0768072704601a012ff2aea3f10"><name>334</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>EDITOR'S ADVISORY: Policy brief examines reforms to global financial system</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1051513200000</start-date><display-name>EDITOR'S ADVISORY: Policy brief...</display-name><path>/2003/04/334</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/04/334</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337984576</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337984576</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A leading economist argues that proposed reforms to the global financial system, drafted in the wake of financial crises that shook the world economy during the 1990s, would fail the test of markets and politics. Current proposals focus on reducing the probability of a crisis and helping bring about the swift resolution of any that should occur. Such strategies, although worthwhile, are insufficient, says Joshua Aizenman, who calls for pragmatic solutions that build on politically and financially proven institutions, including:</p><p><table BGCOLOR="#FFCC33" align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="3" valign="TOP" width="50%"><tr><td><b><font color="#333333">Economist available to assist reporters with coverage of proposed reforms</font></b></td></tr></table>. a more stringent application of capital and reserve requirements;</p><p>. coordination of regulations across countries by the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund;</p><p>. coordination among creditors, and the formation of international bankruptcy procedures.</p><p>	Aizenman's analysis, "Reforming the Global Financial System," is online at <a href="http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgirs/gpb/">repositories.cdlib.org/cgirs/gpb</a>. The policy brief is the second in a series published by the Center for Global, International, and Regional Studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><p>	Aizenman, a professor of economics at UCSC, specializes in international finance and development. He is at the forefront of discussions of ways to modify the global financial system to alleviate financial crises around the world.

A first step in the process would be to formulate a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two institutions. The MOU would have to be reviewed by appropriate state officials to secure state enrollment funding, and would be subject to approval by the Institute's Board of Trustees and the UC Board of Regents. Approval of the MOU would lead to the development of an implementation plan.<br/>
<br/>
<p>If the Institute does become part of the University of California, it would be administered as a unit of UC Santa Cruz, although its expertise and resources would be available systemwide.</p>
<p>The Monterey Institute of International Studies was established in 1955 and offers graduate programs in international policy studies, translation and interpretation, language teaching, and international business. Approximately one-half of the Institute's 700 students come from outside the United States. Students must be proficient in at least one non-native language prior to admission to the Institute.</p>
<p>"The Institute has a unique and distinguished history in serving the nation's need for graduates with a wide-ranging perspective on issues that transcend national boundaries," said University of California President Richard C. Atkinson. "The University of California is pleased to explore this possibility as a means of enhancing its abilities to serve the State of California and the nation," he added.</p>
<p>"I couldn't be more pleased. Becoming part of the world's greatest public research university would provide the Institute tremendous opportunities to build on and leverage its expertise and academic resources," said Institute President Chester D. Haskell. "At the same time, I believe the Monterey Institute can enhance the academic and research efforts of the university, particularly in concert with our neighbor, the University of California, Santa Cruz, " he added.</p>
<p>"California's future is increasingly global, and a bringing together of the Monterey Institute and the University of California would greatly benefit the people of California," said M. R. C. Greenwood, chancellor of UC Santa Cruz. "The Institute would bring unique expertise to the university and its students and greatly increase the research capabilities of both institutions," she added.</p>
<p>The Monterey Institute includes the Graduate School of International Policy Studies, the Graduate School of Translation and Interpretation, the Fisher Graduate School of International Business and the Graduate School of Language and Educational Linguistics. The Institute also includes the internationally renowned Center for Nonproliferation Studies, Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies and Center for East Asian Studies.</p>
<p>The Institute is located in downtown Monterey, California.</p>

A team of astronomers has used light from a powerful quasar to analyze the composition of a young galaxy in unprecedented detail, measuring elements never before detected in such a far-off galaxy.</p><p><table BGCOLOR="#FFCC33" align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="3" valign="TOP" width="50%"><tr><td><b><font color="#333333">EMBARGOED: Not for release until 2 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 30</font></b></td></tr></table>"I never thought we'd find one where we could measure boron, tin, and lead," said Jason X. Prochaska, the University of California, Santa Cruz, astronomer who led the project. "This opens up a whole new area of research."</p><p>The technique only works for very distant galaxies that happen to be in the line of sight between Earth and a quasar, said Prochaska, an assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics. </p><p>"The quasar provides a little window where we can do this observation," he said.</p><p>Prochaska and his collaborators, J. Christopher Howk and Arthur M. Wolfe of UC San Diego, report in the May 1 issue of the journal Nature that galaxies in this window provide valuable clues about nucleosynthesis, the process by which elements form.</p><p>By determining the relative amounts of elements in different cosmic objects, astronomers learn about how various astrophysical processes stock the periodic table. Only the lightest elements--hydrogen, helium, and lithium--are thought to have formed in the first moments after the Big Bang. Other elements come together inside stars, where extreme heat and density encourage lighter elements to fuse together. </p><p>Stars produce different elements at different stages of their life cycles. When stars burst into supernovae, the explosions forge still more elements. Supernovae spew out newly formed elements as interstellar gas, which eventually condenses into new stars and planets. Other processes, such as the action of cosmic rays, account for further nucleosynthesis.</p><p>Most information on nucleosynthesis to date has come from studies of stars in our home galaxy, the Milky Way, and a handful of other nearby galaxies. Each element absorbs and gives off light at a certain wavelength. By analyzing the intensity of light coming from stars at specific wavelengths, astronomers can determine the relative amounts of the elements they contain. In this traditional approach, the star both emits and absorbs the light that astronomers analyze.</p><p>An alternative technique uses the absorption of light by interstellar gas to measure elemental abundances in the gas that fills the Milky Way and other galaxies. For example, analyzing the light from a bright star in the Milky Way reveals absorption signatures that tell astronomers about the composition of the gas between the star and the Earth.</p><p>This technique can be used on other galaxies by identifying a distant quasar that lies behind the galaxy. Quasars are extremely bright objects astronomers think are related to massive black holes. The technique has been applied to the Milky Way and its nearest neighbors, but the observations are difficult because the majority of the absorption signatures lie at ultraviolet wavelengths. Earth's atmosphere filters out ultraviolet light, so the observations require expensive space-based telescopes.</p><p>Ironically, this technique is more easily carried out on very distant galaxies. That's because the expansion of the universe causes galaxies to move further apart so fast that the light they emit is shifted toward longer wavelengths. Galaxies that are extremely far away--say, 10 billion light-years--are moving at such a pace that the absorption signatures from their elements are shifted out of the ultraviolet and into the visible range. By analyzing the signature of an intervening galaxy on light from a distant quasar, astronomers gain vital information on galaxies that are generally too faint to observe directly.</p><p>In the Nature paper, Prochaska and his coauthors describe a young galaxy in which they were able to study the signatures of many different elements. The galaxy is so far away that the light from it has taken billions of years to reach Earth, thereby giving the astronomers a glimpse back in time.</p><p>Prochaska's group first found the galaxy by identifying a characteristic dip in the quasar signal caused by hydrogen gas in the galaxy. The researchers then looked for the signatures caused by other elements. By measuring the dips in light intensities at the corresponding wavelengths, they determined the relative amounts of 25 different elements in the galaxy. Previous observations of such distant galaxies have yielded information on only a handful of elements.</p><p>"Many of the additional elements give us new information on how stars are forming, how elements form, and the age of the galaxy," Prochaska said. "Each of those is a key area of astrophysics, so to be able to do all three is particularly exciting."</p><p>Scientists constantly look for new astronomical data to confirm or refine their models for how nucleosynthesis occurs. In this galaxy, the ratios of elements to each other is similar to that in our own galaxy, which Prochaska said was comforting because "it appears there is nothing too weird going on here." The differences between the two galaxies are also instructive, putting the age of the young galaxy at about one to two billion years, compared with the 10-billion-year-old Milky Way.</p><p>The researchers hope to study many more galaxies in the same way. They have already found another promising galaxy along the same sight line as the one described in the paper.</p><p>"What is exciting is that this discovery suggests we can repeat the analysis for 100 other galaxies," Prochaska said. "That's 100 different galaxies walking down unique paths for the formation of the elements."</p><p>The researchers made their observations at the W. M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The initial observations were made with the Echellette Spectrograph Imager on the Keck II Telescope, and follow-up observations with the High Resolution Echelle Spectrograph (HIRES) on the Keck I Telescope. </p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Prochaska at (831) 459-2135 or xavier@ucolick.org.

Keck Observatory from April 26 to May 2 and can be reached there at (808) 885-7887.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914cd3fe8072704601a012ff6725467a"><name>337</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Public chemistry lecture at UC Santa Cruz features Nobel laureate Herbert C.

Brown will give the third annual Joseph F. Bunnett Research Organic Chemistry Lecture at 4 p.m. on Friday, May 2, in the University Center at UC Santa Cruz. Brown's talk, entitled "The Discovery and Exploration of a New Continent of Organic Chemistry," is free and open to the public. </p><p>The R. B. Wetherill Research Professor Emeritus of chemistry at Purdue University, Brown is most famous for his pioneering work with boron compounds, which revolutionized synthetic organic chemistry. </p><p>While working for the Department of Defense during World War II, Brown found a way to make sodium borohydride. This compound opened a new path for making hydrogen gas, used in weather balloons during the war and in fuel cells today. This was the first of many important reactions made possible by boranes, compounds of boron and hydrogen.</p><p>Boranes, which Brown has called "possibly the most useful intermediates currently available," are now used in the synthesis of many organic compounds, including medications such as the antidepressant Prozac and the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor.</p><p>In 1979, Brown shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with German chemist Georg Wittig of the University of Heidelberg. He has received many other medals, honorary doctorates, and fellowships in recognition of his work. </p><p>Brown received his B.S. and Ph.D. at the University of Chicago. He taught there and at Wayne State University before transferring to Purdue University, where he has remained since 1947.</p><p>Brown's lecture will be followed by a reception with locally produced food and wine at 5 p.m. Posters at the reception will feature ongoing research in chemistry at UCSC. </p><p>The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry hosts the Bunnett lecture series, which honors Professor Emeritus Joseph Bunnett. The series is supported by an endowment fund of private contributions.</p><p>Bunnett is famous both for his work in organic chemistry and for his dedication to the destruction of chemical weapons. He chaired the Committee on Chemical Weapons Destruction Technologies of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, and has served on committees of the National Research Council, the Department of Defense, and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. He also cochaired the peer review committee of the Russian-American Joint Evaluation Program, which assisted Russia in destroying its chemical munitions.</p><p>Bunnett's research interests include kinetics, equilibria, and mechanisms of organic reactions. He has won a Guggenheim and two Fulbright fellowships, and has served as a visiting lecturer at universities on five continents.</p><p>For more information about the lecture, contact April Barrett at (831) 459-4002 or barrett@chemistry.ucsc.edu, or visit the web site at <a href="http://chemistry.ucsc.edu/alumni/events.html">http://chemistry.ucsc.edu/alumni/events.html</a>. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914cd5528072704601a012ffe977cb7f"><name>338</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Peregrine falcons take flight at Long Marine Lab</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1049958000000</start-date><display-name>Peregrine falcons take flight...</display-name><path>/2003/04/338</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/04/338</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337985807</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337985807</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Three young peregrine falcons are testing their wings this week at Long Marine Laboratory, a research facility of the University of California, Santa Cruz. The falcons were raised in captivity and are being released to the wild by the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group (SCPBRG), which is affiliated with UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences and based at Long Marine Lab.</p><p>Glenn Stewart, SCPBRG program manager, said the birds may remain in the area of the laboratory for a month or longer, taking food provided by the researchers, while they develop their flying and hunting skills. Visitors to the lab's Seymour Marine Discovery Center will be able to see the falcons during this time, although it is hard to predict how much time the birds will spend near the release site, Stewart said.</p><p>"In the wild, it takes about a month for them to learn to hunt for themselves and become independent from their parents," he said.</p><p>The three falcons, all males, are being released using the same methods that SCPBRG biologists have used since the 1970s to help bring the peregrine falcon back from the brink of extinction. The group has released more than 950 peregrine falcons into the wild, mostly in California. These are the first to be released at Long Marine Lab.</p><p>"We use a release method known as 'hacking,' after an old falconry method for getting young birds in shape before taking them up for hunting. The difference is that we are returning them to the wild," Stewart said.</p><p>(A detailed description of hacking can be found on the SCPBRG web site at <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/scpbrg/hacksite.htm">http://www2.ucsc.edu/scpbrg/hacksite.htm</a>.)</p><p>The release at Long Marine Lab was planned as mitigation for the disturbance of a nesting pair of wild peregrines during seismic retrofitting work on the San Francisco Bay Bridge. Caltrans contracted with SCPBRG to carry out the release, which was required under state and federal wildlife regulations.</p><p>The young falcons were hatched by captive parents and raised in a large aviary with minimal human contact to prevent tameness toward people. When they were five weeks old, they were transferred to the release site, called a "hack box," set up on a third-floor landing of the Center for Ocean Health building at Long Marine Lab. The box, with a gravel-covered ledge, is similar to a natural eyrie. It has a hatch where food can be dropped in surreptitiously, so the birds aren't aware that they are being fed by people and don't become tame. </p><p>The falcons were held in the hack box for about a week while their flight feathers grew in. This morning (Thursday, April 10), Stewart slid back the bars that covered the front of the hack box, giving the birds their first opportunity to try their wings. They could take their first flights anytime in the next few days, Stewart said. A supply of fresh quail ensures that the birds will continue to associate the hack box with food as they explore their surroundings.</p><p>"They usually return to the box daily for up to six weeks for food that we secretly provide in the box," Stewart said. "My hope is that for several weeks they will be perching on rooftops and generally dominating the airspace around the lab, where people can watch and enjoy them."</p><p>It is possible that one or more of the birds will leave the area after just a few days. They might also spend most of their time out of sight, only appearing once a day for 30 seconds or so while they grab some food. </p><p>"It's very unpredictable how much time they will spend at the front of the box," Stewart said.</p><p>When SCPBRG began its work in 1975, only two nesting pairs of peregrine falcons remained in California. Peregrine populations throughout North America had been decimated by the pesticide DDT, which caused the birds to lay thin-shelled eggs that broke or dried out. In 1999, when the peregrine falcon was removed from the endangered species list, the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service gave the SCPBRG an award in recognition of its "pioneering efforts" to restore wild peregrine populations.</p><p>The group is currently engaged in a survey to quantify the current population of peregrine falcons in California. The researchers estimate that there are more than 250 breeding pairs in the state, but the last comprehensive survey was done in 1992. </p><p>"We used to be able to observe every nesting site, but there are so many now that we don't have the staff to keep track of them all," Stewart said.</p><p>The group has been recruiting a large network of volunteers throughout the state to provide information about nesting pairs of peregrine falcons.

They are Francisco Hernandez, vice chancellor for student affairs, and Frank Talamantes and Martha ZÃºÃ±iga, both professors of molecular, cell and developmental biology.</p>
<p>The magazine published its fifth annual survey of the country's most powerful Hispanics in business and technology in the May issue. More than 100 Hispanic men and women were chosen based on their "progressive leadership responsibilities, achievements in helping to advance access to technology, demonstrated effectiveness in engaging technology within the global market economy, and their contributions to furthering technical literacy within the Hispanic community."</p>
<p>Hernandez has served as vice chancellor for student affairs since 1994, with responsibility for the quality of student life through residential life programs, student services, and enrollment services. He is the executive director of the UC College Prep Initiative, a UC program that offers online AP courses to underrepresented high school students in the state of California.</p>
<p>Talamantes, a prominent endocrinologist, serves as vice provost and dean of graduate studies. He has received numerous awards and honors for his pioneering research on hormones and hormone receptors. He is a past president of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), and his leadership on issues of minority education has earned him several awards. In 1998, he was selected as one of the "100 most influential Hispanics" by Hispanic Business magazine.</p>
<p>ZÃºÃ±iga is an immunologist whose research focuses on the molecules that enable the immune system to distinguish "self" from "non-self." She is a member of the Minority Affairs Committee of the American Society for Cell Biology and a past board member of SACNAS. ZÃºÃ±iga is also a faculty mentor for several programs that involve students in research activities both in the U.S. and abroad. She was among ten Hispanic scientists featured in an exhibit at the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose as part of National Hispanic Heritage Month in 2000.</p>

The UCCP was established three years ago to increase opportunities for students from school districts that have "underdeveloped college preparatory curricula." </p><p>	 With funding from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the North American Council for Online Learning (NACOL) was formed in response to the growth in online K-12 learning and teaching initiatives. NACOL, in collaboration with the Western Cooperative for Educational Telecommunications (WCET), will focus on providing high-quality online teaching and will support expanded research in the field.</p><p>Hernandez is among the pioneers of online K-12 education selected to join the board of directors, which met April 15-16 to develop a strategic plan and begin the process of hiring an executive director.</p><p>"NACOL will provide a national forum for online learning, and I am pleased to participate," said Hernandez, who developed UCCP to "level the playing field" for students from high schools that offer few, if any, AP courses. UCCP uses a combination of Internet, CD-ROM technology, and textbooks to offer its courses.</p><p>UCCP this year broadened its services to offer AP exam review in 14 subject areas and free online SAT and ACT test preparation to all California students. UCCP also supports teachers by hosting online teaching and learning institutes in the summer. </p><p>	</p><p>"It makes sense for the university to invest in today's high school students. They are tomorrow's university students," said Hernandez. "The university has the expertise to help develop virtual schooling. Our faculty and staff are involved with the development, delivery, and evaluation of online learning. It's a smart partnership."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a27f96778072704601a012ff44cc6a1b"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2003/04/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/04/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626524754</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626524754</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a27f96778072704601a012ff44cc6a1b"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2003/04/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/04/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626524754</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626524754</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
