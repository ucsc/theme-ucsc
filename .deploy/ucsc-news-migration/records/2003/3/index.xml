Iridescent males erupt in flights to heights of 75 to 150 feet, pause, and then swoop down over the heads of attractive females, pulling up at the last split second with a sharp popping squeak. Some observers believe the sound is caused by air trapped under the male's tail feathers, while others believe it is a vocal call. Whatever the cause, the sound is distinct and impressive, especially considering its source--a tiny Anna's hummingbird that zips past in a blur of color.</p><p>A large population of Anna's hummingbirds lives year-round in the Arboretum, so visitors are practically guaranteed to see this mating display on Hummingbird Day. Careful observers walking the grounds might even spot a tiny nest tucked into the fork of a branch along the Hummingbird Trail. The hummingbirds are out in all but the worst weather, even in light rain. There is more activity than usual in March, when some of the migratory hummers join the resident Anna's hummingbirds.</p><p>Hummingbird Day will feature special programs for adults and children, including tours of the garden, slide shows, an art show, and children's crafts and stories (see schedule below). Hummingbird tours will be led by David Suddjian, wildlife biologist and leader of the annual Santa Cruz County Christmas bird count, and Tonya Haff, curator of UCSC's Natural History Museum. Stephen McCabe, coordinator of research and education at the Arboretum, will lead a tour on the Hummingbird Trail highlighting plants that attract hummingbirds.</p><p>Visitors will find lots of information on how to make their gardens hummingbird friendly. Before you sweep off the cobwebs from roof eaves, for instance, remember that spider webs are a prime nesting material for hummingbirds; they keep the tiny nests strong and warm. Many other interesting facts about these amazing birds will be presented during Hummingbird Day. Plants, books, and other resources will be available for purchase.</p><p>This year, for the first time, the event will include an art show: "Hummingbirds and Their World," featuring art and illustrations selected by Ann Caudle, coordinator of UCSC's Science Illustration Program, and Arboretum director Dan Harder. The virtuosity and imagination of the artists will inform and delight viewers of all ages. This exhibit will be held in the Horticulture II Building from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday (except during the 10 to 11:30 a.m. and 1 to 2:30 p.m. programs on Saturday).</p><p>The Arboretum is located off Empire Grade (the continuation of High Street) between the east and west entrances to the UCSC campus. Regular hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day. </p><p></p><p>Hummingbird Day Schedule</p><p>Saturday, March 15</p><p>10 to 11:30 a.m.  Hummingbird program, slide show, and tour by David Suddjian.

<p><strong>Why:</strong> This decision will enable the university to achieve multiple benefits, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Closer alignment with the values and mission of the university and with the expectations of students.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>The opportunity for the dining services workforce to be integrated into UC employment status.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>The opportunity for the campus to examine and shape the dining services program as it proceeds to build-out goals.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> The university is currently contracted with Sodexho through June 2004. Sodexho has served as a partner with the university for many years. This partnership has benefited the campus community and has enabled the dining services program to develop into one of the finest in the UC system. Sodexho has made substantial contributions to UC Santa Cruz and will continue to lend assistance as a partner in the transition process.</p>
<p>The university will now begin to develop a transition plan, which will include a business plan to support the transition. More details on this transition plan are expected to be announced in the beginning weeks of spring quarter 2003, in April.</p>
<p><strong>For more information:</strong> Jean Marie Scott, associate vice chancellor for Colleges and University Housing Services (CUHS), and Alma Sifuentes, director of Residential and Dining Services for CUHS, are available for questions. To arrange an interview, please contact UCSC's Public Information Office (831/459-2495).</p>

<p>The new video <em>Gender and Relationships: Male-Female Differences in Love and Marriage</em> illuminates the roots of "gendered" patterns of communication and interaction that challenge many adults in intimate relationships. Produced by sociologist Dane Archer, an expert on gender and communication at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Gender and Relationships helps demystify the differences between men and women in ways that resonate with viewers of all ages.</p>
<p>"There is no one path to attraction, courtship, love, and marriage, and the difficulties can leave you wondering if men and women have the same needs, hopes, and dreams," said Archer, who deftly highlights factors that contribute to the gender gap in relationships, beginning with a study showing how differently adults interact with a baby they think is a boy than with a baby they think is a girl.</p>
<p>The latest in Archer's series of bestselling educational videotapes on nonverbal</p>
<p>communication, cultural differences, and gender, Gender and Relationships combines personal testimonials with the insights of trained professionals to help instructors reach students in ways that will make them think critically about gender, attraction, relationships, and marriage.</p>

<ul li="">
<li style="list-style: none">Imagine, for example, having the opportunity to share one relationship insight with one million members of the opposite sex. Archer, who asked both men and women for their ideas, found remarkable consensus among women, who urged men to "Listen--just listen" without trying to "solve the problem." Men, by contrast, pleaded with women to communicate directly with them and to make their conversational needs explicit.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Consider the insights of children of divorce, who, when asked about their own prospects of living "happily ever after," recalled the conflict in their parents' marriage and expressed grave doubts about the likelihood they would find happiness in a long-lasting love relationship.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Hear from gays and lesbians about the rights and privileges same-sex couples are denied.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Gender and Relationships presents compelling testimony from men and women of varied cultural and social backgrounds who discuss gender differences in love, courtship, "couplehood," marriage, emotions, and understanding.</p>
<p>With sensitivity and humor, Archer lets real people describe the hurdles and triumphs on the road to love. Their candid testimonials unmask gender roles and sex-role socialization more poignantly than any lecture could, revealing the pitfalls of conventional wisdom about gender. Gender and Relationships reveals the gulf of misperception, misunderstanding, and heartbreak that can separate women and men even when they are involved in the most intimate and important relationships of their lives.</p>

Faulkner's talk, which will take place on April 10, will be the last in a series of five annual lectures established by the RAS to honor Tayler after his death in 1997.</p><p>Tayler was a highly distinguished physicist and astronomer who did pioneering work in several areas of research. He served the RAS for many years, first as secretary, then as treasurer, and finally as president. He was also the managing editor of the society's major journal for 20 years. </p><p>Faulkner worked with Tayler at Cambridge University when Faulkner was a graduate student of Fred Hoyle, another giant in the field of astronomy. At the time, Hoyle had so many graduate students working with him that he decided he needed another senior researcher to help guide them, Faulkner said.</p><p>"[Hoyle] brought Tayler back to Cambridge to help mentor this large group of graduate students, and he was very good at that," Faulkner said. "He was really a delightful guy and he did some very important work in those early days. Later he became a much loved president of the Royal Astronomical Society. So I really felt honored to receive the invitation to give the final lecture in this series."</p><p>The National Astronomy Meeting at which Faulkner will give the lecture brings together all of the major astronomy organizations of the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic. The title of Faulkner's lecture is "Standing on the Shoulders of Dwarfs," a sly twist on one of Isaac Newton's most famous remarks that Faulkner has used to describe his work on the structure and evolution of stars. </p><p>Stellar evolution is an area in which both Tayler and Faulkner made significant contributions, and it continues to be the primary focus of Faulkner's research. In 1966, Faulkner published a landmark paper explaining a key phase in the life of stars like the Sun, which are known to astronomers as red dwarfs. His most recent work not only explains another key phase of stellar evolution (the "red giant" phase), but also provides a unifying viewpoint that links all three major stages in the evolution of stars like the Sun.</p><p>The Sun is currently in the first of these major stages, the "main sequence" phase, which accounts for about 90 percent of the life of a star. When a main sequence star starts to exhaust the hydrogen fuel in its core, the core begins to condense while the outer portions of the star expand. It then becomes an extremely large "red giant," with a very dense core and a large outer envelope. Eventually, the core becomes hot enough to burn helium and the star enters the "horizontal branch" phase, the third major stage in its evolution. Finally, most of the outer portions of the star are blown off and it becomes a "white dwarf."</p><p>Faulkner's 1966 paper explored computationally the strange structure of stars in the horizontal branch phase, with their double energy source of helium and hydrogen. His new work explains analytically why stars become red giants, and also sheds new light on the other two main stages in the evolution of stars like the Sun.</p><p>"Not only does the red giant build on the previous red dwarf stage, but what is developing in the interior of the red giant is like a white dwarf, the obvious precursor of the bare white dwarf it will ultimately become," Faulkner said. </p><p>The Sun is about half way through the main sequence phase of its evolution. It will remain essentially unchanged for another 5 billion years or so before it swells up to become a red giant 150 to 200 times its current size.</p><p>"A red giant is like a white dwarf with a storage problem. And, as many of us might consider doing when faced with this problem, it remodels the attic. That's why and how it gets that big," Faulkner said.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Faulkner at (831) 459-2815 or johnf@ucolick.org.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914cbc3e8072704601a012ffc57f0597"><name>316</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC researcher will describe scientific voyages to Antarctica in a public talk at the Seymour Center on Wednesday, March 12</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1046761200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC researcher will describe...</display-name><path>/2003/03/316</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/03/316</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337979386</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337979386</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As chief scientist aboard the research vessel Laurence M. Gould, Daniel Costa led a research team investigating the ecology of the Southern Ocean around Antarctica on two cruises in 2001 and 2002. Costa, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, will share his experiences conducting research during the harsh Antarctic winter, along with breathtaking photos he took along the way, in a public lecture and slide show at Long Marine Laboratory.</p><p>The lecture will take place at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center on Wednesday, March 12, from 7 to 8:30 p.m. Admission is $6 for the general public and $4 for members of the Friends of Long Marine Lab. </p><p>The biologically productive waters off Antarctica support trillions of shrimplike crustaceans called krill that play a central role in the ecology of the Southern Ocean. Animals that feed on krill include commercially important fish, seals, whales, penguins, and other seabirds. How the krill and their predators survive the long, cold polar winter is one of the questions the researchers on the Laurence M. Gould set out to answer.</p><p>The cruises were part of the Southern Ocean component of the Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics survey (SO GLOBEC), which is part of a wider international GLOBEC program funded in the United States by the National Science Foundation. The program was set up to study how marine life is affected by environmental change. Costa serves on the executive committee of the SO GLOBEC program, in addition to his role as chief scientist on the two cruises.</p><p>Because so many top predators concentrate on krill as their primary food source, scientists have been concerned about the vulnerability of the Southern Ocean ecosystem to environmental perturbations, such as climate change, Costa said. </p><p>"One of our main goals is to understand the role of climate in driving the ecosystem of the Southern Ocean," he said. "We'd like to know, for example, what factors determine the number of krill that survive the winter." </p><p>The program's field studies involved two research vessels, the Laurence M. Gould and the Nathaniel B. Palmer. As chief scientist of the Laurence M. Gould, Costa was responsible for coordinating the work of a diverse group of researchers, while conducting his own research on crabeater seals. </p><p>Despite their name, crabeater seals eat mainly the shrimplike krill. They have evolved elaborately shaped interlocking teeth that they use to filter krill from the water. Although they are probably the most numerous seals in the world, crabeater seals have been difficult to study because of their remote habitat. </p><p>To follow the movements of crabeater seals and study their feeding behavior, Costa used electronic tags that transmitted signals to the researchers via satellite. Satellite tags were also used to study the movements of Adélie penguins. </p><p>Other researchers on the cruise focused on whales, krill, the algae that live in sea ice, and various aspects of the physical environment. An unexpected finding from the 2001 field studies was the occurrence of "hot spots," areas of abundant Antarctic krill where predators such as minke whales, humpback whales, seals, and penguins were also found in large numbers.</p><p>Conducting field studies in the Antarctic winter was hard work, but the researchers also found time to have fun, Costa said. In his talk at the Seymour Center, Costa will try to convey a sense of what life was like on the cruises, while presenting some of the scientific findings to come out of the SO GLOBEC program.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914cbd778072704601a012ff19845713"><name>317</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Chef and cookbook author to establish cooking resource at UCSC</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1047366000000</start-date><display-name>Chef and cookbook author...</display-name><path>/2003/03/317</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/03/317</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337979694</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337979694</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Renowned chef and cookbook author Bruce Aidells has pledged a $20,000 gift to establish a cookery endowment at UC Santa Cruz.</p><p><table BGCOLOR="#FFCC33" align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="3" valign="TOP" width="50%"><tr><td><b><font color="#333333">Bruce Aidells earned a Ph.D. in biology from UCSC.</font></b></td></tr></table>Aidells is the author of 11 cookbooks, including the meat and poultry chapters for the newly revised Joy of Cooking. He has also been a guest chef on a wide variety of television shows such as Martin Yan's Yan Can Cook, Martha Stewart's From Martha's Kitchen, and Cooking Live with Sarah Molton. </p><p>	"I'm interested in making this endowment so future generations have access to information about how to cook, since that information is no longer being passed down from mother to daughter, or mother to son," Aidells said. "I want to do as much as I can so that we don't produce a generation of students who depend on corporations to put a hot meal on the table."</p><p>	Aidells hopes to counter the corporate promotion of highly processed foods with a complete range of educational materials that promote the values and various techniques of home cooking with high-quality fresh foods. The goal is to give students a lifelong appreciation for good food, plus an awareness of the role that raising, preparing, and sharing food plays in creating community across the world.</p><p>	An alumnus of UC Santa Cruz, Aidells earned a Ph.D. in biology in 1974. He worked as a research fellow at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London for three years, before heading off to a two-year stint with the National Institute of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Though he found the English intellectual approach to science appealing, he soon gave up science for a career in the kitchen.</p><p>	"I made a lifestyle decision that it was more important for me to remain in the Bay Area than find a job in science in an area of the country where I didn't want to live," Aidells said.  "And I always thought I was a better cook than I was a scientist," he added.</p><p>	Aidells had briefly tasted the life of a restaurateur during his student days at UC Santa Cruz. An amateur cook in his spare time, he had been given the opportunity to design and build his own small restaurant on campus in the early 1970s, during the planning stages of what is now Kresge College.</p><p>  	"It was called Fat Alberts Rotunda, named after the cover of a Herbie Hancock album," Aidells recalled. "I was officially a graduate student. But I had to give up my restaurant when my graduate adviser said he hadn't seen me in the lab in six months."</p><p>	He went on to create Aidells Sausage Company in 1983, providing his own handcrafted sausages to chef friends at some of the Bay Area's top restaurants. The business was wildly successful, and he became a familiar figure in the cooking world.</p><p>Aidells has since made more than 30 appearances on Bay Area television, and has appeared with wife Nancy Oakes (chef and co-owner of Boulevard Restaurant in San Francisco and the James Beard Foundation's 2001 "Best Chef in California") on shows such as PBS's Rising Star Chefs and the Food Channel's TV News. He is additionally a regular contributor to national magazines such as Gourmet, Bon Appetit, Fine Cooking, and Cooking Light.	</p><p>	Aidells said he was currently working on a new cookbook about pork, which will be published by HarperCollins in 2005. He spends his time now writing books, testing recipes, and teaching cooking classes. Aidells recently traveled to Texas for one such course.</p><p>	"I like the fact that a guy from Berkeley, CA, goes to Texas to teach a bunch of Texans how to cook meat," he observed wryly.</p><p>The UC Santa Cruz endowment income will be used to create and maintain a core collection of books, periodicals, audiovisual materials, personal papers, and archives at the University Library on the subjects of cooking, eating, and gastronomy. Aidells has also agreed to provide content for an online cooking site which would be linked to the library's home page, and aimed at teaching students how to stock a kitchen and prepare food. Eventual plans may include cooking classes held at the organic farm on campus, as well as lectures, food demonstrations, and even a café.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914cbf038072704601a012ff7cc22a18"><name>318</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>EDITOR'S ADVISORY: UCSC experts available to discuss U.S.-Iraqi crisis and related topics</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Iraq experts, experts on Iraq war</keywords><start-date>1047884400000</start-date><display-name>EDITOR'S ADVISORY: UCSC experts...</display-name><path>/2003/03/318</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/03/318</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337980112</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337980112</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The following experts are available to discuss the U.S.-Iraqi crisis and related topics.

Sloan Foundation has selected Todd Lowe, an assistant professor of computer engineering at UC Santa Cruz, to receive a Sloan Research Fellowship in molecular biology. Lowe, whose research combines computational and experimental approaches to uncover new biology, is among 117 young scientists and economists to receive the prestigious fellowships this year. Lowe is investigating, among other things, the exotic biology and uncharted genetics of microorganisms that thrive at boiling temperatures. </p><p>The Sloan Research Fellowships are intended to enhance the careers of the very best young faculty members in seven specified fields of science. They include a grant of $40,000 that provides flexible and largely unrestricted support for research. </p><p>Lowe joined the UCSC faculty in 2001 as the first hire for a new interdisciplinary Department of Biomolecular Engineering that is being formed in the Baskin School of Engineering. He also holds a courtesy appointment in the campus's Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology, and is affiliated with the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering directed by David Haussler, who holds a UC Presidential Chair in computer science and is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.</p><p>Haussler, who nominated Lowe for the Sloan fellowship, called him "one of a very small, unique group of researchers today who effectively combines computational biology and serious experimental molecular biology."</p><p>"One of the key reasons we were so excited for him to join our faculty is the intellectual and collaborative bridge he provides between his more theoretically oriented peers in the School of Engineering, and the biology and chemistry faculty where his experimental lab is physically located," Haussler said.</p><p>A major aim of Lowe's lab is to test the theoretical predictions derived from computational analysis of genome sequences, using experimental techniques to get results that traditional biologists would consider convincing.</p><p>"We are swimming in theoretical gene predictions of highly variable quality and reliability," Lowe said. "We need to use high-throughput methods such as DNA microarrays to test and refine theoretical gene function predictions." </p><p>Lowe earned a B.A. in biology, with a concentration in computer science, at Williams College in Williamstown, MA, then worked as a computer specialist at the National Center for Biotechnology Information before entering graduate school. He earned a Ph.D. in molecular genetics from the University of Washington in St. Louis, where he worked with geneticist Sean Eddy. Lowe was then a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of geneticist David Botstein at Stanford University before coming to UCSC. </p><p>Lowe's current research makes use of DNA microarrays ("gene chips"), which can provide a comprehensive view of gene activity in cells, revealing which genes are turned on and off in response to different conditions. Lowe uses microarrays to predict functional roles for unstudied genes, to study how cells respond to stresses, and to understand how gene activity is controlled. </p><p>Much of his work has focused on a group of microorganisms called Archaea, which look much like bacteria but are genetically and biochemically quite distinct. Archaea live in some of the most extreme environments on Earth, including hot springs, thermal vents in the deep sea, and highly acidic or alkaline water. Lowe plans to compare gene activity in two distantly related species of "hyperthermophilic" Archaea to identify the genes and biological pathways that enable them to thrive at extremely high temperatures.</p><p>Another major focus in Lowe's lab is the investigation of so-called "noncoding RNAs," which are not involved directly in protein synthesis as are most other RNA molecules. Using both computational and experimental approaches, he is developing techniques for rapidly identifying the functions of newly discovered noncoding RNAs. </p><p>The Sloan Research Fellowship Program is one of the oldest fellowship programs in the country. It began in 1955 as a means of encouraging research by young scholars at a critical time in their careers when other support is difficult to obtain. More than 500 nominations for the 2003 awards were reviewed by a committee of distinguished scientists. </p><p>The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, a philanthropic nonprofit institution, was established in 1934 by Alfred P. Sloan Jr., then president and chief executive officer of the General Motors Corporation.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Lowe at (831) 459-1511 or lowe@soe.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914cc1658072704601a012ff6c6b5163"><name>320</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC to present Pacific Rim Festival April 2-30 featuring works of over 40 distinguished composers</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1048143600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC to present Pacific...</display-name><path>/2003/03/320</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/03/320</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337980721</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337980721</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz will present the work of more than 40 distinguished composers April 2-30 at the 2003 Pacific Rim Music Festival, a month-long international celebration of the contemporary music of the Pacific Rim. </p><p> The festival will include 12 performances of seven different programs that will take place at the Music Center Recital Hall on the UC Santa Cruz campus, as well as at San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center, the Julia Morgan Theatre in Berkeley, and the Mondavi Center at UC Davis.</p><p> It will additionally feature lectures and symposia spotlighting the rich traditions and new musical directions emanating from the countries that make up the Pacific Rim. </p><p>The festival kicks off on April 2 with a celebration of the 80th birthday of renowned Chinese composer Chou Wen-Chung, featuring a performance of his composition Windswept Peaks. The concert will also include works by his colleagues, friends, and students--including Edgard Varese, Isang Yun, Joji Yuasa, Chinary Ung, and Hi Kyung Kim--performed by the New Music Ensemble of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, conducted by Nicole Paiement. </p><p>On April 4, in a program titled "Chou Wen-Chung's Distinguished Disciples," the Empyrean Ensemble of UC Davis will also honor him with works performed by seven of his distinguished student composers, including James Tenney, Bright Sheng, and Chen Yi.  </p><p>Pulitzer-prize winning composer Shulamit Ran will present a pre-lecture talk as a prelude to a dynamic program of works by female composers titled "World Women in Music Today" on April 23 at UC Santa Cruz (also on 4/24 at Yerba Buena and 4/25 at UC Davis). The Parallele Ensemble, conducted by Nicole Paiement, and guest artists Aeri Ji (Korean kayakeum) and Ju-Sun Cho (Korean Pansori singer) will perform works by two of Korea's major composers, Chan-Hae Lee and and Young-Ja Lee. This event, presented in collaboration with the International Women Composers' Festival of Seoul and the Korean Society of Women Composers, will be cohosted by UC Santa Cruz Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood and Korean Consul-General Jong-Hun Kim.</p><p> Fulbright Scholar and UC Santa Cruz music professor Hi Kyung Kim, the artistic director of the festival, said that master percussionist and dancer Eun-Ha Park has just been added to the April 23-25 program. Park is currently a member of the Percussion Ensemble at the National Center for Korean Performing Arts. </p><p>"All of the Korean performers are the best of their generation and are fantastic performers," Kim noted. "And Park is the only woman in Korea who is a master of both dance and drumming," she added. </p><p>Other highlights of the festival include the premiere of Terry Riley's new piece, Tres Cosas Que No Nos Animamos a Hablar on April 9, and an evening of solo piano by acclaimed Canadian recording artist Eve Egoyan as the final event on April 30, in a program titled "Northwest Passages," sponsored by Japan-Canada Fund Commissions. </p><p>Kim noted that the April 23 event will be presented in honor of the Korean Immigration Centennial Celebration, marking the 100th anniversary of Korean immigration to the United States. </p><p>"We would like to show peace through music," Kim said. "It's a very meaningful concert. The ultimate goal that we would like to achieve through this festival is to establish a Pacific Rim Foundation and Korean Music Center at UC Santa Cruz."</p><p>Kim added that the festival will also be dedicated to the memory of composer Lou Harrison, who passed away on February 2.

<p>The counting ability of female coots is part of a sophisticated set of defense mechanisms used to thwart other coots who lay eggs in their neighbors' nests, according to Bruce Lyon, an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Lyon studied hundreds of coot nests in British Columbia during a four-year investigation. His latest findings appear in the April 3 issue of the scientific journal Nature.</p>
<p>"The ability of females to count only their own eggs in a mixture of eggs is a remarkable feat that provides a convincing, rare example of counting in a wild animal," Lyon wrote in the published paper.</p>
<p>A member of the rail family, the American coot (Fulica americana) is a slate-gray bird with a white beak, about the size of a small duck. It inhabits lakes, ponds, and marshes, often in large numbers. Coots are ungainly on land, reluctant to fly, and not very impressive in the water, either. Use of the word coot to mean a stupid person or simpleton reflects prevailing attitudes toward these rather comical birds. But this perception is belied by Lyon's discovery of their impressive cognitive abilities.</p>
<p>"I was shocked. At first, I didn't believe the results," he said.</p>
<p>Lyon originally set out to study how coot parents care for their chicks. But the focus of his research changed when he discovered extremely high levels of "brood parasitism," the practice of laying eggs in other birds' nests. Most studies of brood parasitism have looked at birds like cuckoos, which lay their eggs in other species' nests and thereby avoid the trouble of raising their own chicks. But brood parasitism also occurs within species, and Lyon's research on coots is shedding new light on this little-studied phenomenon.</p>
<p>Lyon and his field assistants tracked the fate of every egg in more than 400 coot nests, checking the nests every day. Because no bird can lay more than one egg per day, parasitism was readily detected. In addition, coot eggs laid by different parents can often be distinguished on the basis of color and speckle pattern.</p>
<p>"The egg pattern is like a fingerprint," Lyon said. "It turns out that in most cases, the parasitism is done by females who have their own nests, and often it's the next-door neighbor, so by comparing the eggs in nearby nests we can tell who's doing it."</p>
<p>Parasitism was rampant, affecting 41 percent of the nests and accounting for 13 percent of all the eggs laid in the study population. Furthermore, the cost of parasitism to the hosts was quite high.</p>
<p>"There's not enough food for all the eggs that get laid, so there is a massive die-off of chicks. Typically about half the chicks in a nest starve to death," Lyon said. "That explains both the cost of parasitism to the host and the benefit to the parasite."</p>
<p>Female coots, Lyon found, are quite good at recognizing and rejecting parasitic eggs. Rejected eggs were buried deep in the nesting material and never hatched. In some cases, parasitic eggs were not rejected outright, but were banished to inferior incubation positions, resulting in delayed hatching and decreased likelihood of survival for the parasitic chicks.</p>
<p>"They may use that strategy to deal with eggs they are less certain of," Lyon said. "It's subtle, but it has an effect on reproductive success, because the ones that hatch later are more likely to perish."</p>
<p>Evidence that coots are able to count their eggs was completely unanticipated. Lyon wanted to look at how the presence of parasitic eggs affected clutch size. Coots are indeterminate layers, meaning that they'll keep laying eggs until an external cue tells them they're done. Speculation about the nature of the cue has long favored the sense of touch--when the female feels like she's sitting on the right number of eggs, the development of new egg follicles stops. (Follicles that have already started developing continue to develop, so there is a delay between the cue and the cessation of egg laying.)</p>
<p>If the birds use a touch cue, the presence of parasitic eggs should cause a female to lay fewer of her own eggs. But Lyon found that when female coots recognized the parasitic eggs in their nests, eventually rejecting them, they did not reduce their clutch size. In contrast, females that failed to recognize parasitic eggs laid one fewer of their own eggs for each parasitic egg they received.</p>
<p>"Rejection takes a long time, so the clutch-size decision is made while the parasitic eggs are still in the nest," Lyon said. "That means they are not using a touch cue. These birds are looking at their nests and counting only those eggs they recognize as their own to make a clutch-size decision."</p>
<p>Lyon noted that the meaning of "counting" in animals is a highly contentious issue among cognitive psychologists and animal behavior experts. What he means by counting is that the birds are making decisions based on the number of eggs in their nests.</p>
<p>"That's pretty amazing for a 'stupid' bird like a coot," Lyon said. "It's very satisfying to rescue a study animal from a bad rap."&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a27f682a8072704601a012ff7d5b6720"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2003/03/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/03/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626512900</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626512900</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a27f682a8072704601a012ff7d5b6720"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2003/03/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/03/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626512900</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626512900</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
