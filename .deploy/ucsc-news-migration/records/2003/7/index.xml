A new study by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, shows that Laysan albatross chicks in nests near the buildings are suffering lead poisoning as a direct result of eating paint chips from the soil in and around their nests.</p>
<p>Previous reports had documented lead poisoning in albatross chicks nesting near buildings on Midway, but the exact source of the lead remained unclear. The UCSC researchers used lead isotope ratios as a tracer to identify the source of the lead in the blood of affected chicks.</p>
<p>"We were able to pinpoint the cause of the lead poisoning. The chicks are eating paint chips directly--it's not from contaminated soil--and knowing that can help guide remediation efforts," said Myra Finkelstein, a graduate student in environmental toxicology and ocean sciences at UCSC.</p>
<p>Finkelstein conducted the study with Donald Smith, professor of environmental toxicology, and Roberto Gwiazda, a research toxicologist. Their findings will appear in the August issue of Environmental Science &amp; Technology and have already been published on the journal's web site.</p>
<p>The lead levels in some albatross chicks on Midway are so high that the toxic metal damages their peripheral nervous systems, leading to a symptom known as "droopwing"--the chicks are unable to hold their wings tucked up against their bodies, and their wings often drag on the ground. It is a classic symptom of lead poisoning, comparable to the "wrist drop" symptom in humans, said Smith.</p>
<p>"If you found this level of lead in a child, the child would be hospitalized immediately," he said.</p>
<p>But Smith noted that the levels of lead in paint samples from Midway are not unusual considering the age of the buildings. "The situation is similar to many neighborhoods with older homes painted with lead-based paint," he said. "What's needed is better lead-hazard control, including building maintenance and clean-up of the site."</p>
<p>Lead-poisoned chicks are common around the buildings on the island, Finkelstein said. Many chicks with lead poisoning don't have droopwing, but likely suffer from other forms of toxicity that lower their chances of survival, she said. Chicks with droopwing may survive as long as their parents are feeding them, but once they reach the fledgling stage and their parents abandon them, they are doomed to starvation because they can't fly. Other affected chicks may die sooner from complications of lead poisoning, Finkelstein said.</p>
<p>Midway hosts the largest known breeding population of Laysan albatross, accounting for about 65 percent of the total global population. The most recent census, in 2001, counted 287,000 breeding pairs. Many other species of seabirds also nest on the atoll's tiny islands. The albatross nest on the ground and have no fear of humans, so their nests are found not only in open fields but also scattered among the buildings and beside roads and walkways.</p>
<p>"It's an amazing thing to see. The birds are everywhere," Finkelstein said.</p>
<p>Finkelstein looked at albatross chicks from two sites, one near buildings and another in an open field with no known source of lead contamination. She collected blood samples from the chicks and soil and paint chips from each chick's nest. All the samples were analyzed for lead levels and isotopic composition using a highly sensitive mass spectrometer.</p>
<p>There are four naturally occurring isotopes of lead, and their ratios may vary depending on the source of the lead sample. Different layers of paint on the buildings at Midway had different isotope signatures, and the blood samples and soil samples also varied widely in their isotope compositions. To identify the source of exposure, the researchers had to use a "case study" approach, looking at each chick individually and the samples taken from its nest. They found a strong correlation between the isotope signatures in a chick's blood and the signatures in paint chips from its nest. There was no correlation with isotope signatures from soil samples.</p>
<p>Lee Ann Woodward, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service contamination specialist for the Pacific Region, said it's not hard to understand how the chicks are ingesting paint chips.</p>
<p>"I call it the bored chick syndrome," she said. "They're sitting on the nest for six months and they constantly groom the nest and the area around it."</p>
<p>The Fish and Wildlife Service is taking steps to deal with the problem, Woodward said. Although the number of chicks affected by lead poisoning is small compared to other causes of mortality and is not a threat to the overall population, the agency takes the issue very seriously, she said.</p>
<p>"This study has been very helpful to us in pointing out the need to do something," Woodward said. "We have gotten funding this year to go out and determine how extensive the problem is and what it would take to deal with it. Because it's such a remote site and any equipment has to be sent out on barges, we really need to have a good idea ahead of time what the scope of the operation will have to be."</p>
<p>Smith said the situation on Midway underscores the potential for environmental and public health hazards on decommissioned military bases, many of which serve as wildlife refuges. Lead-based paint is just one of many potential hazards at these sites, he said.</p>

As one of Everson's crew of five students, he would help turn out "fine press" works of literature on an old Ben Franklin-style platen press.</p><p><table BGCOLOR="#FFCC33" align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="3" valign="TOP" width="50%"><tr><td><b><font color="#333333">Student Winners Tour Santa Cruz Book Arts Studio</font></b></td></tr></table>That early experience made quite an impression on Thomas and in 1976, along with his wife and fellow book artist Donna, he established a private press in Santa Cruz. Since then, the Thomases have been creating artistic books that are exhibited across the country and have been purchased for collections around the world. Now they hope to inspire a new generation of students by establishing a brand-new award program at UC Santa Cruz.</p><p>Last month, the Thomases selected two art students to receive the 2003 Book Arts/Artist Award and invited them to visit their studio in Santa Cruz for a tour. Although each award comes with a check for $100, the ultimate goal is to give the students an opportunity to meet with working artists and encourage them to explore the book as a medium of artistic expression. </p><p>"We created the award because it can make a big difference in your life when you are recognized for something that you've done," Donna explained. "I had been thinking of a wonderful art teacher who inspired me to pursue my art."</p><p>The Thomases attended open studio events at UC Santa Cruz, looking for fresh ideas and inspiration, as well as the work of two students to receive the inaugural awards. But they deliberately examined a variety of media that went far beyond the traditional concept of book arts.</p><p>"We looked at the whole department--painting, sculpture, drawing, installations," said Peter, who graduated from the university in 1978 with a degree in aesthetic studies. "We were looking for works that have booklike qualities, not necessarily work designed as a book."</p><p>Michael Selby's art project--a series of five painted antique ironing boards which told a visual story of his family's past--fit into the Thomases' definition of a conceptual or triptych/shrine book. They found that moving from one painted object to another incorporated the element of time, and was very much like turning the pages of a book.</p><p>"I had lost my father and was going through my photo albums, grabbing photos and painting stories from them," Selby said of his inspiration for the piece. "I was interested in where you are in a moment in time. Looking at faded photos is like looking at a history book."</p><p>Katie Frank's striking, yet simply-bound book--consisting of transparent overlays of sign language graphics upon photographs of her friends making the signs--also caught the eye of the Thomases. Frank's award certificate noted that the book's strength lies in "the juxtaposition of the photographic images with the American Sign Language diagrams for the animal they represent." </p><p>Both students said they were thrilled to be selected for the award, which took them completely by surprise. They also expressed their appreciation for the opportunity to tour the Thomases' studio and see their work.</p><p>"It was nice to meet the people who were offering the award as opposed to just receiving a piece of paper and that be the end of it," Selby said. "It was such a personable experience to be able to talk with Peter and Donna about their art and how it related to ours."</p><p>The Thomases continue to produce several miniature and full-size book editions each year. Peter has recently been constructing a series of books out of old ukuleles and accordions, cleverly modifying the musical instruments into a variety of book formats and sculptures. Donna's latest projects have been miniature, one-of-a-kind books about nature that incorporate calligraphy text, original watercolor illustrations, and tiny leather picture onlays. </p><p>More information about the work of Peter and Donna Thomas can be found at their web site: http://members.cruzio.com/~peteranddonna/</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d028c8072704601a012ff75689ed6"><name>374</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Three UC Santa Cruz faculty awarded Presidental Chairs</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1058252400000</start-date><display-name>Three UC Santa Cruz...</display-name><path>/2003/07/374</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/07/374</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337997403</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337997403</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Three faculty members at the University of California, Santa Cruz-history professor Edmund Burke, III, psychology professor Barbara Rogoff, and literature professor Helene Moglen-have been appointed to Presidential Chairs on the Santa Cruz campus.</p><p>	UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood made the appointments, which extend from July 1, 2003, through June 30, 2006. Annual support for each chair is $45,000 and will fund proposals made by the appointees previous to their selection.</p><p>	"These three exceptional scholars help distinguish our campus, and it is an honor to recognize them," Greenwood said. "Each professor has crafted a proposal to develop innovative research by faculty and students. All of the projects promise to have far-reaching and enduring impact." </p><p>The Santa Cruz campus has appointed five Presidential Chairs in the past: Professor Hayden White, Historical Studies (1983-88), Professor Richard Wasserstrom, Moral Philosophy (1988-91), Professor Angela Davis, African American and Feminist Studies (1995-97), Professor David Haussler, Bioinformatics (2000-03), and Professor David Hoy, Interdisciplinary Critical Thinking (2000-03).</p><p>The president of the University of California supports Presidential Chairs on each of the ten UC campuses through an endowment established in 1981 by the UC Regents. The positions are offered to distinguished members of the university's faculty and are intended to encourage new or interdisciplinary program development or to enhance quality in existing academic programs.</p><p>Professor Burke is a major figure in the field of world history. His proposal to establish a World History Center at UCSC would not only benefit the History Department, but would also strengthen the campus reputation for excellence in research and world history. Burke's proposal is broad in its scope, and is meant to be inclusive in order to bring together a number of colleagues as he works to initiate the process of developing a new cluster of research and teaching in the History Department.</p><p> "The establishment of a center for world history at UCSC will be the first such center in UC and has a two-fold mission," Burke noted. "One aim is to provide training in teaching world history for history faculty and graduate students at all levels of the history curriculum including lower division, upper division and graduate courses. A second aim is to support the department's research cluster in Colonialism, Race and Trans-National Movements in conjunction with the all-UC multi-campus research group, The World History Workshop. World and trans-national history is a major new research trend within the field of history, and this project aims to foster its further development."</p><p> </p><p>Professor Moglen, a well-known literary critic and feminist theorist, is the director of the new Institute for Advanced Feminist Research at UCSC. The Institute brings together faculty, graduate students, artists, journalists, and public intellectuals to work on projects that are historical, international, and interdisciplinary in conception, and collaborative and experimental in practice.  Moglen has proposed to use the resources awarded to the Chair to support programming for the Institute. Her intellectual qualifications, leadership skills, contacts across campus, and openness to the visions of the larger feminist community have all contributed toward the remarkable success that the Institute has already achieved. </p><p>"With the support of funds provided by the Presidential Chair, I hope to help realize the ambitious goals of the Institute's participants," Moglen said.  </p><p>Professor Rogoff is the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Professor of Psychology and an internationally recognized scholar in the field of developmental psychology.  Her proposal is to assemble an interdisciplinary, intergenerational set of scholars to study how social interaction is organized in support of learning in communities where schooling has not been prevalent, particularly in indigenous communities of North and Central America. </p><p>"The Chair will allow me to convene a group of leading scholars and students to make headway on understanding the processes of supporting learning within informal community settings," Rogoff noted. "In many of these communities, children learn very effectively through being involved with their families' everyday activities. Studying how such engagements are structured will help us understand how children's learning and adult-child interaction varies across communities, and how learning everywhere might be facilitated."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d03da8072704601a012ff0798f58d"><name>375</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz professor lauded for work to preserve Bengali films</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>UCSC, dilip basu, Satyajit Ray, Film</keywords><start-date>1058338800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz professor...</display-name><path>/2003/07/375</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/07/375</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337997731</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337997731</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Cultural Association of Bengal has honored UC Santa Cruz associate professor of history Dilip K. Basu with a Distinguished Service Award for his efforts to preserve classic Bengali films. The award was presented at the North American Bengali Conference held at the Long Beach Convention Center in Los Angeles. </p><p>Basu has worked during the past decade to establish a world-class archives and study center on renowned Indian film director Satyajit Ray at UC Santa Cruz. He also contributed to the international effort that led to Ray's Lifetime Achievement Oscar award in 1992.</p><p> Basu personally brought the Oscar to Ray in his Calcutta hospital room and filmed his acceptance speech, which was later broadcast at the Academy Awards ceremony. At a banquet after the event, Audrey Hepburn asked him to help restore Ray's films. Utilizing an initial grant from the Academy, Basu helped establish the Satyajit Ray Film and Study Collection at UC Santa Cruz and the Ray Society in Calcutta.</p><p>Basu organized the restoration and preservation of Ray's films at the Academy of Motion Picture Archives in Los Angeles. Thirteen of Ray's 36 films have now been restored at a cost of $1.7 million. Basu also obtained commitments from the Academy, the Packard Humanities Institute, and Martin Scorsese's Film Foundation to help pay the restoration costs of the rest of Ray's films, at an estimated cost of several million dollars.</p><p>Basu has additionally helped orchestrate a number of Ray retrospectives in Europe and North America during the past two years, at venues such as the Smithsonian and the National Gallery of Art (inaugurated by Martin Scorsese) in Washington, D.C., the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (inaugurated by Sharmila Tagore), the British Film Institute (inaugurated by Ravi Shankar) in London, and at the Cinematheque in Toronto (inaugurated by Norman Jewison).</p><p> </p><p>Beginning September 22, all 36 of Ray's films will be shown for a three-month period at the Stanford Theater in Palo Alto, California. Complete retrospectives are also planned next year at the Berlin International Film Festival, the Priya and Globe Cinemas in Calcutta, and at the Harvard Film Archive in Boston.</p><p>With support from UC Santa Cruz Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood-who has traveled to India twice with him during the past three years-Basu helped establish the South Asian Studies Initiative at UC Santa Cruz in 1999. The initial focus has been on arts and music with the creation of an endowment in classical North Indian music named after UC Santa Cruz distinguished adjunct professor and master musician Ali Akbar Khan. To date, donors have pledged more than $2 million for the arts, and the university has made appointments in teaching Hindi and South Asian art history, women's studies, and politics. </p><p>  </p><p>The UC Santa Cruz Satyajit Ray Film and Study Collection now contains 31 of Ray's 36 films in 35 mm, as well as a collection of 7,000 items about Ray.

<p>Whether it's Egyptian teachers, Fulbright Scholars, or professionals participating in the Humphrey Fellows program, UCSC is drawing an international clientele.</p>
<p>A group of 25 teachers from Egypt have just headed home following a teacher-training initiative, and now the University Town Center, the program's base, is playing host to 10 Fulbright Scholars. On July 21, 26 Humphrey Fellows--midcareer professionals preparing for a year of study and professional experience at American universities--will arrive for a three-week orientation.</p>
<p>While the focus of the Egyptian group was on training teachers to train other teachers, the aim of the intensive Fulbright and Humphrey Scholars sessions is to orient participants to the ways of American universities.</p>
<p>There is a heavy emphasis on fine-tuning English skills, and also an effort to ease participants into American culture. Some of the Fulbright Scholars audit or enroll in UCSC classes, and they get further acclimated to the United States by having UCSC student roommates.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest adjustments involve nonacademic issues, noted Lori Buehring of the English Language and International Programs department. "Many of the the students are married, and this is the first time they've lived alone," she said. They also often are not used to cooking, and have trouble finding familiar foods in local grocery stores, she added.</p>
<p>Community and government tours and weekend trips are planned to help the Humphrey Fellows learn more about the United States, said program host Jay Minert. They will also be matched with cultural and professional mentors.</p>
<p>Academic sessions are tailored to each group's needs. For the Fulbright Scholars, who are being prepared to work toward master's degrees and Ph.D.s at American universities, the focus is on English skills, writing, and other academic preparation for American graduate schools. 'They're learning about what's expected in the United States university system," said Lorie Buehring of UCSC Extension. The students are engaged in many fields, including marine biology, library science, natural resource management, and marketing. In August, the Fulbright Scholars will start leaving Santa Cruz to begin graduate school at institutions as varied as Yale, Purdue, Texas A&amp;M, and San Jose State. While Fulbright orientations were once conducted only in the summer, the program is now year-round.</p>
<p>The Humphrey Fellows will undergo an intensive week of English practice, followed by sessions on presentation skills, intercultural communication issues, academic honesty, and computer workshops. The fellows come from many countries, including China, Slovakia, Brazil, and Middle Eastern nations. "Some of them are very well established in their home countries," said Minert. The fellows include pharmacists, economists, doctors, bankers, and educators--"It is a pretty wide range."</p>
<p>A Global Forum is scheduled for August 6 and 7 to showcase the Humphrey Fellows and give other members of the campus community a chance to meet them before they move on to their assigned universities in the east. Details of the event will be decided later this summer.</p>
<p>The Fulbright Program was established in 1946 under legislation introduced by the U.S. senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas. The Humphrey Fellowship Program was founded in 1978 in honor of U.S. senator and vice president Hubert H. Humphrey. Both programs are federally funded.</p>
<p>####</p>
<p>NOTE: Interviews with one or more of the Humphrey Fellows may be possible after they arrive on July 21. Among them are:</p>
<p>Dr. Saosan Mamoun of Syria. Dr. Mamoun works for the Syrian Ministry of Health and will attend Tulane University as his host university. He will be studying public health policy and management.</p>
<p>Senghi Park of South Korea. Park works for the Ministry of Labor, and her major area of interest is human resource management. She will be studying at the University of North Carolina.</p>
<p>Dr. Reminder Kaur of Malaysia. Kaur works for the Department of Psychiatry in the Kuala Lumpur Hospital. Her major interest is substance abuse and prevention, and she will be studying at Johns Hopkins University.</p>

M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii has obtained the first maps showing the distribution of galaxies in the early universe. The maps show the clustering of galaxies into a variety of large-scale structures, including long filaments, empty voids, and dense groups and clusters.</p>
<p>These maps are among the first results from the DEEP2 Redshift Survey, an ongoing three-year project designed to study galaxies in the distant universe over a volume comparable to recent surveys of the local universe. Using the new DEIMOS (Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph) instrument at the 10-meter Keck II Telescope, this project is measuring the properties of distant galaxies as well as mapping out their distribution in space. DEIMOS, which was built precisely for this survey, allows simultaneous, detailed observations of up to 150 galaxies at a time. By studying galaxies whose light has taken billions of years to reach the Earth, the astronomers are effectively looking far back in time.</p>
<p>"For the first time, we are getting a map of the universe as it was 7 billion years ago, when it was roughly half the age it is now. Comparing these observations with local surveys will yield direct clues to some of the most profound mysteries of the universe, such as the nature of dark matter, the nature of dark energy, and the origins of galaxies and quasars," said David Koo, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Koo is presenting the group's first findings Thursday at a meeting of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in Sydney, Australia. The DEEP2 survey is a collaboration between astronomers at UC Santa Cruz, UC Berkeley, and several other institutions, including the California Institute of Technology and University of Hawaii. Marc Davis, professor of astronomy at UC Berkeley, is principal investigator for the current phase of the DEEP2 project. Sandra Faber, University Professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, led the team that designed and built DEIMOS at the Lick Observatory laboratories at UCSC.</p>
<p>"The DEIMOS data are so extensive compared to previous results that we can construct maps showing considerable large-scale structure, and we can see differences in the clustering of different types of galaxies," Davis said.</p>
<p>The structures seen in these maps of distant galaxies are similar to structures seen in the local universe, although DEEP2 shows them at an earlier stage of development.</p>
<p>"We are watching the galaxy population grow into what it is today," said Alison Coil, a graduate student at UC Berkeley who was the lead researcher on the analysis of the maps.</p>
<p>The maps presented at the IAU meeting are the first detailed three-dimensional pictures of the spatial distribution of galaxies in the early universe. They show the locations of galaxies in the distant universe in three of the four DEEP2 fields. Although the maps do not cover much area of the sky (observations so far cover an area about four times the size of the full moon), they extend very far along the line of sight, probing deep into the universe to reveal objects that are very distant in both space and time. This is a different strategy from current local surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the 2dF Survey, which cover very wide areas of the sky but probe much shorter distances along the line of sight, Coil said.</p>
<p>"This survey is extremely deep. Not only are we seeing objects more than 7 billion light-years away, but the survey itself covers 2.5 billion light-years, so we can see the evolution of the galaxy population within the DEEP2 survey, in addition to comparing it with local surveys," she said.</p>
<p>Statistical tests indicate that the clustering seen in the DEEP2 maps is not as strong as that seen in the local universe today, Coil said. Galaxies cluster under the force of gravity, and this clustering grows with time as structures get larger and exert stronger gravitational pulls, causing them to grow even more. Regions of space with high densities will exert their gravitational influence on surrounding galaxies, pulling them in toward the dense regions, which become even more dense in the process. While these dense regions are growing, empty voids are left behind where very few, if any, galaxies reside.</p>
<p>At the same time, the galaxies themselves are evolving: creating stars, forming black holes at their centers, falling in toward each other, and often colliding and merging to form larger galaxies. All of these processes can be seen in the DEEP2 data, Coil said.</p>
<p>DEEP2 observations will eventually map the locations of some 60,000 galaxies at distances of about 6 to 8 billion light-years. Seeing how the large-scale structures made up of galaxies evolved over time is just one aspect of the study. The researchers are also investigating the properties of the individual galaxies: their ages, how bright they are, how much matter they contain, how quickly they are forming stars, and so on.</p>
<p>"Our ability to, in effect, weigh these distant galaxies is a unique aspect of our survey," Koo said. "Galaxy mass is a fundamental parameter for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies, and by having this dimension we can study these questions with more precision than has been possible before."</p>
<p>Galaxies are represented on the maps with black or red symbols. The black points are galaxies that appear to be forming new stars in abundance, while the red points are galaxies that have little ongoing star formation, which generally are also older and redder. These older galaxies are much more strongly clustered in space than the star-forming galaxies. The researchers also found that galaxies with red colors are more clustered than bluer galaxies, and brighter galaxies cluster more strongly than fainter galaxies.</p>
<p>"These trends are similar to those seen in the local universe; but for the first time we can see that they were already in place 7 billion years after the Big Bang, before our own Sun and solar system had formed," Davis said.</p>
<p>This project was supported in part by grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The DEIMOS spectrograph was funded by a grant from CARA (Keck Observatory), by an NSF Facilities and Infrastructure grant, by the Center for Particle Astrophysics, and by gifts from Sun Microsystems and the Quantum Corporation. The DEEP2 Redshift Survey has been made possible through the dedicated efforts of the DEIMOS staff at UC Santa Cruz who built the instrument and the Keck Observatory staff who have supported it on the telescope.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d07ae8072704601a012ff92636072"><name>379</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC professor seeks to reconnect mathematics to its intellectual roots</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Anthony Tromba, mathematics,</keywords><start-date>1058770800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC professor seeks to...</display-name><path>/2003/07/379</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/07/379</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337998718</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337998718</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Anthony Tromba has loved mathematics since he was a child, and it bothers him that the field seems to be losing its appeal to students. Tromba, professor and chair of mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said that when he was an undergraduate in the 1960s there were nearly six times as many mathematics majors in the United States as there are today. Although there are probably many reasons for this trend, one factor may be the way mathematics tends to be taught, he said. </p><p>"People don't teach mathematics as an intellectual discipline, but more as a collection of facts or theorems, without putting it in the context of why one would be interested in it in the first place," Tromba said. </p><p>The connection of mathematics to the humanities and to its own roots as a discipline has been severed, he said. Tromba has tried to counter this trend in the new edition of his widely used textbook, Vector Calculus, coauthored with Jerrold Marsden of the California Institute of Technology. The book has been a standard university textbook for more than 27 years and has been translated into six languages. Nevertheless, Tromba said he felt it was time for a change. The revised 5th edition, published this month by W. H. Freeman, features a striking portrait of Isaac Newton on the cover and a whole new approach in the text. </p><p>"We radically changed it. We tried to put the mathematics in historical context and illuminate the thought processes that lead to mathematical results," Tromba said. </p><p>Tromba's 1996 book The Parsimonious Universe, coauthored with Stefan Hildebrandt, took a similar approach, while aiming for a more general readership. Written in a lively and accessible style, the book explores mathematical insights into the variety of shapes and forms found in the natural world.</p><p>Tromba enjoys contemplating the insights of the great mathematicians of the past--intellectual giants like Newton, Leibniz, Huygens, and Galileo. Perhaps the most breathtaking insight of all, he said, was the conclusion of the ancient Greeks that the world could be understood through mathematics. </p><p>"This was a very profound insight, because we really don't understand the universe. The universe is mind-boggling--it is beyond human comprehension--and yet we can deal with it on a theoretical basis using mathematical models," Tromba said.</p><p>The power of such models is apparent from the many instances in which formal mathematical theories have predicted natural phenomena that were not discovered or confirmed until many years later. Maxwell's equations, for example, predicted radio waves, and Einstein's field equations predicted that gravity would bend light and that the universe is expanding. </p><p>To students, mathematics can often seem like little more than a set of arcane rules for manipulating abstract symbols. According to Tromba, however, there is a mystical aspect of mathematics that is not often communicated to students. </p><p>"When you discover mathematical structures that you believe correspond to the world around you, you feel you are seeing something mystical, something profound," he said. "You are communicating with the universe, seeing beautiful and deep structures and patterns that no one without your training can see." </p><p>Tromba noted that mathematicians do not invent mathematics, they discover it.  </p><p>"The mathematics is there, it's leading you, and you are discovering it," he said. "Mathematics is a profound language, an awesomely beautiful language. For some, like Leibniz, it is the language of God. I'm not religious, but I do believe that the universe is organized mathematically."</p><p>Tromba has been honored recently for both his teaching and his contributions to mathematics. He received an Excellence in Teaching Award for 2001-02 from UCSC's Academic Senate, and in May 2003, Tromba's colleagues held a symposium in honor of his 60th birthday (which is in August). Dubbed "Tony Fest," the symposium brought together many of the mathematicians Tromba has worked with during his career for two days of lectures and social activities. Though initially reluctant to be the object of such attention, Tromba said he was very moved by the event.</p><p>"One of the great things in my life has been to be able to interact with brilliant mathematicians, to work with some of them, and to understand their genius," he said. "I don't consider myself one of them, but to understand and to be blown away by such awesome genius--it's like coming close to Mozart or Bach." </p><p>Although Tromba speaks eloquently about the intellectual thrills of mathematics, he acknowledges that such thrills are really only accessible to mathematicians.</p><p>"With art and music, people can feel the greatness of the work without actually understanding its structure and complexity. You don't have to be a musician to appreciate Mozart's Requiem, but mathematics doesn't afford you the same opportunity--it's a very small club," he said.</p><p>Tromba is doing his best to encourage more students to join that club.</p><p>                                                                   </p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Tromba at (831) 459-2794 or tromba@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d08fe8072704601a012ff421ac73c"><name>380</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Seymour Center at Long Marine Lab offers tours in Spanish</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Seymour Center at Long Marine Lab, Institute of Marine Sciences, Spanish language</keywords><start-date>1058770800000</start-date><display-name>Seymour Center at Long...</display-name><path>/2003/07/380</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/07/380</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282337999027</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282337999027</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Seymour Marine Discovery Center has initiated a series of Spanish-language tours of the popular science education center, located at UC Santa Cruz's Long Marine Laboratory.

But 6,000 years ago, the California Current wasn't quite what it is today, according to a team of researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><p>New findings suggest that coastal upwelling in the California Current was significantly weaker 6,000 years ago than it is today as a result of differences in Earth's orbit around the Sun. This hypothesis is based on a combination of results from computer modeling of the California regional climate and analysis of geologic records. Noah Diffenbaugh, a graduate student in Earth sciences at UCSC, is presenting the new results this week at a meeting of the International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA) in Reno, Nevada, July 24 through 30.  </p><p>The past 11,000 years is known as the Holocene, or "Age of Humans," when people became the dominant shapers of regional and global environments. Archaeological records indicate that the mid-Holocene (8,000 to 3,000 years ago) was a particularly important period of global climatic and cultural transition, with important innovations in agricultural, architectural, and ceremonial complexity occurring throughout the world. </p><p>Geological records suggest that these increases in cultural complexity coincided with regional climatic change, and evidence for such changes has been seen in archaeological and geological records from the Pacific Coast in the California Current region. It has not been clear, however, exactly how climate and culture interacted in the California Current region during that time.  </p><p>The high biological productivity of California's coastal waters is a direct result of the spring and summer upwelling season, which brings deep, cold, nutrient-rich waters to the ocean surface, supporting a diverse and complex ecosystem. While ancient peoples would likely have been affected by changes in the California Current through time, the geologic record of mid-Holocene California Current upwelling is ambiguous, with some studies indicating increased mid-Holocene upwelling and others reduced.  </p><p>In order to better understand the nature of coastal upwelling in the California Current at that time, the UCSC researchers employed a high-resolution regional climate model. The regional climate model was developed by a team led by Diffenbaugh's adviser, professor of Earth sciences Lisa Sloan. The model showed that 6,000 years ago, the California Current was affected by differences in the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth due to predictable changes in Earth's orbit.</p><p>At the INQUA Congress, Diffenbaugh will present results from the climate model in conjunction with geologic data from the California Current analyzed by a group of researchers headed by John Barron of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Menlo Park, California. </p><p>The combined results indicate that, relative to the present, the mid-Holocene California Current upwelling season was longer and less vigorous than today, with reduced seasonal contrast. Such a change in California Current activity would have impacted marine ecosystems and perhaps also affected ancient human communities relying on those marine resources. </p><p>The comparison of geologic data and climate model results presented by the UCSC-USGS team helps to explain the evolution of California Current activity during the Holocene. It may also provide insight into the environmental factors that shaped anthropological change in the region during the culturally important mid-Holocene.</p><p>The primary results to be presented at the INQUA Congress were published recently in <I>Paleoceanography</I>, a peer-reviewed journal published by the American Geophysical Union:  </p><p>--Diffenbaugh, N.S., L.C.
