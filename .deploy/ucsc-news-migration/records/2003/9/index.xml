The total marked the second-largest amount ever raised by the campus. A record $24.4 million was raised in 2000.</p><p>"This outstanding level of support will allow the campus to continue its key role in an array of disciplines, from adaptive optics to the New Teacher Center," said Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "The generous support from our donors is especially critical as the campus faces the funding challenges posed by the state budget shortfall."</p><p>The largest single gift came from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, which gave $9.1 million to establish a Laboratory for Adaptive Optics. The</p><p>new laboratory strengthens UCSC's position as an astronomy powerhouse and a national center for research in adaptive optics, which sharpen the vision of ground-based telescopes by removing the blurring effects of the Earth's atmosphere. The grant is the largest contribution from a private foundation in the history of the campus.</p><p>A tradition of support for the Baskin School of Engineering continued with a $1 million gift from the school's namesake, retired engineer and philanthropist Jack Baskin. The latest contribution will help fund a second engineering building now under construction and will create an endowed chair in the newly forming Department of Biomolecular Engineering.</p><p>Making science more engaging for undergraduates was the goal of a $1 million grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to Manuel Ares. Ares, a professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, was one of 20 scientists nationwide who were appointed Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professors.</p><p>The New Teacher Center drew $1.66 million from various sources, including a $750,000 grant from the Carnegie Corporation. The Carnegie grant will allow the innovative education center to further expand its reach by working with selected postsecondary education departments. Under the partnership, support for new teachers will extend from college preparation through their first two years in the classroom.</p><p>A research project on how to bridge the digital divide affecting Latinos brought the Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community a $249,449 award from the W. T. Grant Foundation. Including additional grants, the center raised a total of $425,000.</p><p>The University Library's Special Collections was enhanced by a donation of photographs, valued at close to $800,000, from renowned California photographers Pirkle Jones and his late wife, Ruth-Marion Baruch. The photographs, part of the Jones and Baruch archive that has been bequeathed to the library, include the couple's landmark 1968 documentary series on the Black Panther Party.</p><p>The archive of science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein, also held in Special Collections, received a cash gift of $141,000. The gift, from the estate of Heinlein's widow, Virginia, was accompanied by an additional $36,000 grant from the Heinlein Trust to support the work of the UCSC Heinlein Scholar in organizing and preserving the archive and preparing it for scholarly use. The Heinlein archive features a priceless collection of the author's original manuscripts, correspondence, and personal library.</p><p>"Private philanthropy is crucial as UC Santa Cruz fulfills its mission for teaching, research, and community service," said Ronald P. Suduiko, vice chancellor for University Relations at UC Santa Cruz. "The remarkable level of support we've received this year demonstrates a broad base of generous donors, affirming the excellence of our faculty and students, and the hard work of our development staff."</p><p>Individual donors provided crucial support to the campus. In the last fiscal year, gifts to the Annual Fund, including gifts from UCSC Alumni Association councilors, other alumni, UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustees, parents, and friends, totaled $2,600,920. This includes $100,109 for the Alumni Association Scholarship Fund.</p><p>Trustees of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, which supports the campus through advocacy and private fundraising efforts, gave $1,295,891 this past year, with 100 percent participation from board members.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d13758072704601a012fffa1ae2f3"><name>389</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Scholarship enables aspiring teacher to enroll at UC Santa Cruz</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1063004400000</start-date><display-name>Scholarship enables aspiring teacher...</display-name><path>/2003/09/389</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/09/389</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338001722</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338001722</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Louise Hagio wants to be a teacher, and thanks to a $5,000 scholarship from the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am Youth Fund, her goal is closer than ever.</p>
<p>Hagio, 30, is enrolling this month at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where she plans to major in history with a minor in education. She hopes to teach American history at the high school level.</p>
<p>Hagio is pursuing her goal with support from the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am Youth Fund, which funds scholarships and youth-oriented charities with proceeds from the annual golf tournament. Students transferring to UCSC from Monterey Peninsula College (MPC) or Hartnell College were eligible to receive the scholarship.</p>
<p>A single mother of two, Hagio was inspired to become a teacher by the hours she spent volunteering in her children's classrooms. Her own path to higher education has been challenging; she left high school at a young age to become self-supporting, and put off college to raise her children and support her family.</p>
<p>After enrolling at MPC, though, Hagio discovered a passion for learning and a desire to share her enthusiasm with young people. She worked as an instructional assistant in astronomy at MPC while earning an overall GPA of 3.81. An accomplished horsewoman, Hagio has been a riding instructor and horse trainer for many years.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d14d18072704601a012ff95560b9d"><name>390</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz genome group is among 25 global innovators honored by The Tech Museum of Innovation</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1062658800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz genome...</display-name><path>/2003/09/390</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/09/390</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338002037</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338002037</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE) at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has been honored by the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose as one of 25 laureates for the 2003 Tech Museum Awards: Technology Benefiting Humanity.

But few people realize that the prolific writer thought of himself primarily as a composer of music.</p><p>	A new book co-edited by UC Santa Cruz lecturer Irene Herrmann, Paul Bowles on Music, spotlights the intersection of his two great passions--writing and music. The volume is a collection of music criticism by Bowles, written between 1935 and 1946, that has never before been compiled in book form. </p><p>It contains reviews Bowles penned as the music critic for the New York Herald Tribune, as well as complete reprints of essays on music that he contributed to Modern Music magazine, a renowned periodical of the '30s and '40s that distinguished itself through the highly literate composers--such as Aaron Copland and Virgil Thomson--who wrote about music in its pages,</p><p>The incisive and often humorous pieces cover classical, film, popular, and ethnic music, including important premieres of works by Copland, Cage, Shostakovich, and Stravinsky. They range from reviews of top jazz concerts of the day in Harlem, to debut recitals by emigre virtuosos, to performances by Frank Sinatra, in a compilation that highlights an extraordinary era of American musical history. </p><p>"We had over 450 reviews and we distilled it down to about 200," Herrmann said. "We had to decide what genres to include-we ended up putting in all of the pieces on jazz. We also wanted to put in some negative reviews, because they're always the most entertaining."</p><p> "They read well today," Herrmann added. "It's fascinating to learn what people thought of that music at its first hearing."</p><p>A staff accompanist for the UC Santa Cruz Music Department for more than two decades, Herrmann recorded her own solo piano and chamber music CD of Bowles's music on the Koch record label in 1995. She also happens to be the inheritor of Bowles's musical estate, which contains several previously unrecorded works by the composer. Herrmann met Bowles in 1992 when she began to research his music.</p><p>"I'm interested in American music, and I was looking for repertoire for concerts,"  Herrmann recalled. "I think Paul enjoyed my company, and enjoyed listening to music with me. On my first visit, I brought and played some piano music for him from some manuscripts that I had found in a Bowles archive housed at the University of Texas Special Collections in Austin. It was his own music that he hadn't heard in 40 years." </p><p> After that first encounter, Herrmann regularly traveled to visit Bowles at his apartment in Tangier, Morocco, every summer until his death in 1999. Bowles designated  Herrmann as the inheritor of his musical estate in 1996.</p><p>"I think he realized that I knew more about his music--where it was, what was available--than anyone else," Herrmann said. "I had done a lot of work already organizing that information. And by great luck, I had found some of his long-lost manuscripts from the '30s--about 10 or 12 pieces."</p><p>Throughout his lifetime, Bowles composed a variety of musical scores, four novels, 60 short stories, various travel pieces, and dozens of translations of Moroccan stories. In the 1930s, he was also the premier theater composer of live incidental music, collaborating with such luminaries as John Houseman, Orson Welles, William Saroyan, and Lillian Hellman. </p><p>Bowles's original music accompanied numerous Broadway productions, including major plays by Tennessee Williams, beginning with the Glass Menagerie in 1944. The Museum of Modern Art in New York also presented a performance of Bowles's zarzuela, The Wind Remains, conducted by Leonard Bernstein and choreographed by Merce Cunningham. </p><p> Co-edited by southern California classical music critic Timothy Mangan, Paul Bowles on Music additionally includes the last recorded interview with Bowles. It was conducted by Herrmann in Tangier, shortly before his death in 1999.</p><p>"Paul didn't like to talk about his writing, but he liked to talk about his music," Herrmann recalled. "Toward the end of his life, he was really fragile, so rather than converse, we spent lots of time listening to music together. He liked to listen to Lou Harrison, French composers like Germaine Tailleferre and Satie, and his favorite--Stravinsky." </p><p>Hermann ultimately inherited the music of Bowles's estate, including all of his sound recordings. With the help of UC Santa Cruz library bibliographer Paul Machlis, she arranged to have them categorized and transferred onto CD. </p><p>"He had seemingly endless piles of cassettes with performances of his music that others had sent him-things like live radio broadcasts from France. They were found in disarray in his apartment," Herrmann said. "So Special Collections at UC Santa Cruz now has the most complete archive on Bowles's non-commercial music available--on about 25 CDS," she noted.</p><p>_____</p><p>More information about Paul Bowles can be found on his official web site: <a href="http://www.paulbowles.org">www.paulbowles.org</a>. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d17948072704601a012ff6e8987cc"><name>392</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New book debunks conservatives' call for color-blind society</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1063609200000</start-date><display-name>New book debunks conservatives'...</display-name><path>/2003/09/392</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/09/392</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338002778</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338002778</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Ward Connerly's latest race-related ballot initiative, Proposition 54 on California's Oct. 7 ballot, would prohibit the state from gathering racial information about students and employees. Connerly says his "Racial Privacy Initiative" is the next step toward achieving a colorblind society. Balderdash, say the authors of the new book <i>Whitewashing Race: The Myth of a Color-Blind Society.</i></p><p><table BGCOLOR="#FFCC33" align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="3" valign="TOP" width="50%"><tr><td><b><font color="#333333"><i>Whitewashing Race: The Myth of a Color-Blind Society</i> attributes gap to legacy of policies that favor whites, not personal prejudice or blacks' failures</font></b></td></tr></table>"Proposition 54 is another attempt to whitewash the fact that our society is built upon unequal access to social and economic advantage," said coauthor Michael K. Brown, professor of politics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "The color of one's skin still determines success or failure, poverty or affluence, illness or health, prison or college." </p><p>Whitewashing Race: The Myth of a Color-Blind Society takes a new look at the role of race in U.S. society, showing the cumulative effects of inequality on blacks and the long-term positive effects of institutional discrimination on whites. The authors provide a compelling analysis of the institutional roots of racial disparity in the United States, and they discuss the ways to transform these institutions in today's post-affirmative action era.</p><p>Called "an empirically grounded assault on the vast body of colorblind orthodoxy" by Lani Guinier, Whitewashing Race is the culmination of two years' work by a team of highly respected sociologists, political scientists, economists, criminologists, and legal scholars who challenged the claim made by Connerly and others that the United States has "solved its race problem." Brown and David Wellman, professor of community studies at UCSC, were lead authors on the text, which was coauthored by Martin Carnoy, professor of education and economics at Stanford University; Elliott Currie, a research associate at UC Berkeley; Troy Duster, professor of sociology at UC Berkeley; David B. Oppenheimer, associate dean for academic affairs and professor of law at Golden Gate University; and Marjorie M. Shultz, professor of law at UC Berkeley.</p><p>	By any measure--health, education, wealth, employment--black Americans lag far behind whites, the authors found:</p><p>o The black infant mortality rate remains twice as high as the white rate, and black age-adjusted mortality rates in 1995 were 1.61 times that of whites. Private nursing homes continue to be racially segregated, and nonwhites are almost twice as likely as whites to be admitted to a nursing home sanctioned by state officials for serious deficiencies in care and facilities.</p><p>o African Americans are the most residentially segregated group in the United States and are far less likely to own a home; when they do get a mortgage, they receive far less favorable terms than comparable whites. </p><p>o The ratio of black to white income is 62 percent, but the ratio of black to white median net worth is just 8 percent.</p><p>With its focus on institutional processes, Whitewashing Race shows, among other things, how the real estate and mortgage lending industries sustain segregated housing markets and discriminate against would-be black homeowners, and how a large number of small decisions by police produce widespread  discrimination in the criminal justice system. "Racial inequality is both generated and sustained by routine organizational rules and practices that on the surface appear to have nothing to do with race," said Brown.</p><p>The authors write that whites have gained--or accumulated--opportunities, while blacks and other racial groups have lost opportunities, suffering from disaccumulation of the benefits of economic opportunity.</p><p>"It's like a long-term investment," said Wellman. "If you set aside $40 a month and earn 5 percent interest, your investment will more than double in 25 years. Conversely, if you owe the IRS a few hundred dollars but don't pay the debt for a decade, you can find yourself owing several thousand dollars. Both advantages and disadvantages compound over time." Indeed, today's large gap in median net worth between blacks and whites is due largely to the discrepancy in the value of the equity in their respective homes, a gap that has compounded over time, said Wellman. </p><p>	Racial accumulation and disaccumulation occur in education, health care, and social and cultural opportunities, such as meeting "the right people" at Harvard, added Brown. In the criminal justice system, black juveniles "accumulate" incarceration at rates that far exceed whites.</p><p>	 These interlocking patterns of racialized accumulation and disaccumulation date back to 1641, when the right to own property, goods, and services was first restricted by race and gender. "Since the inception of the United States, wealth and institutional support have been invested on the white side of the color line and disinvested on the black side," said Wellman. </p><p>The result is what the authors call "durable racial inequality," the disparities that persist despite legislation and the changes in personal attitudes brought about by the civil rights movement. These institutional barriers to racial equality are overlooked in today's discussion of race, which revolves around the widespread belief that blacks themselves are responsible for their lower status. </p><p>"Many white Americans believe blacks have failed to take advantage of the opportunities created by the civil rights revolution," said Brown. "They reject policies like affirmative action because they are unaware of the ways in which their own lives have been enhanced by a legacy of unequal advantage. We need to change the scope of the debate to show the system of power and exclusion that benefits whites and disempowers black and Latino communities." </p><p>Instead of affirmative action, the authors propose a combination of public-sector spending and institutional change to root out racial inequality:</p><p>o The government must increase public investment in schools, jobs, and critical services in inner-city communities to reverse the legacy of disaccumulation.</p><p>o Wealth redistribution programs similar to the retraining programs that made World War II veterans upwardly mobile should focus on funding minority education and business startups.</p><p>o Universal access to health care, coupled with an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit, housing subsidies, and an unemployment system that reflects the reality of today's labor market, would provide key social and economic benefits that supplement earned income. </p><p>In addition, antidiscrimination laws must be strengthened and augmented; diversity in higher education must be promoted; and many routine practices in the criminal justice system must be revisited. </p><p>_____</p><p>Note to Journalists: You may contact Brown at (831) 459-2052 or popcorn@ucsc.edu and Wellman at (831) 459-2695 or (510) 643-7238 or wellman@ucsc.edu. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d18e88072704601a012ff7b49792c"><name>393</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz's Long Marine Laboratory celebrates its 25th anniversary with a special lecture series and public programs</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1063609200000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz's Long...</display-name><path>/2003/09/393</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/09/393</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338003128</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338003128</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Long Marine Laboratory turns 25 this fall, and the oceanside research facility will be celebrating its silver anniversary with a variety of public programs, tours, and lectures during the first 25 days in October. Highlighting the October celebration is a stellar lineup of speakers for the lab's annual fall lecture series. In addition, there will be special exhibits and commemorative activities throughout the month at the lab's Seymour Marine Discovery Center.</p>
<p>Founded in 1978, the Joseph M. Long Marine Laboratory is a research facility of the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The lab is known throughout the world for innovative research on marine mammals, marine ecology, and issues relating to ocean health. The Seymour Marine Discovery Center, which runs the lab's public education and visitor programs, brings marine research to life for tens of thousands of schoolchildren and other visitors every year.</p>
<p>This year's fall lecture series, "Long Marine Lab: 25 Years of Marine Science," features seven prominent speakers on three Thursday evenings in October. Confirmed speakers include Julie Packard, Leon Panetta, Kathryn Sullivan, Burney Le Boeuf, Brian Walton, Sandy Lydon, and Gary Griggs (see below for a complete schedule). Talks begin at 7 p.m. at the Seymour Center. Admission is $5 for members, $8 for the general public. Seating is limited, so advance purchase is recommended. Tickets can be purchased at the center or by phone at (831) 459-3800.</p>
<p>On weekends throughout October, the Seymour Center will be offering docent-led tours nearly every hour. There will be two "See More" presentations every day, one on the discovery of "marine snow" by UCSC ocean scientist Mary Silver and another on the story of "Ms. Blue," the blue whale whose 87-foot skeleton has become the Long Marine Lab mascot.</p>
<p>The center's touch tanks and aquariums will feature the usual variety of fascinating marine life, including Chinook salmon in the seasonal tank and 25 different types of crabs. The history of Long Marine Lab will be featured in 25 "fascinating facts" posted throughout the exhibit hall, and younger visitors can use a pirate's map to search for treasure in a "Silver Scavenger Hunt."</p>
<p>Additional information on all programs and events is available on the <a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu">Seymour Center web site</a> or by calling the center at (831) 459-3800.</p>

Scientists have been grappling with this deceptively simple question for years. Kenneth Nealson, the Wrigley Professor of Geobiology at the University of Southern California, is a leading authority on this issue, which he will address in a public lecture at the University of California, Santa Cruz, on Thursday, October 16.</p><p>Nealson's talk is the third Halliday Lecture, a public lecture series sponsored by the UCSC Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory. The lecture, "Recognizing Life Under Strange and Distant Rocks," begins at 8 p.m. in the Music Center Recital Hall on the UCSC campus. It is free and open to the public.</p><p>Nealson is a recognized pioneer of the young interdisciplinary field of geobiology, which studies the interrelation between the chemistry of life and the mineral and metal composition of the Earth. His recent interests have been directed toward the microbiology of life in extreme environments. He has chaired several NASA task groups charged with evaluating techniques in the search for nonterrestrial life in the solar system, particularly on Mars.</p><p>The basic proposition is this: If you have a rock from Mars, or any other extraterrestrial site, what can you do to decide if life is, or ever was, present? Life on other planets may take forms completely unlike those on Earth. But scientists can use physical and chemical measurements to search for things that "shouldn't be there," Nealson says. This inferential method may be necessary for finding unknown extraterrestrial life forms, and it involves a decidedly nonbiological approach, he says.</p><p>At USC, Nealson is affiliated with the Departments of Earth Sciences and Biological Sciences. Before joining the USC faculty in 2001, he was a senior scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. </p><p>The Halliday Lecture Series is made possible through the generous support of John Halliday to promote public awareness and appreciation for astronomy and astrophysics.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d1bd58072704601a012ffc4b1be06"><name>395</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New academic year underway; instruction begins on Thursday, September 25</title><author>Jim Burns (831/459-2495)</author><start-date>1063954800000</start-date><display-name>New academic year underway;...</display-name><path>/2003/09/395</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/09/395</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338003874</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338003874</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The first day of classes in the 2003-04 school year at UC Santa Cruz is Thursday, September 25.

A news conference to announce the landmark agreement is scheduled for Monday, September 22, at the Ames Research Center. (See NASA announcement at <a href="http://amesnews.arc.nasa.gov/releases/2003/03_73AR.html">amesnews.arc.nasa.gov/releases/2003/03_73AR.html</a>.)<br/>
<br/>
<p>"This collaboration brings together ideal partners for innovation," said UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood.</p>
<p>"This is a singular opportunity to advance important and potentially world-changing research. Our campus's keen interest in this project is supported by recognized research achievements and previous success in multidisciplinary and collaborative projects, such as the national Center for Adaptive Optics. The distinguished team of UC participants and our partners at San Jose State and Foothill and De Anza Community College District are eager to commence work with our NASA colleagues," Greenwood said.</p>
<p>NASA officials said the UARC will provide a unique combination of research and educational capabilities to meet NASA's mission requirements and to develop future human resources in technology and science.</p>
<p>"The UARC moves NASA and university collaborations in a whole new direction," said G. Scott Hubbard, director of the Ames Research Center.</p>
<p>"Typically, universities focus on fundamental research. With the new UARC, we are breaking down traditional institutional barriers to collaborate on mission-driven research that is on NASA's critical path," Hubbard said.</p>
<p>The new UARC will provide the Ames Research Center, located at Moffett Field in the heart of Silicon Valley, with additional research capabilities to fulfill NASA's mission requirements. The UARC's educational mission will enable students and university researchers to work side by side with Ames researchers on mission-critical problems to benefit the agency and the nation. Overall, the UARC will provide long-term continuity of top-tier research talent focused on NASA's growing multidisciplinary mission needs.</p>
<p>The initial focus of UARC research activities is likely to be in the areas of information technology and computer science, nanotechnology, and aerospace operations. Additional areas of interest include astrobiology, biotechnology, and fundamental space biology.</p>
<p>"There is a natural alignment between the research areas NASA has indicated it will want to pursue through the UARC and the research activities of UCSC science and engineering faculty," said UCSC vice chancellor for research Robert Miller.</p>
<p>William Berry, deputy director of UCSC's Silicon Valley Center, will serve as managing director of the UARC. Berry noted that the UARC will be able to tap the expertise of researchers throughout the UC system to accomplish NASA's research goals. For practical reasons, however, the UCSC campus is expected to play a central role in providing research capabilities for the UARC, he said.</p>
<p>"The UARC will provide exciting opportunities for UC faculty and students to become involved in the NASA research program. NASA is changing the way it does research by reaching beyond its boundaries, just as UCSC is reaching out into Silicon Valley, and this is creating an environment for great things to happen," Berry said.</p>
<p>The close collaboration with an established university system will enable the UARC to offer career opportunities to attract and retain the best researchers.

The evening will feature guest speakers, dance performances of Wong's choreography, plus a video montage of his life and work. A reception will follow the event, and attendees are encouraged to arrive early as seating is limited. However, overflow seating will be available in the adjacent Second Stage theater, where a live simulcast of the event will be broadcast.</p><p>	A retrospective of the visual art of Mel Wong, titled "Other Realms," will also be on display at the Bridge and J. B. Hall Galleries at UCSC's Porter College beginning on October 2. Although Wong's art has been exhibited in galleries and museums throughout the country, this marks the first time that the majority of his work will be displayed together in one place. </p><p>	Wong's artistic work covers a 40-year span, including paintings, drawings, sculpture, and pottery. His drawings were often created in conjunction with his choreography, and the resulting visual art was frequently displayed in New York theater lobbies. The exhibit will include early figurative drawings, ceramic pots and bowls, abstract paintings and drawings, as well as Wong's recent return to figurative paintings. Gallery hours at Porter College are Monday through Friday from noon until 5 p.m. The exhibit will run until October 28 with an Opening Reception set for Friday, October 10, from 5 to 7 p.m. </p><p>Wong died of a heart attack on July 17 at the age of 64, after swimming laps in Santa Cruz. He established an international reputation, first as a performer with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, and then as a choreographer, teacher, and performer with the Mel Wong Dance Company. He had been a professor of dance in the Theater Arts Department at UC Santa Cruz since 1989.</p><p>  	Choreographer and UCSC lecturer Tandy Beal noted in the San Francisco Chronicle: "He used dance art as a tool to unlock meaning for himself and the audience. His dances were quite stunning, with this air of spatial mystery." </p><p> UCSC theater arts professor James Bierman added, "Mel was very easygoing, but he was also quite playful as a person and an artist. He managed to make all of his students look good onstage, no matter what their skill level might be."</p><p>In 1983-84, Wong became the first Chinese American to receive a Guggenheim Fellowship in choreography. Throughout his lifetime, he choreographed more than 180 dances, and his works can be seen in the repertoires of companies in Canada, the U.S., Hong Kong, Japan, and Europe.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d1f608072704601a012fffba54fe6"><name>398</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz hosts October 10 symposium on higher education</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1064214000000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz hosts...</display-name><path>/2003/09/398</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2003/09/398</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338004785</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338004785</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The first annual Clark Kerr Symposium, taking place at UCSC on October 10, brings together some of the country's biggest names in higher education to discuss the unprecedented challenges facing public research universities in the 21st century.</p>

The program was designed by former UCSC Chancellor Karl S. Pister to make the university accessible to the most promising community college students in the area.</p><p>	"UC Santa Cruz is proud to welcome these students to our campus," said UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "They bring focus, motivation, and a depth of life experience that enriches the campus community."</p><p>	The scholarship program recognizes students who have made a demonstrated commitment to assisting and improving the lives of others, who have overcome adverse socioeconomic circumstances, and who might not otherwise be able to attend UCSC for financial reasons. Candidates are nominated by the presidents of each of 13 regional community colleges, and recipients are selected by the chancellor in consultation with the Leadership Opportunity Awards Program Screening Committee. </p><p>	A list of this year's recipients follows, with hometowns and college affiliations.

</table>
A no-host Indian dinner will be offered after the address, followed by a screening of the classic Satyajit Ray film Devi at 6:30 p.m. Actress Sharmila Tagore, star of the film, will appear in person after the screening to answer questions from the audience.<br/>
<br/>
<p>Pico Iyer has worked as a writer for Time magazine since 1982, and his articles appear often in Harper's, the New York Review of Books, the New York Times, Sports Illustrated, and Conde Nast Traveler. He is the author of numerous books, including Video Night in Kathmandu, The Lady and the Monk, Falling Off the Map, The Global Soul, Tropical Classical, and Abandon.</p>
<p>Literary Quarterly described Iyer as "the poet laureate of wanderlust. His perennial subject is the strange confluences and poignant idiosyncrasies born of our world's dissolving borders, and he explores it with a rich mixture of astonishing erudition and wide-eyed wonder."</p>
<p>Iyer will appear at UC Santa Cruz as part of the third Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture and Film Screening, an annual event presented by the university's Satyajit Ray Film and Study Collection. The lecture series was established by Anuradha Luther Maitra in honor of her husband, who was a scientist, entrepreneur, and admirer of the late Indian film director's work. The Satyajit Ray Film and Study Collection was founded in 1993 to acquire, preserve, and provide scholarly access to Ray's films, papers, books, and artwork.</p>
<p>Maitra said she was inspired to bring Iyer to UC Santa Cruz after attending a recent reading of his latest novel, Abandon. The book explores the misconceptions that occur when cultures collide.</p>
<p>"I have long been a fan of his writing" Maitra said. "I've read his books and columns over the years and have attended a number of his readings. He has always impressed me with his kind and gentle approach, and the controlled crisp articulation of his thoughts. The general tone of his novels--an adventurous exploration of different cultures and the certain discovery of intersections between them--is consistent with my vision for the lecture series."</p>
<p>Maitra also selected the film to be screened after Iyer's lecture.</p>
<p>"I have a few favorite Satyajit Ray films," she said. "Last year we showed my absolute favorite--Charulata. This year's film, Devi (The Goddess), is another favorite. It's very complex and full of mystical ideas. It's just a beautiful film."</p>
<p>Sharmila Tagore, one of India's premier actresses, will make her first appearance at UC Santa Cruz to field questions from the audience after the screening of Devi. Although Tagore acted in the 1960 movie when she was just a teenage girl, famed New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael described her role in the film as "exquisite.she is perfect, a word I do not use casually."</p>
<p>"Sharmila Tagore is still one of India's most glamorous stars," Maitra noted. "She is beautiful and charming, intellectually alive, and politically alert."</p>
<p>"I can't wait to see her," Maitra added, "but I'm even more anxious to have a conversation with her."</p>

<p>As in previous years, the Arboretum's plant sale is a joint event with the California Native Plant Society (CNPS). For Arboretum and CNPS members only, the sale starts at 10 a.m. It will take place at the Arboretum's Eucalyptus Grove, on High Street at the intersection with Western Drive.</p>
<p>For gardeners on the Central Coast, fall is an excellent time to get new plants established. The Arboretum offers a wide range of plant selections, including California natives and drought-tolerant plants from Australia and South Africa.</p>
<p>This year's sale will include new Australian plants introduced by the Koala Blooms partnership. This plant introduction program is structured to return some of the profits to the Australian nurseries that developed the plants and some to the Arboretum, which has imported the plants, grown them in trials, and distributed them to nurseries. At least two new introductions, described below, will be available for the first time in the United States at this year's sale.</p>
<p>Verticordia plumosa 'Pink Lace' is a dwarf, rounded, evergreen shrub about 18 to 24 inches tall. It has attractive bluish foliage and lavender-pink, delicately fringed flowers in tight clusters, with a light honey fragrance. This selection blooms profusely in winter and spring. V. plumosa is drought-tolerant and should be planted in a sunny location with good drainage and minimal fertilizer.</p>
<p>Philotheca myoporoides 'Galaxy' is a rounded, evergreen shrub that grows to a height of three to four feet. It has fragrant foliage and pink buds that open into white flowers. With a profuse, showy bloom from fall through spring, it is excellent for landscaping and cut-flower use. P. myoporoides is moderately drought-tolerant and can be grown in any well-drained soil in partial shade to full sun.</p>
<p>An extensive list of plants available at the Fall Sale will be posted on the Arboretum's web site (<a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/arboretum">www2.ucsc.edu/arboretum</a>) by October 1.</p>

Kelso, an assistant professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has received a $150,000 fellowship that will support his efforts to save wild salmon. Kelso today (Monday, September 29) was named a fellow of the Pew Marine Conservation Program, one of only five international recipients recognized each year for their work advancing solutions to the oceans' most pressing problems.</p>
<p>Kelso will be developing policies to protect the wild salmon of the northwest United States from changes in the structure of the salmon industry and proposed new technologies in salmon aquaculture. He will use the funds to address the problems associated with the production of farm-raised salmon and the use of genetically engineered fish in commercial salmon aquaculture.</p>
<p>The Pew Marine Conservation Fellowships are the world's most prestigious awards supporting applied ocean conservation science and outreach. Each fellow receives $150,000 over three years to carry out innovative, interdisciplinary projects addressing challenges facing marine environments around the world.</p>
<p>Alaska is by far the largest producer of salmon in North America, but the rapid and continuing expansion of salmon farming has glutted the world's markets. Prices have fallen so low that the futures of many small-scale fishers and fishing-dependent communities are at risk. Major legislative and regulatory changes under consideration could have unintended socioeconomic and ecological effects, warns Kelso. "Alaska has sustainably managed salmon and their habitats for half a century, but as the tie between human communities and salmon ecosystems is weakened by loss of economic value, the incentives for protecting those ecosystems diminish," said Kelso."</p>
<p>"We are at a crucial moment of change and risk for conservation of salmon, their ecosystems, and the human communities that depend upon them," said Kelso. "Battles for habitat protection, however skillfully waged, may be quickly overtaken by developments that include unintended effects from restructuring commercial salmon fisheries and from the proposed introduction of genetically engineered fish into salmon farming."</p>
<p>Genetic manipulations are easier and often cheaper to achieve in fish than in domestic livestock such as chickens, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is weighing the idea of allowing the commercial aquaculture industry to use Atlantic salmon that have been genetically engineered for faster growth. Some genetically engineered fish have dramatically faster growth rates and achieve market size in roughly half the usual time.</p>
<p>But scientists have identified a number of serious ecological and economic risks and policy concerns associated with genetically engineered salmon that may escape from aquaculture facilities into marine and other aquatic environments, including changes in the ecological fitness of wild fish because of competition and other interactions with escaped fish. Those changes may include gene flow from genetically engineered fish to wild populations. Economic risks include further impacts on the beleaguered wild salmon industry and disruptions of the existing commercial salmon aquaculture industry's structure. Studies have shown that hundreds of thousands of conventionally bred farmed salmon already have escaped from fish cages damaged by storms or predators and because of other operating accidents. Escaped genetically modified fish that breed with wild salmon would create an uncontrolled experiment of nature with unknowable outcomes, warned Kelso.</p>
<p>With his Pew Fellowship, Kelso will develop policy alternatives that focus on two neglected topics. First, despite the United States government's current emphasis on the rights of states, most discussions about managing ecological risks from the proposed use of genetically engineered fish in salmon aquaculture still focus on federal regulation. In fact, the U.S. government now emphasizes deregulation rather than regulatory control of ecological risks. Kelso will look at whether well-constructed and carefully managed state, provincial, and regional regulatory systems can be successful, regardless of whether federal actions are taken.</p>
<p>Second, most proposals to restructure Alaska's salmon fisheries are dominated by considerations of production costs and marketing factors; Kelso will investigate socioeconomic and conservation issues.</p>
<p>A lawyer, social scientist, teacher, and public servant, Kelso brings a broad range of experience to the subject. As Alaska's commissioner of environmental conservation, Kelso directed the state's response when the Exxon Valdez went aground in 1989, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound. He stood up against the reluctant Exxon Corporation to ensure that the spill was cleaned up and to enforce environmental laws. He also represented the state before news media and numerous congressional committees.</p>
<p>As deputy commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game from 1983 until 1986, Kelso worked to preserve salmon habitats, conserve the caribou herd that calves on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and protect migratory waterfowl populations. He also directed the Division of Subsistence from 1980 to 1983, supervising field research on traditional uses of wild, renewable resources in Alaska's rural communities. After obtaining a law degree from Harvard University, Kelso worked early in his career as an assistant public defender in Fairbanks, Alaska, and the IÃ±upiat villages of Alaska's Arctic slope. Kelso earned his Ph.D. in energy and resources from UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>At UCSC, Kelso pursues environmental issues related to genetically engineered organisms, marine resource protection and use, coastal land and water policies, and changes in natural resource industries. He is coeditor of the new book, Engineering Trouble: Biotechnology and Its Discontents, published by the University of California Press, Berkeley (2003) and is working on a manuscript about salmon. Kelso is also coholder of the Pepper-Giberson Chair in Environmental Studies at UCSC.</p>
<p>The four other 2003 Pew Marine Conservation Fellows are Rainer Froese of Germany; Steven Gaines of the United States; Kristina Gjerde of Poland; and Ana Parma of Argentina. More information about all the Pew Fellows is available on the web at <a href="http://www.pewmarine.org">www.pewmarine.org</a>.</p>
<p>The Pew Fellows Program in Marine Conservation seeks to foster greater public understanding of the relationship between life in the sea and life on land. Nominations are made through an international network of environmental experts. Review and selection is conducted by a 12-member international advisory committee based on the applied conservation merit of the proposal, the individual's professional achievement, and the potential impact of the project. The program is an initiative of the Philadelphia-based Pew Charitable Trusts, among the largest philanthropies in the United States, supporting nonprofit activities in the environment, culture, education, health and human services, public policy, and religion.</p>

The donation was accompanied by a grant to establish the position of a Heinlein Scholar at the campus, who will work to organize, document, and promote the scholarly use of the archive, housed in the University Library's Special Collections since 1968.</p>

</tr>
</table>
Often referred to as one of the grandmasters of science fiction along with such colleagues as Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke, Heinlein produced more than 50 novels and collections of short stories over his long career. He became a pop icon in the 1960s with the publication of his book Stranger in a Strange Land, one of the most successful science fiction novels ever published. He also is the author of Starship Troopers, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, and The Puppet Masters.<br/>
<br/>
<p>The Robert Heinlein Archive at UC Santa Cruz contains a priceless collection of the author's original manuscripts, correspondence, and personal effects. The latest acquisition includes all of his honors and tributes including his four Hugo awards, plus artwork and other memorabilia, as well as his extensive working and personal libraries.</p>
<p>William H. Patterson, Jr. has been selected by UC Santa Cruz as the campus Heinlein Scholar for 2003-04. He is founder of the Heinlein Society, a nonprofit educational charity that is dedicated to promoting Heinlein's social legacy. Patterson is also the editor/publisher of The Heinlein Journal and co-author of the book, The Martian Named Smith, a critical study of Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz's head of Special Collections and Archives, Christine Bunting, noted that Patterson is the perfect man for the job.</p>
<p>"He has made documenting Robert Heinlein his life's work," Bunting said. "He was the trusted confidante of Virginia Heinlein and had access to many private documents that only Virginia could provide. And he is well known to Special Collections at UC Santa Cruz, having worked here for the past three years." Patterson is also the person designated by Heinlein's late wife to write the definitive, authorized biography of her husband.</p>
<p>"She called me on New Year's Day, 2001, and asked me to write his biography," Patterson recalled. "I'm actually 180,000 words into it. I hope to finish it by spring of next year, and we'll seek to have it published by a major commercial press."</p>
<p>Although the public can now visit the Santa Cruz campus to view Heinlein's original manuscripts, Bunting said that plans are being made to establish a Finding Aid describing the entire contents of the archive, that will eventually be accessible through the University of California's "Online Archive of California" web site.</p>
<p>"One of our goals is to attract scholarly attention to Heinlein," Bunting explained. "He has a huge popular fan base-there are a large number of web sites and millions of people interested in him. But we think there is another side to him, and we want to provide that."</p>
<p>"He's been lumped academically with science fiction, in the pop culture studies ghetto, but his social impact has always been much broader than science fiction," added Patterson, "particularly with regard to the counterculture in the 1960s, libertarianism in the 1970s, and the Strategic Defense Initiative in the 1980s. You really have to get out of genre studies and into mainstream American literature, going back as far as Upton Sinclair (The Jungle) and Harriet Beecher Stowe (Uncle Tom's Cabin) to find anyone who had a comparable degree of social impact. He really belongs in American studies."</p>
<p>A controversial figure throughout his lifetime, Heinlein often said that his dream was to see humanity settling the other planets of this solar system, and ultimately reaching out to the stars. On the day man first walked on the moon in 1969, he was a guest commentator with Arthur C. Clarke on the CBS television network's live broadcast of the event--hosted by legendary newscaster Walter Cronkite. According to a biographical sketch published by Patterson, Heinlein managed "to reduce Cronkite to a state of spluttering indignation at the suggestion that women should have been included in this mission."</p>
<p>From 1967 until 1987, a year before his death, Heinlein lived in Bonny Doon, a small town in the coastal mountains 15 miles north of Santa Cruz, where Bunting said he built an architecturally unique and futuristic home based on a circular plan.</p>
<p>"Heinlein was a man of eclectic interests," Bunting explained. "He was very much a person of his age, but ahead of his time. He was as much a scientist as a literary figure, and was tremendously influential. One of his position papers ultimately became the core of the Strategic Defense Initiative."</p>
<p>Patterson noted that a new Heinlein book will be published by Simon &amp; Schuster in November.</p>
<p>"It's his very first novel from 1938 about a political utopia," Patterson said. "He put it in his files and later destroyed all the copies, but a friend of his had kept a copy and it was found last year. It's called For Us, The Living."</p>
