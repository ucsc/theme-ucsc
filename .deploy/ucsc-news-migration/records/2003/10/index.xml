Christensen, second chancellor of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a distinguished professor at UC Berkeley for almost four decades, died today (October 2) at his home in Carmel. He served as chancellor from July 1974 through January 1976.</p>
<p>Services are pending for Christensen, who succumbed to cancer at the age of 73.</p>
<p>Prior to his appointment as chancellor of UCSC at the age of 45, Christensen had served as vice chancellor at Berkeley, the principal aide to then-Chancellor Albert Bowker. A member of the Berkeley faculty since 1959, Christensen had received that campus's Distinguished Teaching Award in 1962.</p>
<p>After serving as chancellor at UCSC, Christensen returned to UC Berkeley as a professor of geology and geophysics. He retired in 1994 as a professor emeritus of energy and resources. Upon returning to Berkeley, his research focused on issues of energy, environment, and development, with a special focus on energy conservation and renewable energy resources.</p>
<p>He received a bachelor's degree in geology in 1952 from the University of Alaska and a Ph.D. in geology in 1959 from Berkeley.</p>
<p>Christensen is survived by his wife, Regine Godfrey of Carmel, and two children, Abe Christensen of Berkeley, and Karen Christensen of Felton.</p>

The National Science Foundation (NSF) is providing $17 million over five years to fund the Center for Biomimetic Microelectronic Systems (BMES), a national Engineering Research Center based at USC.</p>
<p>Biomimetics refers to the use of technology to mimic biological systems. BMES researchers are developing prosthetic devices to restore abilities that have been lost due to injury or disease. The center will focus on three "testbed" projects: a cortical prosthesis for implanting in the brain to restore cognitive functions lost due to stroke or other causes; a neuromuscular prosthesis to restore movement to a paralyzed limb; and a retinal prosthesis to provide artificial vision to people who have lost their sight due to diseases affecting the retina, such as retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration.</p>
<p>"This is a most visionary engineering research center, where our faculty members and students will be working hand in hand with faculty at USC and Caltech on exciting, innovative, and critical research. It will lead to wonderful new technology that will be truly beneficial to mankind," said Steve Kang, dean of UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>Kang noted that the work of the new center is at the core intersection of the three broad areas in which UCSC's engineering school is focusing its expertise: information technology, biotechnology, and nanotechnology. The campus will receive about $2.7 million in funding from the center over the first five years. The center may receive NSF support for as long as ten years, after which it is expected to become self-sufficient.</p>
<p>All three of the center's testbed projects share common technological challenges, said Wentai Liu, a professor of electrical engineering and director of the center's activities at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"The basic problems involve power and data management, miniaturization of the microelectronic systems, and the interface technology that allows the microelectronics to interact with living tissue," said Liu, who leads the engineering tasks for the retinal prosthesis project.</p>
<p>Liu has been working for more than a decade on the retinal prosthesis in collaboration with researchers at USC and other institutions. A prototype system has been tested in a small number of patients with promising results. It involves an internal unit that is implanted in the eye and stimulates inner-layer neurons of the retina, and a pair of high-tech glasses that acquire, code, and transmit images over a wireless connection to the implant. Electrical power is also transmitted wirelessly to the electronics in the eye.</p>
<p>The Engineering Research Center (ERC) provides stable, long-term funding for all three testbed projects and for addressing the basic technological challenges they all share, Liu said.</p>
<p>"The ERC enables us to plan long-term research and pursue a coherent interdisciplinary approach to difficult problems," he said.</p>
<p>Michael Isaacson, the Kapany Professor of Optoelectronics at UCSC and another key participant in the center, noted that the center is tackling problems that require collaboration between researchers in a wide variety of disciplines.</p>
<p>"All the exciting stuff is happening at the interface between engineering, biology, and the physical sciences," Isaacson said.</p>
<p>Isaacson has considerable experience doing research at this interface, using technology developed by the semiconductor industry to study biological systems and develop biomedical devices. His work involves developing nanofabrication techniques and imaging tools for making and visualizing devices and structures on the nanoscale (a nanometer is one billionth of a meter).</p>
<p>A major thrust of Isaacson's research has involved making connections between microelectronic devices and the nervous system. For example, he has developed devices that can be implanted into insect brains to record signals from the brain's neural circuits. Information about how the neural circuits work can then be used to develop improved microelectronic devices. This kind of feedback drives what Isaacson calls the nanobiotechnology cycle.</p>
<p>"It goes full circle. We use technology from the semiconductor industry to build a device to learn about a biological system, and then we take what we learn about the biology and apply it to develop a new device," he said.</p>
<p>Being part of this national Engineering Research Center is a significant achievement for the young Baskin School of Engineering, established at UCSC in 1997.</p>
<p>"This represents a quantum jump for the UCSC engineering program," Liu said.</p>

Greenwood announced today (Friday, October 10) that proceeds from the Scholarships Benefit Dinner and associated activities have raised more than $500,000. That figure will increase at the October 11 event, when more than 300 attendees will vie for unique items offered in a silent auction. Proceeds will support scholarships, fellowships, internships, and service-learning opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students.</p>

"The timing for this stunning achievement couldn't be better," Greenwood noted. With the current difficult economy and the rising cost of student fees, many families could not afford to send their children to the university, without scholarships and other forms of financial aid." <br/>
<br/>
<p>Chancellor Greenwood is co-host of the benefit dinner with the <a href="http://foundation.ucsc.edu">UC Santa Cruz Foundation</a> and the <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Alumni Council</a>. "I'm very proud that so many alumni are supporting educational excellence, so that today's students can benefit as we did in our time at UC Santa Cruz," said Foundation president and alumnus Kenneth Feingold, a Los Angeles attorney. "And it is a pleasure to see our trustees stepping forward as well."</p>
<p>Among the table sponsors and major donors are numerous alumni, plus parents of current students and UCSC graduates, Foundation trustees, and other campus friends. Corporate and foundation sponsors include campus partners from Silicon Valley and beyond, including Adobe, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Korea Telecom, Microsoft, the Ford Foundation, the Koret Foundation, and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.</p>
<p>Currently, approximately 60 per cent of UC Santa Cruz undergraduates receive a combination of scholarships, grants, loans, and part-time employment opportunities. In 2002-03, the campus provided financial support for more than 7,300 of its undergraduates, up from 5,700 five years earlier, and the need is growing. The UC Regents increased student fees last year and again this fall in the face of severe budget cuts; UC Santa Cruz is experiencing a 15 per cent increase in financial aid requests for 2003-04.</p>
<p>Private donors support more than 200 scholarship and fellowship funds at UC Santa Cruz. The largest funds include the Alumni Association Scholarship Fund and the Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Awards. The latter, named after UCSC chancellor emeritus, the program's founder, supports $20,000 scholarships for students from the region's community colleges.</p>
<p>Nationally, tuition and fees at private and public universities have more than doubled over the past 20 years, even with inflation taken into account. With many states facing the worst budget crisis in 60 years, fees and tuition at four-year public institutions jumped almost 10 percent between 2002 and 2003, with more dramatic increases expected in the coming year. As a result, students graduate with more debt. At UC Santa Cruz, the average cumulative indebtedness of undergraduates is $13,282.</p>

<p>One of India's premier performers of Hindustani music, Sisirkana will be accompanied by Uttam Chakraborty on tabla and Jyotsana Dutta Roy on tanpura. Sisirkana has performed frequently on All India Radio and Television and is a 1997 recipient of India's prestigious Sangeet Natak Academy award for her contribution to the field of Hindustani classical violin.</p>
<p>Sisirkana is also a visiting professor at the Ali Akbar College of Music in San Rafael, where she serves as director of bowed instruments. She first met Khan in 1956, and has since toured the world, performing in Nepal, Bangladesh, Scandinavia, Russia, Japan, England, and throughout the United States.</p>
<p>"This is a brand-new concert series," noted UCSC music professor Linda Burman-Hall. "It comes out of the generosity of Kamil and Talat Hasan, two Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who have made an endowment for classical Indian music at the campus. They were concerned about a younger generation of Indian heritage students who haven't had the exposure to the musical traditions that their parents experienced. And they also wanted to provide exposure for non-Indian students who may be curious about this wonderful improvisational musical tradition."</p>
<p>The concert series is also funded by the Ali Akbar Khan Endowment for Classical Indian Music, established in 1999 at UCSC. This fund enriches courses in Indian music and has helped make possible the presence on campus of Ali Akbar Khan.</p>
<p>One of the world's most accomplished Indian classical musicians and raga composers, the legendary 81-year-old Khan is revered by jazz, classical, and pop musicians worldwide. He has performed for more than 8 million people, recorded nearly 100 albums, and received numerous awards and honors--including a MacArthur Foundation "Genius" award, four Grammy nominations, and a prestigious National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts.</p>
<p>In 1999, Khan was named Distinguished Adjunct Professor of Music at UCSC. His role on campus is to present occasional concerts, master classes, and workshops, both on his own and with his associates. He also serves as an adviser to the Arts Division in the development of courses and resources in Indian classical music, and helps facilitate the presentation of outstanding guest performers.</p>

This question will be addressed by a panel of speakers at a Forum on Electronic Voting on Sunday, October 26, at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p><p>The forum will take place from 12:30 to 5 p.m. in the Baskin Engineering Building, Room 152, on the UCSC campus. Arthur Keller, visiting associate professor of computer science at UCSC, will moderate the discussion. The event is free and open to the general public. </p><p>The presidential election of 2000 introduced the term "hanging chad" to the American vocabulary and highlighted the shortcomings of punch-card voting systems. In response, the U.S. Congress passed legislation aimed at replacing punch-card voting systems with more reliable technology. One result has been the widespread adoption of touch-screen voting machines. But many computer scientists say these machines have serious problems with respect to security, reliability, and accountability. </p><p>The forum at UCSC will present several perspectives on the current controversy surrounding electronic voting systems. While many computer scientists argue that the results from such systems are unverifiable and vulnerable to tampering, some election officials seem unconcerned. Part of the appeal of electronic voting machines is that they can enable blind and disabled people to vote secretly. Tens of thousands of these voting machines are now being deployed across the United States and will be used to count about 40 percent of the votes in the 2004 presidential election. </p><p>Speakers at the forum will include:</p><p>- David Dill, Professor of Computer Science, Stanford University</p><p>- Warren Slocum, Chief Elections Officer, San Mateo County</p><p>- Joe Simitian, California State Assemblymember, 21st District</p><p>- Alan Dechert, Open Voting Consortium</p><p>- League of Women Voters (invited)</p><p>Several of the participants in the forum maintain web sites with information relating to the issues that will be discussed, including Dill (<a href="http://verifiedvoting.com">http://verifiedvoting.com</a>), Slocum (<a href="http://www.warrenslocum.com">http://www.warrenslocum.com</a>), Dechert (<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~adechert">http://home.earthlink.net/~adechert</a>), and the League of Women Voters (<a href="http://www.lwv.org">http://www.lwv.org</a>).</p><p>The forum is sponsored by the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, the UCSC chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and the UCSC chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery. </p><p>For more information about the forum, contact Robert Kibrick at kibrick@cruzio.com.

The first in what is expected to be a series of public workshops on the LRDP process will be held on the evening of Wednesday, November 5.</p><p>	The workshop will take place from 6 to 9 p.m. in the Sierra and Dawn Rooms at the UCSC Inn, located at 611 Ocean Street in Santa Cruz.</p><p>	Designed to provide a description of the LRDP project, outline the project's process and time line, and introduce the project team, the November 5 workshop will also serve as a first opportunity for people to participate in the development of the long-range plan. "This is an opportunity early on for people to meet our planning team and inform us about the issues and values that need to be considered as we update our LRDP," said Charles Eadie, director of campus and community planning at UCSC.</p><p>	Within the University of California system, LRDPs are drafted to support the academic goals of individual campuses; they also take into account projected statewide enrollment demand.</p><p>	Upon their completion, the long-range plans define a building program and a land-use map that serve as a comprehensive planning framework for capital construction, infrastructure, and land-use programs. LRDPs, however, are not implementation plans, Eadie said, and adoption of an LRDP does not constitute a commitment to specific projects, construction schedules, or funding priorities.</p><p>In addition to holding meetings that will provide opportunities for public input, UCSC's LRDP project team will be working with local agencies as part of the process, Eadie added.</p><p>	The process that is just beginning will produce UCSC's fifth Long Range Development Plan, following plans that were adopted in 1963 (two years before the campus opened), 1971, 1978, and 1988.</p><p>	A major influence on the new LRDP will be ideas that emerge from a parallel campus planning effort: the work of the Strategic Futures Committee, charged with identifying the range of academic and research programs that may emerge in UCSC's future.</p><p>	Campus officials decided to use the year 2020 as the end of the planning horizon because that time frame will be aligned with the city of Santa Cruz's comparable planning document, its General Plan, also soon to be updated. "While our academic goals and the state's higher-education needs are important factors in the development of our physical plan," Eadie said, "we also need to develop a plan that incorporates input from the community."</p><p>	According to a schedule that has been developed by campus officials, during the current academic year the campus's academic vision will be updated and LRDP public workshops will take place. In the 2004-05 year, a draft LRDP will be completed and work will begin on a draft environmental impact report (EIR) for the LRDP. In the 2005-06 year, the draft EIR will be presented to the public for comments, and the LRDP and EIR will be submitted to UC's Board of Regents for final consideration.</p><p>	For more information, call (831) 460-3570.

"With minorities on the jury, prosecutors can't rely on racially stereotyped arguments and nuances. The jury is a very important form of checks and balances in the criminal justice system."</p><p>	Fukurai, coauthor of the 1993 book <I>Race and the Jury: Racial Disenfranchisement and the Search for Justice</I>, uncovered three jury models designed to increase the representation of racial minorities:</p><p>. <b><I>Jury de medietate linguae</I></b>, or "jury of the half tongue." The so-called "split jury," in which half of the jurors come from the majority population and the other half from minority groups, was developed in medieval England when Jews were routinely discriminated against in court. The reform mandated that six of 12 jurors hearing cases against Jewish defendants must be of Jewish descent. Early settlers in the northeastern United States brought the system with them from England, requiring that Native Americans make up half the jurors in cases against Native American defendants.</p><p>	. The <b>Hennepin jury model</b> mandates that the jury's racial representation reflect the proportion of majority and minority groups in the general population.</p><p>	. The <b>social science model</b> requires at least three minority jurors, because researchers have identified that number as the threshhold at which minorities successfully resist the group pressure of the majority in the jury decisionmaking process.</p><p>	A fourth strategy is what Fukurai calls <b>preemptory inclusion</b>, which would give prosecutors and defense attorneys a fixed number of prospective jurors they could select who would be protected from challenge, leaving the remaining slots to be filled through the regular jury selection process.</p><p>	As recently as 1990, the Hennepin model was in use in Minnesota, but it was rejected in 1999 as a racial quota. Anticipating similar criticism, Fukurai points out the widespread use of racial quotas in trade, immigration, and other policies. "This may require the action of one courageous judge who says 'yes,'" concedes Fukurai. "In business and immigration, quotas are everywhere. If there is no discrimination in the future, we may get rid of the numerical goals."</p><p>African Americans and Hispanics are overrepresented as defendants and underrepresented on juries, said Fukurai. "There are 2 million people in jail and prison in this country, and half of them are African American males, who make up only 6 percent of the population," he said.</p><p>Racial bias in police and court procedures makes verdicts suspect, as in the highly charged criminal case against O. J. Simpson. The racially diverse jury dismissed murder charges because the evidence was not credible enough to convict, said Fukurai. "Everybody thinks O. J. did it, and perhaps he did, but you can't have racially biased evidence collection," said Fukurai.</p><p>Racially and ethnically mixed juries would build in a system of "checks and balances," said Fukurai. "If we have members of racial minorities on juries, it affects the way the criminal justice system operates. There's a ripple effect," he said. </p><p>	Fukurai compared the strong animosity that led to the selective prosecution of Jews in medieval England to the treatment of members of the Arab and Islamic communities following the September 11 terrorist attacks.</p><p>	Detainees being held at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay have been denied access to lawyers and have little chance of receiving a fair trial in military court, where six-member juries are made up of three military judges and three select lay members affiliated with the military, trials are conducted out of public view, and trials require only a two-thirds vote for conviction. </p><p>	In the conclusion of their new book, Fukurai and Krooth write:</p><p><blockquote>In the great pendulum swing of history, the political denial of civil liberties and judicial rights of those charged with crimes against social order periodically reemerge. With increasing limitations on habeas corpus and with authoritarian secret trials, those trying to maintain trial fairness and verdict legitimacy need to fall back on tried methods and structures. Juries mixed by race and ethnicity--<I>juries de medietate linguae</I>--may become the prominent emblem of fairness and justice in our time.</blockquote></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d35e88072704601a012fff5486ac2"><name>414</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz executive vice chancellor tapped for presidency; John B.

Greenwood announced today (Thursday, October 16) that John B. Simpson will be appointed as president of the University at Buffalo, the State University of New York by the SUNY Regents at their meeting on October 28. </p><p>"Although John's appointment means a loss to this campus, it is also a compliment to us all that his leadership and achievement here has been recognized by another great university," said Greenwood. Simpson is the first campus chief academic officer in UC Santa Cruz history to rise to a presidency at another major university.</p><p>Among his accomplishments at UC Santa Cruz, Simpson has stimulated active and productive planning exercises, and in the last year has fostered the establishment of an innovative way to address budget cuts through the Executive Budget Committee process. That process aims to establish strategic budget reductions while protecting the academic mission, rather than the more commonly used "across-the-board" budget-cutting tactic.

<p>The Higher Education Recruitment Consortium (HERC)--a group of 18 Bay Area campuses founded in 2000 by UC Santa Cruz--announced today the launch of <a href="http://www.bayareaherc.org">www.bayareaherc.org</a>, the first higher education job web site in northern California. The site is designed for a wide variety of job seekers to have access to thousands of Bay Area higher education jobs--all in one place.</p>
<p>"This represents a tremendous advance for people seeking a career in higher education," noted HERC director Nancy Aebersold. "Before the HERC site was established, job seekers needed to contact 18 different job sites at individual campuses to stay abreast of employment opportunities."</p>
<p>Job seekers have free access to the HERC web site and all of its features, including the "myjobs" area that automatically sends e-mail to potential applicants when jobs are posted that meet their profile. The site is supported by participating campuses that pay annual membership fees as members of the consortium.</p>
<p>At a press conference held today at UCSC Extension in Cupertino, UC Santa Cruz Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood and Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor John B. Simpson joined Stanford University Vice Provost for Faculty Development Pat Jones; San Jose State Associate Vice President of Faculty Affairs Peter Lee; and Foothill/De Anza Community College District Vice Chancellor of Human Resources Jane Enright to celebrate the new web site and the diversity of HERC membership.</p>
<p>HERC's member campuses cover the entire spectrum of higher education, including the University of California, California State University, California Community Colleges, private universities, and professional schools. The consortium draws its members from institutions ranging from Sonoma County to Monterey, and east to Merced. The participants work together to share resources, technology, networking, and outreach programs in order to effectively recruit and retain qualified and diverse employees.</p>
<p>Higher Education represents a significant economic force in the Bay Area. HERC member campuses have a combined overall budget estimated at more than $7 billion with over 20,000 faculty employees and 50,000 staff, administrative, and executive employees. Over the next five years, HERC campuses will hire an estimated 20,000 new employees. In 10 years, that number is expected to double to between 40,000 and 50,000 new employees.</p>
<p>Aebersold noted that higher education is a microcosm of the overall job market.</p>
<p>"Many job seekers may not be aware that higher education offers opportunities for employment in a wide variety of career fields," she said. "In addition to faculty and research positions that are typically associated with higher education, there are also positions for lawyers, nurses, mechanics, engineers, web developers, accountants, psychologists, animal care specialists, medical assistants, and many others that can now all be found at one centralized web location."</p>
<p>Aebersold added that HERC also specializes in helping spouses and partners of faculty and staff find jobs in the Bay Area, where dual incomes are often a necessity in order to afford the high cost of living.</p>

The new results from an analysis of sediment cores from the ocean floor are consistent with theoretical predictions of how Earth's climate would respond to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The new study, led by James Zachos, professor of Earth sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will be published online by Science Express on October 23, and will appear in a later print edition of Science magazine.</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed sediments deposited on the seafloor during a period known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, when a massive release of heat-trapping greenhouse gases is thought to have triggered a runaway process of global warming. Climate theory predicts that the increase in greenhouse gases would have caused temperatures to rise all over the planet, with greater increases in sea surface temperatures at high latitudes than at low latitudes.</p>
<p>Zachos and a team of researchers at UCSC and several other institutions have now obtained the first reliable estimates of the change in tropical sea surface temperatures during this period. When combined with existing records of sea surface temperatures at high latitudes, the findings fit well with the predictions of computer simulations based on current climate theory.</p>
<p>The study provides important backing for the climate models that scientists are using to predict the effects of the current rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide due to industrial emissions, Zachos said.</p>
<p>"The predictions from the models seem to be consistent with the geologic record, so I'd say greenhouse climate theory is alive and well," he said. "People have raised questions about how accurate these models are in terms of handling heat transport in response to rising greenhouse gases, but this study indicates that the climate people have got it right or close to right."</p>
<p>The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, starting about 55 million years ago and lasting about 150,000 years, is marked by dramatic changes in the fossil record of life in the ocean and on land. Average global temperatures increased by about 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit). The increase in sea surface temperatures at high latitudes was 8 to 10 degrees Celsius, and the new study shows a 4- to 5-degree Celsius increase in tropical sea surface temperatures.</p>
<p>"This event is the best example of greenhouse warming in the geologic record, and for the first time we have been able to document the climate response on a relatively broad planetary scale, from the tropics to polar latitudes," Zachos said.</p>
<p>The temperature estimates were derived from chemical analyses of the shells of microscopic plankton preserved in the seafloor sediments. The chemical composition of the plankton's calcite shells reflects the temperature of the water in which they were formed. A key measurement examined in this study was the ratio of magnesium to calcium, which increases exponentially with the temperature at which the shells formed.</p>
<p>"The ratio of magnesium to calcium in seawater is relatively constant over the timescale of this event, so the ratio in the shells is really only sensitive to one variable, the calcification temperature," Zachos said.</p>
<p>UCSC graduate students Michael Wara and Steven Bohaty performed most of the chemical analyses. The researchers analyzed sediment cores recovered from a site called Shatsky Rise in the tropical Pacific during an expedition of the ship JOIDES Resolution in 2001 (Leg 198 of the Ocean Drilling Program). The cores provided a complete sequence of deposits representing the boundary between the Paleocene and Eocene epochs.</p>
<p>"There aren't many places in the Pacific where you can recover sediments of this age in which the fossils are not so recrystallized that they've lost their original geochemical signatures," Zachos said.</p>
<p>ODP Leg 198 and a complementary drilling expedition in the Atlantic earlier this year (ODP Leg 208) were designed to test the leading explanation for the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, which attributes it to a massive release of methane. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, accumulates in frozen deposits known as clathrates found in the deep ocean near continental margins and also in the Arctic tundra. For reasons that remain unclear, the clathrates suddenly began to decompose, releasing an estimated 2,000 gigatons (2 trillion tons) of methane.</p>
<p>Once released, the methane would have reacted with dissolved oxygen in the ocean to produce carbon dioxide, another greenhouse gas. Large amounts of both carbon dioxide and methane would have entered the atmosphere, raising temperatures worldwide.</p>
<p>In addition to Zachos, Wara, and Bohaty, the coauthors on the Science paper are Margaret Delaney, professor of ocean sciences at UCSC, Maria Rose Petrizzo and Isabella Premoli-Silva of the University of Milan, Amanda Brill of the University of North Carolina, and Timothy Bralower of Pennsylvania State University. Bralower and Premoli-Silva were co-chief scientists on ODP Leg 198.</p>

Doyle, professor emeritus of biology and founder and long-term director of UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS). </p><p>Doyle was largely responsible for the establishment of the Joseph M. Long Marine Laboratory, which officially opened in 1978 with two research buildings, a seawater system, and outdoor pools for marine mammals. The William T. Doyle Research Building, formerly known as the Research Support Building, features laboratories with running seawater, analytical instrument rooms, research offices, and support spaces for marine mammal research. It remains one of the lab's core research buildings. </p><p>Doyle's early leadership laid the foundation for what is today a nationally recognized, multifaceted center for research and education in marine science. In recent years, Long Marine Lab has added new facilities, including the Center for Ocean Health, a state-of-the-art research building that opened in 2001, and the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, where exhibits, lecture series, and education programs make the work and discoveries of marine scientists accessible to the public. State and federal research agencies have also built facilities adjacent to the lab.</p><p>"The development of the marine lab in recent years has been remarkable," Doyle said. "They have accomplished many of the things that I and the other early planners only talked about doing. They're doing world-class science, and the interaction with other agencies and environmental groups is just wonderful."</p><p>Doyle, who graduated from Watsonville High School in 1947, was one of the founding faculty members of UC Santa Cruz when the campus opened in 1965. He was intimately involved in the planning and development of the marine science program at UCSC and served as chair of the Campus Planning Committee on Marine Studies from 1970 to 1972. His vision and energies led to the establishment of the Center for Coastal Marine Studies as an Organized Research Unit in 1976. </p><p>The late Kenneth Norris, a pioneering marine mammal researcher and outstanding teacher, came to UCSC in 1972 and headed the marine program until 1975. Doyle again took on the leadership of the program in 1975 and served as director of the Center for Coastal Marine Studies (renamed the Institute of Marine Sciences in 1983) from its establishment in 1976 until his retirement in 1991.  </p><p>"We were very fortunate to have two early directors, Bill Doyle and Ken Norris, who were both true visionaries and also worked really hard to make things happen," said Gary Griggs, current director of the IMS. </p><p>"[Doyle] saw the opportunity here and recognized that this was a great place to develop a marine science program. And then it took a lot of hard work and persistence and raising of private money to get it done," Griggs said.</p><p>Daniel Costa, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology who was one of the first researchers to work with marine mammals at Long Marine Lab, said Doyle played a crucial role in the development of his career and in the careers of many other young researchers at the lab. </p><p>"He's been incredibly influential," Costa said. "He knew what kind of support we needed and he always figured out a way to make things happen when you needed something."</p><p>Not a marine scientist himself, Doyle is a terrestrial botanist specializing in a relatively obscure and little studied group of nonflowering plants known as liverworts and hornworts. He still maintains an active research program at UCSC, looking at the distribution and kinds of these plants in California. </p><p>As the campus's marine science program developed, however, Doyle and his students delved into various areas of marine botany, with research projects on the ecology of marine algae and marine algal mariculture. Among the graduate students Doyle advised were Julie Packard, now executive director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and Andrew DeVogelaere, research coordinator for the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. </p><p>Doyle received his B.A. and Ph.D. in botany from UC Berkeley. He spent five years on the faculty of Northwestern University in Illinois before coming to UCSC as a founding faculty member. In addition to his leadership of the marine science program, he served as dean of the Division of Natural Sciences from 1980 to 1983. He also served for two terms as chair of the Department of Biology, and served as deputy and acting provost during the early development of Oakes College. </p><p>Doyle is a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences.

UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering now has programs leading to M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in bioinformatics, in addition to the B.S. degree that has been available for undergraduates since 2001.</p>
<p>UCSC is now the only UC campus and one of just seven universities in the country to offer all three degrees in bioinformatics (B.S, M.S., and Ph.D.). A number of students who plan to earn graduate degrees in bioinformatics are already enrolled at UCSC. There are currently 20 graduate students in computer science who will transfer into the new graduate program in bioinformatics.</p>
<p>"We had 170 applicants for the bioinformatics graduate program last year, before it was formally approved," said Kevin Karplus, professor of computer science. "It is a very competitive program. Our acceptance rate for domestic students was 15 percent, and for foreign students it was 3 percent."</p>
<p>UCSC has developed one of the top bioinformatics research programs in the country under the leadership of Karplus, David Haussler, professor of computer science and director of UCSC's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE), and professor of computer engineering Richard Hughey. The CBSE has spearheaded the development of collaborative research and education programs in bioinformatics and other areas, bringing together faculty from different disciplines in engineering and the physical and biological sciences.</p>
<p>Karplus said the graduate program in bioinformatics is looking for students with at least some background in both computer programming and biology. Programming experience is especially valuable, because it is not an easily acquired skill, he said.</p>
<p>UCSC's bioinformatics program focuses on tool building--creating new software programs and methods for analyzing and organizing data generated by research in molecular biology and biochemistry. The increasing use of "high-throughput" techniques in these fields is generating vast amounts of data, and advanced computational techniques are needed to extract useful information from such huge datasets.</p>
<p>"Our focus is on producing the tools that are needed to answer interesting questions in biology," Karplus said.</p>
<p>In the past, graduate students at UCSC who were interested in bioinformatics have earned degrees in related fields, such as computer science. Several UCSC alumni have been highly successful in the field. David Kulp, for example, who studied computer science under Haussler, helped start a biotechnology company based on software initially developed at UCSC for finding genes within genome sequences. The company, Neomorphic, was later acquired by Affymetrix, and Kulp is now on the faculty of the University of Massachusetts - Amherst.</p>
<p>The UCSC Genome Browser is one of the world's most popular bioinformatics tools, providing a web-based portal for the scientific exploration of the human genome sequence and the genomes of a growing number of other organisms. The browser was developed by James Kent, now a CBSE research scientist, while he was a graduate student in molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UCSC. The genome browser web server at UCSC now receives about 140,000 page requests a day from scientists in dozens of countries.</p>
<p>"Our current strengths are in the areas of comparative genomics, gene finding, DNA microarrays, and protein structure prediction. We expect to continue to grow and expand, but we're not trying to do everything," Karplus said.</p>
<p>The engineering school is currently in the process of establishing a new Department of Biomolecular Engineering, which will administer the bioinformatics program once the new department is approved.</p>
