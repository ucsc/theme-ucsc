<p>Launched in 2007 to celebrate the spirit of community that resulted in the founding of a University of California campus in Santa Cruz, the event recognizes and honors extraordinary individuals and their outstanding contributions to society.</p>
<p>This year's featured honorees will be:</p>
<p><strong>Arthur D. Levinson and J. Michael Bishop (UC Santa Cruz Foundation Medal):</strong> Arthur D. Levinson, chairman and former CEO of Genentech, and J. Michael Bishop, University Professor and Chancellor Emeritus at UCSF, will be honored for their distinguished careers in biomedical research and biotechnology.</p>
<p><strong>Hal Hyde (Fiat Lux Award):</strong> Hal Hyde, UCSC's first vice chancellor of business and finance, will be honored for his central role in the founding of UC Santa Cruz and his long history of service to the campus and support for its programs and goals.</p>
<p><strong>Julia Sweig (Alumni Achievement Award):</strong> Award-winning historian and author Julia Sweig (Porter '86) will be honored for her influential writing on Latin America and U.S. foreign policy.</p>
<p><strong>Steven Vogt (Faculty Research Lecturer):</strong> Steven Vogt, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, will be honored for his groundbreaking discoveries of planets outside our solar system.</p>
<p>The evening will include a celebratory dinner, awards presentation ceremony, and video tributes to each of the award recipients. The dinner's honorary co-chairs will be UCSC Chancellor Emeritus Robert Sinsheimer and William A. Lee, senior vice president of research at Gilead Sciences, Inc.</p>
<p><strong>Arthur D. Levinson</strong> is the chairman and former CEO of Genentech. He began working at Genentech in 1980 after holding a postdoctoral position with J. Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus in the Department of Microbiology at the University of California, San Francisco. Following Genentech&#8217;s $47 billion merger with Swiss drug maker Roche in 2009, Levinson left day-to-day operations and is leading Genentech's new board of directors and steering the integration of the company into Roche.</p>
<p><strong>J. Michael Bishop</strong> is an American cancer scientist who received the 1989 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine along with his colleague Harold Varmus. He is a University Professor and Chancellor Emeritus at UCSF. Working together in the 1980s, Bishop and Varmus demonstrated for the first time that normal genes can be converted into cancer genes. Their findings opened a path to understanding how cancer arises and how it might better be controlled.</p>
<p><strong>Hal Hyde</strong> is a central figure in the founding of UC Santa Cruz. After serving on a committee helping the University of California select a Central Coast location for a new campus, Hyde became UCSC&#8217;s first vice chancellor of business and finance. He held the position from 1964 to 1975. Hyde oversaw creation of UCSC's infrastructure, including the siting of campus roads and construction of the first colleges, residence halls, and administrative buildings. He also served as the first president of the Arboretum Associates and as a trustee of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Julia Sweig</strong> (Porter '86, Latin American studies) is an internationally recognized authority on Latin America and U.S. foreign policy, especially with respect to Cuba. An award-winning historian and prolific writer, Sweig's most recent book is <em>Cuba: What Everyone Needs to Know.</em> Her writing also appears in the <em>New York Times, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the Financial Times, Foreign Affairs,</em> and a host of international publications. She is researching a political biography about the people behind Brazil's new global footprint.</p>
<p><strong>Steven Vogt,</strong> professor of astronomy and astrophysics, has designed, built, and used high-precision spectrometers to find new worlds outside our solar system during his 33 years with UCSC. In 2010, Vogt and a team of planet hunters announced the discovery of an Earth-sized planet orbiting a nearby star at a distance that placed it squarely in the middle of the star's "habitable zone," where liquid water could exist on the planet's surface. Further observations are needed to confirm the discovery, which remains controversial.</p>

<p>The lecture will take place at 5:30 p.m. in UCSC&#8217;s Humanities 1 Building (room 210). Admission is free and open to the public. A reception will follow at 6:30 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
Moore will speak on the topic: &#8220;Among the Missing: Operations in Recovering Bodies,&#8221; based on her recent book <em>Missing Bodies: The Politics of Visibility (Biopolitics: Medicine, Technoscience, and Health in the 21st Century)</em>.<br/>
<br/>
We know more about the physical body&#8212;how it begins, how it responds to illness, even how it decomposes&#8212;than ever before. Yet not all bodies are created equal, some bodies clearly count more than others, and some bodies are not recognized at all.<br/>
<br/>
By examining the cultural politics at work in disappearances and inclusions of the physical body, Moore shows how the social, medical and economic consequences of visibility can reward or undermine privilege in society.<br/>
<br/>
Moore is also the co-author of <em>Gendered Bodies: Feminist Perspectives, The Body Reader: Essential Social and Cultural Readings</em>, and <em>Gender and the Social Construction of Illness</em>.<br/>

<p>A galactic adventure game with several innovative features, <em>Syz: EG</em> was created by a team of 10 UCSC students as their senior project for the year-long game design studio course. In June, they won the grand prize in the Baskin School of Engineering's <a href="https://games.soe.ucsc.edu/2011-sammy-award-winners">2011 Sammy Awards</a> for the best student games.</p>
<p>Three members of the team then founded <a href="http://teamkrinoid.com/">Team Krinoid</a>, an independent game development company based in Santa Cruz, which has issued <em>Syz: EG</em> as its first release. John Peters, who was lead programmer for the student team and is now CEO of Team Krinoid, said most of the work since June has involved setting up the company and preparing legal contracts so that all of the team members can earn royalties from sales of the game.</p>
<p>"Every once in a while I'd sit down and fix a couple of bugs, and we also added some free play at the end of the game. But other than that, the game is what we created as students," said Peters, who formed the company with team members Peter Hunter and Max Weinberg.</p>
<p>Jim Whitehead, professor of computer engineering and one of the teachers of the game design studio course, said he was impressed by how polished the game was for a student project. "It looked like a game you would buy from the Apple store. It booted up in a professional way, the game play was polished and smooth, and the quality of the graphics was high," he said. "On top of that, it had some notable innovations in game design."</p>
<p>One innovation is the game's use of the iPad's multi-touch screen to control weapons. <em>Syz: EG</em> belongs to the popular "space shooter" genre pioneered by the iconic arcade game <em>Space Invaders,</em> but unlike other space shooters, the weapons are not limited to shooting in the direction the ship is pointing. The player can control where the weapons direct their fire using two fingers on the iPad's multi-touch screen.</p>
<p>The game also has a story line with multiple characters, following Captain Russel Porter and his intrepid crew as they battle the Fringe Republic. "This first release is the pilot episode of our story," Peters said. "It lasts 40 minutes, like a TV show, and introduces all the characters, and we plan to do episodic releases of new games that will continue the story."</p>
<p>Hunter, who graduated in June with a B.A. in literature, wrote the story, including all of the dialogue, and also wrote the music for the game. Weinberg, who earned his B.A. degree in art, did all of the artwork for the game. Seven other students, in addition to Peters, worked on the computer programming: Jonathan Fotland, Lindsey Freeman, Lakota Lefler, Kevin Murphy, Alex Portnoy, Hosh Tachmuradov, and Lucas Thornsberry.</p>
<p>During the development of the game, the students received valuable feedback not only from their professors and teaching assistants, but also from professional game developers who visited the class. Veteran game developer <a href="http://www.graemedevine.com/">Graeme Devine</a>, for example, was able to offer the perspective of a former head of Apple's iPhone Game Technologies division. "He saw our game very early in development and assured us that our control scheme was intuitive and fun to use, even though it had not been seen before," Peters said. "Hearing praise from people in the industry that we looked up to really helped us stay motivated and put in the long hours needed to have a polished and professional game."</p>
<p>For now, the Team Krinoid founders are working out of their bedrooms and hoping that sales of <em>Syz: EG</em> will give them enough funding to set up an office in Santa Cruz. Peters is working on a side project with UCSC astronomer Jonathan Fortney to create an iPad app that will simulate the orbits of newly discovered planets using data from NASA's Kepler mission.

<p>With energies exceeding 100 billion electron-volts (100 GeV), the surprising gamma-ray pulses were detected by the VERITAS telescope array at the Whipple Observatory in Arizona and reported by an international team of scientists in a paper in the October 7 issue of <em>Science</em>. Corresponding author Nepomuk Otte, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said that some researchers had told him he was crazy to even look for pulsar emission in this energy realm.</p>
<p>"It turns out that being persistent and stubborn helps," Otte said. "These results put new constraints on the mechanism for how the gamma-ray emission is generated."</p>
<p>Otte, Andrew McCann of McGill University in Montreal, and Martin Schroedter of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory performed most of the analytic work for the study, which involved nearly 100 scientists in the VERITAS collaboration. VERITAS spokesperson Rene Ong, professor of physics and astronomy at UCLA, credited Otte as the leading advocate for using the powerful gamma-ray observatory to study the Crab pulsar.</p>
<p>"To me it's a real triumph of the experimental approach, not going along with the flow and making assumptions, but just observing to see what there is. And lo and behold, we see something different than what everybody expected," Ong said.</p>
<p>The Crab pulsar is a rapidly spinning neutron star, the collapsed core of a massive star that exploded in a spectacular supernova in the year 1054, leaving behind the brilliant Crab Nebula, with the pulsar at its heart. It is one of the most intensively studied objects in the sky. Rotating about 30 times a second, the pulsar has an intense, co-rotating magnetic field from which it emits beams of radiation. The beams sweep around like a lighthouse beacon because they are not aligned with the star's rotation axis. So although the beams are steady, they are detected on Earth as rapid pulses of radiation.</p>
<p>Scientists have long agreed on a general picture of what causes pulsar emission. Electromagnetic forces created by the star's rapidly rotating magnetic field accelerate charged particles to near the speed of light, producing radiation over a broad spectrum. But the details remain a mystery.</p>
<p>"After many years of observations and results from the Crab, we thought we had an understanding of how it worked, and the models predicted an exponential decay of the emission spectrum above around 10 GeV. So it came as a real surprise when we found pulsed gamma-ray emission at energies above 100 GeV," said coauthor David Williams, adjunct professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz and a member of the VERITAS collaboration.</p>
<p>Prior to these new results, a phenomenon known as curvature radiation was the leading explanation for the Crab's pulsed gamma-ray emission. Curvature radiation is produced when a high-energy charged particle moves along a curved magnetic field. But according to Otte, this mechanism cannot account for gamma rays with energies above 100 GeV.</p>
<p>"The conventional wisdom was that the dominant mechanism is curvature radiation. But the VERITAS results have shown that there must be a different mechanism at work," Otte said. "Curvature radiation can explain the lower-energy emission, but we really don't know what causes the very high-energy emission."</p>
<p>One possible scenario may be a process known as inverse Compton scattering, which involves energy transfer from charged particles to photons. "That seems to be a more likely scenario now, but we still don't know the details of how this works," Otte said. It is also not clear whether one mechanism dominates at all gamma-ray energies, or if curvature radiation dominates at lower energies and something like inverse Compton scattering dominates at higher energies.</p>
<p>According to Ong, researchers will need to characterize the very high-energy gamma-ray emission in much greater detail in order to gain more insight into the mechanisms behind it. "We need to take more measurements and get the exact shape of the spectrum at these very high energies," he said.</p>
<p>The VERITAS observations open up a new avenue for testing Einstein's theory of special relativity, which says that the speed of light is a universal constant. One of the predictions of a quantum theory of gravity, which emerges from efforts to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity, is that the speed of light actually may have a small dependence on the energy of the photon. This would be a violation of "Lorentz invariance," which is at the core of special relativity, but it might be detectable in the VERITAS data, Otte said. Photons with a range of energies are emitted by the pulsar at the same time. If photons with different energies travel at different speeds, the effect would manifest itself as a slight shift in the position of the pulses at different energies.</p>
<p><a href="http://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/">VERITAS</a> (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System) is a ground-based observatory for gamma-ray astronomy located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in southern Arizona. It is an array of four 12-meter optical reflectors, used to record Cherenkov radiation created by high-energy gamma-ray showers in the atmosphere. These imaging Cherenkov telescopes have maximum sensitivity in the energy range from 100 GeV to 10 TeV (10,000 GeV or 10 trillion electron volts).</p>

<ul>
<li>December 23, 26, 30 and January 2 are paid university holidays (if eligibility criteria are met)</li>
<li>December 27, 28, and 29 are not paid university holidays</li>
</ul>
<p>These curtailment days may result in employees using vacation, accrued compensatory time off, or leave without pay for December 27, 28, and 29, 2011. For employees who may not have sufficient accumulated vacation, up to three (3) days of vacation leave may be used in advance of actual accruals during the campus curtailment period. In addition, those employees normally required to wait six (6) months before using accrued vacation will be allowed to use their accrued vacation hours even if the required waiting period has not been completed.</p>
<p>Due to the diverse responsibilities of academic appointees and the flexibility in performing their obligations, it is anticipated that some academic appointees will continue working during campus closure.</p>
<p class="Default">Units planning to maintain operations as usual during the campus curtailment period must receive approval from their respective Principal Officer or designee and should refer to the &#8220;Exceptions to Campus Closure&#8221; memo that will be forthcoming from Physical Plant in November. This memo will explain the required procedure to ensure that heat is supplied to appropriate working areas.</p>

Casey Moore, professor emeritus of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the development of geology in Japan.</p>
<p>Moore contributed the prize money (100,000 yen) back to the Geological Society of Japan to support the organization's earthquake recovery efforts in the aftermath of the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. He was honored at an award ceremony and gave a special lecture during the society's fall meeting at Ibaraki University in September.</p>
<p>"Through many years of interaction with Japanese scientists, I have received much generosity and thoughtful consideration. For me, this is the real reward that goes with the recognition of the International Prize," Moore wrote in an acceptance letter to Sumio Miyashita, president of the Geological Society of Japan.</p>
<p>Moore has worked with Japanese scientists since 1973, when he investigated the seafloor around Japan as part of the Deep Sea Drilling Project. In subsequent years, he contributed to the development of marine geology in Japan through his participation in the Ocean Drilling Program and the current Integrated Ocean Drilling Program. In particular, he has been involved in ongoing studies of the Nankai Trough, a subduction zone where the Philippine Sea Plate dives beneath Japan. Moore's research focuses on the structural geology of subduction zones and the active margins of continental plates.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dade8f9a8072704601e3753d16366fb3"><name>green-move-in-sustainability-ucsc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC steps up 'zero waste' projects </title><summary>UCSC staff and students started off the school year by recycling a whopping 38,840 pounds of cardboard within the first two weeks of the fall quarter.

<p>"That&#8217;s over 300 trees," said Elida Erickson, sustainability coordinator for the UCSC Sustainability Office. &#160;"Pretty cool, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, 960 pounds of &#8220;plastic film&#8221; packaging material and three large bins of Styrofoam were collected for recycling. A local company will compact the Styrofoam and sell the pieces to another company that will use the material to make picture frames.&#160;</p>
<p>The campus was able to pull off this feat because of a carefully coordinated effort.&#160;For the first time this fall, the UCSC Sustainability Office stepped in to organize a campus-wide eco-friendly move-in during Welcome Week, with help from Erickson.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="http://sec.enviroslug.org/">Student Environmental Center</a> coordinated &#8220;Zero Waste&#8221; efforts at the Office of Physical Education, Recreation and Sports (OPERS) Fall Festival, which attracted thousands of students in late September. The festival, a chance to connect with student media, sports and recreation clubs, the Student Union Assembly, and other organizations, has turned into the biggest &#8220;Zero Waste&#8221; special event on campus.</p>
<p>"There are so many opportunities for students to get involved (with waste reduction), especially this year,&#8221; said UCSC sustainability director Aurora Winslade.</p>
<p>Last year, the nonprofit Ecology Action had a grant to work throughout the campus for a reduced-waste move in, but this is the first year that the <a href="http://sustainability.ucsc.edu/">Sustainability Office</a> stepped into this role, supervising the project in conjunction with UCSC&#8217;s physical plant and housing facilities.</p>
<p>"There was a big push this year to meet our waste-diversion goals, which is why I was here to fill that gap,&#8221; Erickson said.</p>
<p>During move-in week, every college at UCSC had "cardboard corrals" where students could recycle cardboard containers and reduce move-in waste. Colleges also had bins to collect Styrofoam and plastic for recycling.</p>
<p>UCSC has also been encouraging students to choose carefully when deciding what to bring to campus, and to avoid bringing products that come with excessive packaging.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s&#160; green-friendly move-in builds on UCSC&#8217;s existing reputation as an environmentally conscious university, with a number of recent awards for green building practices, and a new but already influential student-run Carbon Fund, which helps launch carbon-reduction projects on and off-campus. UCSC&#8217;s efforts have been recognized by the Sierra Club, which recognized the campus as the seventh "coolest"&#160; school its most recent ranking -- it second recent showing in the Top 10.</p>
<p>UCSC already has a well-established <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/06/UCSC-zero-waste-moveout.html">&#8220;Zero Waste Move-Out&#8221;</a> system across the campus, making it easy for students to deposit household goods, electronics and other materials in collection bins before taking off for the summer.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the nonprofit organization Ecology Action, UCSC has been diverting more than 60 percent of its waste from landfills. For the eco-friendly move-out, the campus partners with agencies that can use, sell or redistribute the house wares, toiletry items and electronics, giving them new life while keeping them out of the landfill. Those organizations include H.O.P.E. Services, Goodwill, Second Harvest Food Bank, and Homeless Services of Santa Cruz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dba100a38072704601e3753d81f49488"><name>varian-lecture</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Google chief economist kicks off finance lecture series at UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>Hal Varian, chief economist at Google and a UC Berkeley emeritus professor, is the inaugural speaker of a quarterly lecture series being launched by a new financial and economic risk-analysis initiative at UC Santa Cruz.&#13;

<br/>
Varian's lecture, &#8220;Predicting the Present with Google Trends,&#8221; will take place October 20, 2011 at 2 p.m. in the Alumni Room of University Center on the UCSC campus. It is free and open to the public.<br/>
<br/>
Varian will show how search queries from Google can help improve forecasts of the current level of activity for many different economic events, including automobile sales, home sales, retail sales, and travel behavior.<br/>
<br/>
He is an emeritus professor in the School of Information, the Haas School of Business, and UC Berkeley's Economics Department. Varian is also a fellow of the Guggenheim Foundation, the Econometric Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and has published numerous articles on economic theory, industrial organization, financial economics, and information economics.<br/>
<br/>
Varian's talk is the first public event by the Sury Initiative for Global Finance and International Risk Management (SIGFIRM), a new interdisciplinary initiative at UC Santa Cruz that addresses challenges in global financial markets brought by increased uncertainty, globalization, and the use of information technology. The initiative was founded with a seed grant by Sharath Sury, a UCSC economics graduate who later became a successful money manager.<br/>
<br/>
The lecture series is organized by Thomas Wu, an assistant professor of economics at UCSC. Each quarter, SIGFIRM will invite a leading figure who has contributed to the fields of economics and finance both as a researcher and a practitioner to deliver a public lecture on a topic of major significance to students, faculty, and professionals.<br/>
<br/>
SIGFIRM co-directors are Manda Sury, a respected researcher in computational finance and an active financial trading firm manager, and UCSC economics professor Nirvikar Singh, an expert on the Indian economy and other emerging markets who also serves on the Indian Finance Minister's advisory group on G20 matters.<br/>
<br/>
According to the co-directors, the series will contribute to SIGFIRM&#8217;s goal of bringing together researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to solve real-world problems of finance. These include risk management, the need for robust tools for financial decision-making, and policymaking in a globalized financial system.<br/>
<br/>
The scheduled speaker for winter quarter is Terrance Odean, the Rudd Family Foundation Professor of Finance at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="df195cb58072704601e3753dc6b99aed"><name>world-university-rankings</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC ranked third in research influence in world university survey</title><summary>In an analysis of the world's top universities, UCSC ranked third in research influence.</summary><keywords>rankings, citation impact, Times Higher Education, World University Rankings</keywords><start-date>1317974400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC ranked third in research influence</display-name><path>/2011/10/world-university-rankings</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/10/world-university-rankings</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1318002973767</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1324503598948</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/10/images/logo.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/10/images/logo.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>logo.jpg</name><display-name>logo.jpg</display-name><file-size>50100</file-size><width>302</width><height>220</height></image><image-alt>Times Higher Education logo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/10/images/logo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/10/images/logo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>logo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>logo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23072</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In a recent analysis of the world's top universities, UC Santa Cruz ranked third in research influence as measured by the number of times its published work is cited by academics.</p>
<p>Published as part of the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2011-2012, the <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2011-2012/top-400.html#score_CI%7Csort_ind%7Creverse_false">analysis</a>, conducted by Thomson Reuters, measured overall research influence based on a normalized average number of citations per research paper. The data were aggregated over a six-year period and normalized to reflect variations in citation volume between different subject areas and other factors.</p>
<p>With a citation score of 99.9, UC Santa Cruz ranked behind only Princeton University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (both with top scores of 100). Three other universities--the California Institute of Technology, UC Santa Barbara, and Rice University--also had citation scores of 99.9, followed by Stanford and Harvard at 99.8.</p>
<p>The average number of citations per paper, known as citation impact, is a widely used measure of research performance. When researchers publish an article in a scientific journal, they must cite previous papers by other authors that set the stage for their work. Generally, a paper that describes important findings or ideas and influences the work of other researchers receives more citations than less influential papers.</p>
<p>UCSC has been highly ranked in similar surveys in the past that have focused on particular fields of research.

<br/>
To help distribute SCMTD transit capacity to riders boarding along the Laurel, Mission and Bay corridors during the busiest morning transit commute times, the weekday 7:38am Route 15 bus now starts service at Laurel and Blackburn (as of October 6), rather than at the Metro Center. Similarly, on Tuesdays and Thursdays only, the 9:30am Route 15 and the 9:35am Route 16 start service at Laurel and Blackburn.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Due to mechanical problems last week, Metro had to use several Highway 17 buses on UCSC routes. These commuter buses have significantly less standing room than the buses with perimeter seating normally used for campus service; unfortunately this reduced the capacity of the system, resulting in many people being passed by at Metro stops. The regular buses are now back in operation, increasing capacity and reducing pass-bys.<br/>
<br/>
TAPS will continue to monitor SCMTD service during peak travel times, and work with Metro staff to pursue additional service improvements where possible.

<br/>
Crow and co-authors Brent Swallow, of the University of Alberta, Canada, and Isabella Asamba, from Kisumu, Kenya, found that women invest their freed-up time in income-generating activities such as raising seedlings for coffee and tea growers in the region or raising livestock.</p>
<p><strong>Ph.D. student killed</strong></p>
<p>The authors' findings are the result of research into community-organized water projects begun in western Kenya more than seven years ago by UCSC Ph.D. student Jessica Roy who was struck and killed by a car while walking in Nairobi in 2004.<br/>
<br/>
At the time, Roy was one of his graduate students, said Crow, the current chair of UCSC's Sociology Department. The World Development article credits Roy with initiating the research and laying the groundwork for the methodology that Crow and his colleagues used.<br/>
<br/>
Community organization to build pipes from springs into rural homesteads, the paper suggests, leads to significant improvements in people's lives. Government and international development could support similar village water projects. Roughly 1 billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water. In rural Kenya, only 10 percent of the population has access to improved water supplies, according to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p><strong>Sociologist, computer scientist collaborate</strong></p>
<p>In a related study this past summer, Crow and UCSC computer science professor James Davis looked at water-collection activities in two urban slums in Kenya. They collaborated by affixing GPS devices to water cans women use to transport water. They then download the collected data and overlay it on maps to plot the distance, frequency, and time commitment involved.<br/>
<br/>
In the first study described in World Development, Crow and his co-authors found that whether a community undertakes a water project often depends on the nature of relations between men and women. Although women had more time to pursue other activities when water was piped to a village, men actually tended to have less free time because they were more likely to be involved in the community effort to improve water access.<br/>
<br/>
A typical community water project might take two to five years. "It's quite an undertaking," Crow said. The community must raise money, buy pipe and perhaps a storage tank. Then comes the effort to lay the pipe.</p>
<p><strong>Ten trips on laundry day</strong></p>
<p>Crow said women walk 200 to 1,000 meters several times a day to and from springs in the hilly area carrying jerry cans that weigh approximately 44 pounds when full of water. Ten trips might be needed on laundry day, four or five on other days.&#160; The effort can take up to four hours a day.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Crow and the others surveyed seven communities with three types of water sources -- protected springs, unprotected springs, and piped water from protected springs. Protected springs have a concrete structure built over them with an outflow pipe or faucet that protects the water from animal or other contamination.<br/>
<br/>
They found that incomes generally rose after a community piped water to its homestead. "In three to five years we can see changes in income data," Crow said.<br/>
<br/>
The research was funded by grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X11002075</url><title>Article in World Development </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e00687268072704601e3753df7b44f67"><name>danm-call-for-apps</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Digital Arts and New Media MFA program—call for applications</title><summary>UCSC's Digital Arts and New Media MFA program is accepting applications for fall 2012 now through January 3, 2012. </summary><start-date>1317974400000</start-date><display-name>DANM MFA call for applications</display-name><path>/2011/10/danm-call-for-apps</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/10/danm-call-for-apps</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1318018516685</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1320364625624</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/10/images/danm_call4apps12.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/10/images/danm_call4apps12.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>danm_call4apps12.jpg</name><display-name>danm_call4apps12.jpg</display-name><file-size>29210</file-size><width>300</width><height>426</height></image><image-alt>DANM call for applicants art</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>UCSC's Digital Arts and New Media MFA program is accepting applications for fall 2012 now through January 3, 2012. <br/>
<br/>
The campus's unique location&#8212;on the beautiful Monterey Bay, immediately south of Silicon Valley&#8212;allows our faculty and students to take advantage of opportunities such as participation in ZER01, a multi-disciplinary, multi-venue biennial festival of visual and performing arts at the intersection of art, technology, and digital culture. <br/>
<br/>
The two-year DANM MFA program brings together faculty and students from across the academic spectrum to pursue interdisciplinary artistic and scholarly research. The diverse curriculum includes collaborative research project groups, where small clusters of students work with professors on artistic, technical, and theoretical research in one of four focused areas: Mechatronics, Participatory Culture, Performative Technologies, and Playable Media. Current project group leaders include such notable faculty as Brandin Baron-Nusbaum, Kate Edmunds, Newton and Helen Meyer Harrison, Jennifer Parker, Noah Wardrip-Fruin, and David Yager.<br/>
<br/>
Core and elective courses in the theory and practice of digital media arts support the development of individual thesis papers and projects premiered in the program's annual MFA Exhibition. The MFA is a terminal degree in the field of Digital Media Arts, qualifying graduates for a variety of career paths including university-level teaching and public- and private-sector research.<br/>

During a year in which state support for UCSC declined by $31 million, total giving to the campus jumped nearly 10 percent&#8212; from just over $20 million in 2009-10 to $21.9 million in 2010-2011.</p>
<p>UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal said he was heartened by this year&#8217;s increase in giving. "This outpouring of support makes me even more optimistic about the campus&#8217;s future," he said. &#8220;Private giving is more important than ever, and these gifts make a real difference to our students, our programs, and our research endeavors."</p>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Contributions from parents of current and former students increased from $718,000 to $998,000.</li>
<li>Contributions from faculty increased from $575,000 to $1.76 million.</li>
<li>The total number of alumni gifts increased from 3,299 to 3,574.</li>
<li>Gifts included $940,404 in realized bequests.</li>
<li>Contributions for student support rose from $1.6 million to $2.8 million, an increase of almost 300 people who designated their gifts for student support.</li>
<li>Total unrestricted giving rose from just over $1 million last year to $1.2 million this year.<br/>
<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Major Gifts</strong></p>
<p>Some of the largest individual donations this year came from philanthropists Jack and Peggy Baskin, who pledged $1 million to the Jack Baskin and Peggy Downes Baskin Fellowships for engineering students; Deborah Seymour, who gave $500,000 to the Seymour Marine Discovery Center Endowment, in celebration of the center&#8217;s 10th anniversary; and the W.M. Keck Foundation, which gave $1 million to UCSC's Electrical Engineering Department. In addition, the Hellman Fellows Fund pledged $625,000 to establish a Hellman Fellows Program, which will provide research support to junior faculty in all fields of study.</p>
<p><strong>New Avenues for Private Giving</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remembering Gabe Zimmerman</strong>: Over 450 donations ranging from $10 to $5,000 poured into UCSC to honor alumnus Gabe Zimmerman, 30, a congressional staffer killed in the January shooting spree that wounded his boss, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz. A fundraising effort, begun by two UCSC graduates days after Zimmerman&#8217;s death and enhanced by social media such as Facebook, quickly raised over $50,000 to fund an endowed scholarship in Zimmerman&#8217;s name. UCSC alumni made forty percent of those gifts; the cause attracted many new donors, most of whom used the campus&#8217;s improved online donation system.</li>
<li><strong>Student Donors</strong>: UCSC student groups continued to support the campus. The Senior Class of 2011 raised money for a student-controlled legacy gift and for the first time, awarded four scholarships from the money they raised, demonstrating how students are helping other students.</li>
<li><strong>Planned Giving:</strong> A substantial $7.3 million, not included in UCSC's overall giving total, was pledged in planned gifts. Twelve new individuals revealed their plans for including the campus in their estate plans and ten members of the 21st Century Club, UCSC's legacy society, shared details of their bequest intentions. In addition, two irrevocable charitable gift annuities were created.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Celebrating 45 Years</strong></p>
<p>Campus milestones also motivated donors. &#8220;Forty-five years after our first students arrived, UCSC has matured into one of the world's great universities while retaining the fundamental character envisioned by its founders," said Blumenthal. This year also marked the 30th anniversary of Shakespeare Santa Cruz and the 25th anniversary of UCSC&#8217;s famous banana slug mascot.</p>
<p>"Gifts from alumni and from our own faculty and staff are making an important impact at UC Santa Cruz this year," said Donna Murphy, vice chancellor of University Relations at UCSC. "The gifts not only strengthen our programs. They also are a dramatic statement of the importance of the work and educational opportunities the campus provides."</p>
<p>"This campus is rich with programs that benefit society as well as programs that give our students exceptional opportunities to create knowledge and to learn," Murphy added. &#160;&#8220;Every gift is a vote of confidence and makes a lasting difference."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e032a7938072704601e3753dd59d70eb"><name>gear-up-grants</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Educational Partnership Center receives $14 million in federal outreach grants</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz's Educational Partnership Center has been awarded two GEAR UP federal grants to serve students in Pajaro Valley and South Monterey County.</summary><keywords>UC Santa Cruz, GEAR UP grants, Educational Partnership Center</keywords><start-date>1317974400000</start-date><display-name>Educational Partnership Center</display-name><path>/2011/10/gear-up-grants</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/10/gear-up-grants</link><created-by>jrburns</created-by><created-on>1318021408579</created-on><last-modified-by>jrburns</last-modified-by><last-modified>1318221425007</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Curt Anderson</name><title></title><phone>831-459-2451</phone><email>curt@uccollegeprep.org</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/10/images/epc.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/10/images/epc.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>epc.jpg</name><display-name>epc.jpg</display-name><file-size>18259</file-size><width>72</width><height>72</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz's Educational Partnership Center has been awarded two GEAR UP federal grants to serve students in Pajaro Valley and South Monterey County. The grants will fund UCSC's outreach to local underserved students and amount to a little over $2.3 million annually for both grants and close to $14 million dollars over the next six years.</p>
<p>"The GEAR UP College Access programs are vital to our efforts to support lower-income students in their aspirations of joining the University of California," said Richard Hughey, vice provost and dean of undergraduate education. "I am particularly excited about UCSC&#8217;s opportunity to work with regional schools and to help students explore the possibilities of advanced education and student research on our campus."</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Education received 262 eligible partnership applications, funding only 47 applications, 9 of which were in California.&#160;In total the federal government released $177.4 million for 66 grants under Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) that will help some 275,000 at-risk students to prepare for college and receive the support they need to achieve success in postsecondary education.</p>
<p>"We know innovative programs like GEAR UP that intervene early can make all the difference in whether young people go to college,&#8221; U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan&#160;said. "These grants provide the mentoring, support, and financial aid that will give thousands of students a greater opportunity to achieve success in postsecondary education."</p>
<p>The grants will help fund student advising, tutoring, financial aid, college field trips and other college-going activities.&#160; It also includes professional development for teachers as they adopt new classroom strategies proven to help students learn more effectively.&#160;The grants continue EPC&#8217;s particular focus on working with parents and families to create environments and support to help underserved, predominantly Latino students, reach UC or another college or University.</p>
<p>"The GEAR UP grants allow the campus to provide significant outreach to underserved students in need of help," said Rafael Granados, interim executive director of EPC. "The grants allow us to provide resources to help students and their parents gain a foothold on the path to college eligibility, which is especially important in these times of limited school resources."</p>
<p>Catherine Cooper, a professor in UCSC's Psychology Department, will serve as faculty liaison with other UCSC faculty and the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and will consult with the project and district leaders on adapting the assessment metrics as a planning tool for creating college-going cultures in and across school sites. She comes to the project from Bridging Multiple Worlds Alliance (BMWA), a network of state, national and international researchers, educators, and policymakers who work to open access to education from preschool through graduate school.</p>
<p>"We are looking forward to working with our partners in these schools and districts to widen the impact of these grants and help us create a college-going community for students and their families," said Maria Rocha-Ruiz, director of the GEAR UP programs at EPC. "This support allows us to build on the foundation of work already achieved in schools where our staff have already made significant impact."</p>
<p>Rodney Ogawa, professor of education and faculty director of UCSC's Center for Educational Research in the Interest of Underserved Students (CERIUS), will serve as the external evaluator for the project.</p>
<p>The funds are provided by the college access program GEAR UP, a federally funded program designed to help prepare middle and high school students for college.&#160;The competition during this round was extremely competitive with a little less than 18% of applicants receiving awards.</p>
<p>The Educational Partnership Center, now a program of the UCSC Undergraduate Education division, currently oversees three grants in the region, including a grant in North Monterey County which is in its final year of funding.&#160; In 2009-2010, EPC served 2,559 students in the three areas. EPC plans to apply for another round of funding for the North Monterey County area next year and so continue to provide uninterrupted support for local schools in need.</p>
<p>EPC currently has about 50 staff, many working at high schools in these regions, as well as additional staff involved in other outreach and academic prep programs, such as EAOP, MESA, COSMOS, Transfer Partner Program, California Reading and Literature Project and UC College Prep, as well as a program, CalSOAP, serving Santa Clara County.&#160; In 2009, the Educational Partnership Center merged with UC College Prep to provide online and on the ground assistance to underserved students.</p>

K. H. Panofsky Prize in Experimental Particle Physics to William Atwood, adjunct professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The award recognizes Atwood "for his leading work on the design, construction, and use of the Large Area Telescope on the Fermi Gamma-ray Satellite, enabling numerous new results in gamma-ray astrophysics and fundamental physics."</p>
<p>Atwood played a central role in the conception and development of Fermi's Large Area Telescope (LAT). The LAT is one of two instruments onboard Fermi and is the most sensitive and highest-resolution gamma-ray detector ever launched. The <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/main/index.html">Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope</a>, formerly called GLAST, is an international and multi-agency space observatory that studies the cosmos in gamma-rays, the most energetic form of light.</p>
<p>At UCSC, Atwood is a member of the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP). SCIPP researchers led by UCSC physicist Robert Johnson developed the LAT's tracker and electronics. SCIPP director Steven Ritz, who served as project scientist for Fermi and is currently deputy principal investigator for the LAT, has been involved in the project since 1996.</p>
<p>"Thanks to Bill's pioneering work, along with the efforts of thousands of people worldwide, Fermi has been a great scientific success," Ritz said. "In just these first three years, Fermi has given us surprises and new insights across a wide variety of topics. Its discoveries include dozens of pulsars observed to pulse only in gamma rays, powerful flares from the Crab nebula, enormous gamma-ray-emitting bubbles near the center of our galaxy, breakthrough results on the origin and propagation of cosmic rays, important new constraints on dark matter and tests of fundamental physics, and more. And the best is yet to come!"</p>
<p>The Panofsky Prize will be presented to Atwood at an awards ceremony at the APS meeting in Atlanta in April 2012. Atwood will also give an invited talk at the meeting. The prize was established in 1985 by friends of W. K. H. Panofsky, director emeritus of the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, and the APS Division of Particles and Fields, Stanford University, and SLAC. Awarded annually to recognize and encourage outstanding achievements in experimental particle physics, the prize consists of $10,000, a travel allowance, and a certificate.</p>
<p>Atwood also received the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/01/atwood-rossi.html">2011 Bruno Rossi Prize</a> from the American Astronomical Society in recognition of his contributions to the Fermi space telescope.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="eed515e680727046003d1fa22adbda97"><name>ucsc-in-the-news-10-10-11</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>TIME magazine turned to psychology professor Craig Haney for observations about support from families of people released from prison in connection with the Amanda Knox case. </summary><start-date>1318233600000</start-date><display-name>ucsc-in-the-news-10-10-11</display-name><path>/2011/10/ucsc-in-the-news-10-10-11</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/10/ucsc-in-the-news-10-10-11</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1318266934676</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1318286850202</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong><em><a href="http://healthland.time.com/2011/10/05/amanda-knox-mom-and-dad-how-parents-are-hard-wired-to-help/">TIME magazine</a></em></strong> turned to psychology professor Craig Haney for observations about support from families of people released from prison in connection with the Amanda Knox case.

<p>Both professions require craft, discipline, and vision, but those qualities are not enough. Physicians and writers must have sympathetic imaginations. They must project themselves into the hearts and minds of others.</p>
<p>That's why Dr. Abraham Verghese &#8212;a physician and the author of best-selling novel <em>Cutting for Stone</em>&#8212;places such a premium on listening to patients, making bedside visits, and performing thorough examinations.</p>
<p>But Verghese, who delivered the 11th annual Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture to a capacity crowd at UCSC's Music Center Recital Hall, worries that a constant emphasis on medical technology and computerized diagnostics is distancing doctors from patients, making sick people worry that they are being treated as diseases, data, or "iPatients," the human equivalent of iPhones and iPods.</p>
<p>"The iPatient is getting wonderful care across America, while the real patient is wondering, 'where the hell is everyone, who is in charge, and who is caring for me?" said Verghese, professor for the Theory and Practice of Medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine and senior associate chair of the Department of Internal Medicine.</p>
<p><em>Cutting for Stone,</em> Verghese's first novel, is now in its 87<sup>th</sup> week on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list.</p>
<p>To further illustrate his point, Verghese imagined an alien from outer space visiting a modern-day medical center and wondering if the doctors believe their patients' bedsides are "toxic," or if the purpose of admission into a hospital "is to render a 3D human into a 2D image."</p>
<p>Later, Verghese joked that if you were to enter a hospital missing a limb, "no one would believe you unless you got a CAT scan diagnosis."</p>
<p>What's missing, he says, is the old-fashioned, intimate ritual of the bedside visit.</p>
<p>Verghese argues that this kind of medical practice is not only soul-fulfilling for patients and doctors alike; he also believes it's more effective. By rekindling the excitement of medical care, and the personal connection to patients, doctors will be more attentive, committed, and thorough in their work, he believes.</p>
<p>Besides, he added, when doctors perform these rituals, they actually save time and money by eliminating the need for unnecessary tests.</p>
<p>"I'm not a Luddite," he explained. "I love technology, but the doctor's presence, his tone of voice, his concern&#8212;all these things have an effect."</p>
<p><strong>Breaking down barriers</strong></p>
<p>Verghese's resume is impressive. He holds an MD from Madras Medical College in India and an MFA from the prestigious University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. This self-described perpetual outsider was born to Indian parents in Ethiopia, where his medical training began. He served as a resident at a hospital in Johnson City, Tennessee, where he returned after completing a fellowship at the Boston University School of Medicine.</p>
<p>After developing his patient-care philosophy, he found a platform for these beliefs when he became the founding director of the Center for Medical Humanities &amp; Ethics at the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, prior to taking his position at Stanford.</p>
<p>Along the way, his publishing credits brought him even more attention than his medical achievements. In Tennessee, his experience caring for AIDS patients changed his life and inspired the nonfiction book <em>My Own Country: A Doctor's Story.</em> Another nonfiction book, <em>The Tennis Partner,</em> tells the story of a friend and colleague struggling with drug and sex addiction.</p>
<p>Verghese attributes much of his success in both realms to his emphasis on intimacy, human stories, and telling details.</p>
<p><strong>Journey toward <em>Cutting for Stone</em></strong></p>
<p>Ritual and empathy can be found at the heart of <em>Cutting for Stone,</em> which charts the journey of two brothers who are destined to be surgeons.</p>
<p>Early in the novel, one of his characters speaks out about the emotional risk that the best doctors must face day by day, along with the healing&#8212;and sometimes devastating&#8212;effects of that risk: "Few doctors will admit this, certainly not young ones, but subconsciously, in entering the profession, we must believe that ministering to others will heal our woundedness. And it can. But it can also deepen the wound."</p>
<p>It's easy to imagine that Verghese was speaking through his character. His own medical journey has led him to a similar combination of fulfillment and heartache. Indeed, he has called his own career "a passionate quest, a romantic pursuit," and "a privileged yet hazardous undertaking."</p>
<p>Along the way, Verghese has used writing as an act of discovery and exploration that feeds into his medical philosophies.</p>
<p>Although he's enjoying great success as a writer, he still thinks of himself as "all doctor." In an informal dialogue before the lecture with fiction writer and UCSC literature professor Karen Tei Yamashita and Science Communication Program director Robert Irion, Verghese insisted that his medical work was "not a day job. It's a great privilege."</p>
<p>Addressing a small group of Science Communication students, Verghese likened his writing to a "research program" that reinforces his medical philosophies. "It's not like I didn't want good things to happen to my novel, but it could take its sweet time. I've got a good job, something I love."</p>
<p>The Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture was an appropriate venue for Verghese and his message. The lecture series was established by Anuradha Luther Maitra in memory of her husband, Sid, a scientist, entrepreneur, and admirer of the work of late Indian film director Satyajit Ray. The lecture is sponsored by the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, and is one of the cornerstone events of UCSC's annual <a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/founders/">Founders Celebration</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f9f8a60980727046003d1fa2733fd105"><name>cyber-security-with-google</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>National Cyber Security Awareness Month: Google Apps is Coming Nov. 2011</title><start-date>1318406400000</start-date><display-name>cyber-security-with-google</display-name><path>/2011/10/cyber-security-with-google</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/10/cyber-security-with-google</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1318453814690</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1318453853600</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Campus Updates</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong>Cyber security with Google</strong></p>
<p>This week&#8217;s Cyber Security Month article is about cyber security with Google. As UCSC looks forward to moving faculty and staff email to Google in November, ITS is pleased to share information about enhanced security features with Google, plus some cyber security reminders.</p>
<p><strong><em>Enhanced security features with Google:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Google has better spam and virus filtering than UCSC could provide on CruzMail</li>
<li>Google gives you the ability to check for suspicious activity on your account, such as locations (e.g. cities) from which your account has been accessed</li>
<li>Google supports optional two-factor authentication for added account security</li>
<li>On the technical side, Google undergoes significant independent audits and certifications of their security practices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Google is great for mobile devices!</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With UCSC moving to Google, it is increasingly likely that people will use non-UC devices, especially mobile devices, for work</li>
<li>All devices used for work must meet UC &amp; UCSC security requirements</li>
<li><strong>Tips for protecting mobile devices:</strong> <a href="http://its.ucsc.edu/security/stay-secure/minreq/mobile.html">http://its.ucsc.edu/security/stay-secure/minreq/mobile.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Good security practices still apply:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Email security:</em></strong> Remember that email is inherently neither private nor secure. This is true for our campus email systems as well as most third-party email providers, including Google. Highly sensitive information should never be sent through email unless it is protected, e.g. by encryption. This includes attachments.</li>
<li><strong><em>Protect our most sensitive information:</em></strong> Highly sensitive information should be stored on UC servers designed for its storage or should be encrypted. Attachments containing highly sensitive information should be encrypted. Google does not encrypt documents, so be sure to encrypt your docs before putting them in Google. 
<ul>
<li>And remember to securely delete highly sensitive information when you no longer have a business need to keep it. The less you have to store, the better!</li>

<p>Led by astronomers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, the new study examined the morphology and structure of distant galaxies hosting active central black holes. The researchers found that these galaxies were no more likely to be involved in an ongoing merger than non-active galaxies of similar mass.</p>
<p>"Theoretical models show that a merger is a great way to trigger an active galactic nucleus, because it funnels a lot of gas to the center of the galaxy. But we found that most of the host galaxies did not look disturbed. They look like disk galaxies, and a disk would be destroyed by a merger," said Dale Kocevski, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz and first author of a paper on the findings to be published in the <em>Astrophysical Journal.</em></p>
<p>A supermassive black hole (millions or even billions of times the mass of the sun) sits at the core of most if not all large galaxies. But only a fraction of these are the bright radiation sources known as active galactic nuclei, which light up when the central black hole is actively gobbling up nearby gas clouds. The galactic center glows brightly at all wavelengths because the gas heats up as it falls into the black hole and emits intense radiation.</p>
<p>"The problem has been how to get the gas into the center of the galaxy, rather than orbiting around in the disk," said coauthor Sandra Faber, University Professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The study used new images from Hubble's WFC3 infrared camera taken as part of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS). Faber, who leads the CANDELS project, said the images include galaxies at distances of nearly 11 billion light years. Looking deep into space gives astronomers a window back in time, revealing earlier stages in the evolution of the universe. This study covered a period when the brightest active galaxies, known as quasars, were at their peak, and theoretical models predicted that galaxy collisions would be an important trigger, Faber said. "Theory says that collisions should be more important, but we did not find that," she said.</p>
<p>These are not the first findings to suggest that violent galactic mergers are not needed to fuel active black holes. Earlier imaging studies of galaxies at distances of up to 8 billion light years had also failed to find evidence that mergers were triggering most active galactic nuclei. More recently a team of astronomers reached the same conclusions based on an analysis of the distribution of active galaxies out to almost 11 billion light years. But only Hubble's WFC3 could provide images showing the morphologies of galaxies at that distance.</p>
<p>"We were surprised to see that they look a lot like galaxies much closer to us," Faber said.</p>
<p>If galaxy collisions are not responsible for triggering active galactic nuclei, it suggests less violent processes within galaxies may play a greater role in feeding black holes, Kocevski said. "We call these secular processes. They happen randomly about ten percent of the time and are common in the local universe, such as when a star or a giant gas cloud gets too close and falls into the black hole."</p>
<p>Alternatively, the black holes may be fueled by a process that is unique to the early universe.&#160; "Recent theories suggest distant galaxies are fed by streams of cold gas, which can lead to violent instabilities in disk galaxies that result in large amounts of gas being funneled to the central black hole," Kocevski said. "Only with further study will we know for sure."</p>
<p>Kocevski and Faber worked with an international team of scientists from 21 institutions on the study, which was supported by NASA through a grant from the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). The paper's 38 coauthors are affiliated with UCSC, STScI, Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, Imperial College of Science, Johns Hopkins University, University of Michigan, Durham University, Laboratoire AIM Paris-Saclay, University of Nottingham, Hebrew University, University of Edinburgh, University of Maryland, National Observatory of Athens, University of Massachusetts, Carnegie Institution of Washington, University of Arizona, National Optical Astronomy Observatories, University of Missouri, UC Riverside, Institut de Ciencies del Cosmos, Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.</p>
<p><strong>About CANDELS</strong></p>
<p>The Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) is a powerful imaging survey of the distant universe being carried out with the Hubble Space Telescope. It is the largest project in the history of Hubble, with 902 assigned orbits of observing time. CANDELS makes use of the near-infrared WFC3 camera and the visible-light ACS camera. Together, these two cameras give unprecedented panchromatic coverage of galaxies from optical wavelengths to the near-infrared. The power to look deeper into space and further back in time will enable CANDELS to construct a "cosmic movie" of galaxy evolution that follows the life histories of galaxies from infancy to the present time. This work will cap Hubble's revolutionary series of discoveries on cosmic evolution and bequeath a legacy of precious data to future generations of astronomers. CANDELS will also test the reality of cosmic dark energy by measuring the brightness of type Ia supernovae.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fe53809080727046003d1fa24ebb031e"><name>review-fall-2011-masthead</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Masthead</title><summary>Credits for the fall 2011 Review</summary><start-date>1318492800000</start-date><display-name>Fall 2011 Review masthead</display-name><path>/2011/10/review-fall-2011-masthead</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/10/review-fall-2011-masthead</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1318526877750</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenm</last-modified-by><last-modified>1318526877750</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong>UNIVERSITY</strong><br/>

<p>The UCSC project, "Screening for cholera biofilm inhibitors," is competing against projects from the other campuses in the QB3 consortium, UC Berkeley and UCSF. A panel of expert judges--drawn from the biotech industry, venture capitalists, academia, and the media--narrowed the field from 40 nominees down to the final five. Now, the winner of the $10,000 prize will be determined "American Idol" style, by online voting open only to UC students, faculty, and staff. (Vote online at <a href="http://qb3.org/research/deloitte-qb3-award-innovation">qb3.org/research/deloitte-qb3-award-innovation</a>.)</p>
<p>The UCSC team consists of Kelly Peach, a graduate student in chemistry and biochemistry; Nicholas Shikuma, a graduate student in microbiology and environmental toxicology; and Walter Bray, a research specialist in the UCSC Chemical Screening Center. They developed a screening procedure to identify compounds that can stop cholera bacteria from forming antibiotic-resistant biofilms.</p>
<p>Many bacteria that cause infections and disease, including those that cause cholera, are known to form biofilms. These tough aggregates of bacteria are resistant to traditional antibacterial treatments and to attacks by the immune system. Although biofilms are involved in 60 percent of all human bacterial infections, there are no commercially available therapies for preventing biofilm formation. Peach, Shikuma, and Bray have developed the first high-throughput, image-based assay for cholera biofilm inhibitors. The assay, which can be performed in one day, streamlines the process of identifying inhibitors and will provide compounds that could be used as coatings for medical implants or as components of antibiotic cocktails.</p>
<p>Peach works with Roger Linington, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry, whose research group focuses on marine microorganisms as a source of natural products for drug discovery efforts. Shikuma works with Fitnat Yildiz, associate professor of microbiology and environmental toxicology, whose research focuses on cholera bacteria and the role of biofilms in seasonal epidemics of cholera. Bray, who earned an M.S. in molecular, cell and developmental biology at UCSC, manages the operations of the <a href="http://chemscreen.ucsc.edu/">Chemical Screening Center</a>, where advanced robotic systems are used to search for biologically active compounds with potential for fighting diseases or other uses.</p>
<p>The winner of the Award for Innovation will be announced at an awards ceremony on October 27. The deadline for voting is Wednesday, October 26.</p>
<p>QB3 is a consortium of three UC campuses that fosters collaborations among scientific faculty to enhance innovation and discovery. QB3 is collaborating with Deloitte in the institute's efforts to convert bioscience innovation into a driver for jobs, companies, and better health in California.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fe75dcc980727046003d1fa2791839e7"><name>review-fall-2011-chancellor-note</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>From the chancellor</title><start-date>1318492800000</start-date><display-name>From the chancellor</display-name><path>/2011/10/review-fall-2011-chancellor-note</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/10/review-fall-2011-chancellor-note</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1318529129531</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1321405239091</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/10/images/chancellor.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/10/images/chancellor.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>chancellor.jpg</name><display-name>chancellor.jpg</display-name><file-size>8109</file-size><width>198</width><height>301</height></image><image-alt>Chancellor Blumenthal</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>(Photo: Paul Schraub)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Great and important things are happening at UC SantaCruz.

He was a pioneer in veterinary echocardiography at Cornell University, where he was a professor of veterinary medicine.<br/>
<br/>
A brain tumor took his life at 39, when I was just 11. In quiet moments, I sometimes remember Uncle Gary and wonder how much richer life might have been with him in it.<br/>
<br/>
Cancer has touched nearly everyone. The American Cancer Society estimates that this year alone more than 1.6 million people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with the disease.<br/>
<br/>
Researchers at UC Santa Cruz are at the forefront of the search for new ways to defeat this devastating disease. As you'll read in our cover story, Distinguished Professor of Biomolecular Engineering David Haussler and his team are working toward the goal of personalized cancer diagnosis and treatment, which would be an enormous advance in cancer medicine.<br/>
<br/>
Other articles in this issue show how UCSC achieves its public service mission by helping supply California with qualified math and science teachers, is opening new doors of understanding to world history, and is working to bring more primary care doctors to communities with underserved populations.<br/>
<br/>
UCSC alumni also entertain: One is now a TV executive involved in producing provocative hit shows including <em>Mad Men</em> and <em>Weeds;</em> another is editor-in-chief of a news magazine that examines issues from an unusual angle.<br/>

For the Banana Slug's earliest fans, rallying behind the mollusk was a mischievous gesture, a thumb in the eye of the status quo.<br/>
<br/>
These days, 25 years after it became the campus's official mascot, Sammy the Slug could not be more accepted and beloved. All of the Banana Slug paraphernalia now available can make people forget that this mascot's future once hung on a slender thread of slime.<br/>
<br/>
This year, alumni are pausing to reflect on those days in the mid-1980s, when backers of the then-unofficial UCSC Banana Slug mascot prevailed after a disagreement with campus community members who favored a sea lion mascot.<br/>
<br/>
The Banana Slug mascot story is all about perseverance, creativity, and daring to be different in a world of boring, run-of-the-mill animal mascots.<br/>
<br/>
"The banana slug just suited the campus so well&#8212;its symbiotic relationship with the redwoods and its nonviolent Gandhi-an characteristics," said Marc Ratner (Cowell '87, linguistics).<br/>

<p>It may be hard to believe, but Shakespeare Santa Cruz has been thrilling audiences for three decades now. The theater company opened its latest season this past summer at the Mainstage Theater with one of the most successful productions in SSC's history, <em>The Comedy of Errors,</em> directed by award-winning UC Santa Cruz theater arts professor, and former SSC artistic director, Danny Scheie.</p>
<div class="callout-right"><img alt="Shakespeare Santa Cruz former artistic director Danny Scheie on the set for a special run of Comedy of Errors at Villa Montalvo." height="257" src="images/scheie-danny.jpg" width="300"/>

</div>
<p>"Danny's original production remains to this day a favorite of SSC audience members, and is a great celebration of our history," observed Artistic Director Marco Barricelli, who just completed his fourth summer festival at SSC.</p>
<p>Founded in 1981, Shakespeare Santa Cruz is a professional repertory companyin residence at UCSC. It has been celebrated by USA Today as "one of the nation's top ten most influential" Shakespeare companies.</p>

</div>
<p>UCSC's undergraduates have reason to be proud of their sustainability efforts this year. This summer, a "green" delegation including undergrads Gabi Kirk and Cameron Fields (pictured) went to Taiwan to lead a green workshop. Students also launched a Carbon Fund to pay for eco-friendly projects on and off campus and convened a far-ranging Campus Earth Summit.</p>
<p>The all-student organized summit, this year the 10th annual, brought together students, faculty, staff, and community members to share ideas and strategize on how to transform UCSC into a sustainable campus.</p>
<p>Visiting the Earth Summit on Earth Day this year was a contingent from the University of Hawaii's West Oahu campus, who were looking for sustainable ideas as they build out their campus.</p>

<h2>Turning inward with adaptive optics</h2>
<div class="callout-right"><img alt="Joel Kubby with one of his adaptive optical systems." height="252" src="images/kubby-joel.jpg" width="255"/>

</div>
<p>For the last 30 years, astronomers have used adaptive optics to get a clearer look at outer space. Now, UC Santa Cruz biologists are harnessing the same technology to get a better look at living cells and tissues, giving them a fuller picture of human biology and diseases.</p>
<p>Funded by a $1 million grant from the W. M. Keck Foundation, the new W. M. Keck Center for Adaptive Optical Microscopy at UC Santa Cruz builds on efforts begun in 2006 by a group of biologists, astronomers, and optical engineers.</p>
<p>Principal investigator Joel Kubby, an associate professor of electrical engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UCSC, has worked on adaptive optics systems for large telescopes as well as for biological imaging. In astronomy, AO systems correct the blurring of telescope images caused by turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere. In microscopy, blurring is caused by the flowing cytoplasm of living cells.</p>

<p class="caption">An example of a tagged ocean predator.</p>
</div>
<p>A 10-year study involving UC Santa Cruz ecology and evolutionary biology professor Daniel Costa provides a remarkable picture of top marine predators' movements, migration patterns, and critical habits across the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Two big regions of the North Pacific Ocean are magnets for marine life, attracting a diverse array of predators in predictable seasonal patterns, according to results from the Tagging of Pacific Predators project published in <em>Nature</em> in June.</p>
<p>The California Current, which flows southward along the U.S. West Coast, and the North Pacific Transition Zone, a boundary between cold subarctic water and warmer subtropical water, are both hot spots for large marine predators, the study found. "These are the areas where food is most abundant, and it's all driven by high primary productivity at the base of the food chain&#8212;these areas are the grasslands of the sea," said Costa, co-author of the report.</p>

</div>
<p>William Doyle, a founding faculty member of UC Santa Cruz when the campus opened in 1965, has written a book that traces the early history of the campus. <em>UC Santa Cruz: 1960&#8211;1991</em> begins with the story of how the campus came to be located in Santa Cruz and describes the challenges of designing and building the new campus.</p>
<p>Doyle, a professor emeritus of biology, held many important administrative positions during his years at UCSC. He is best known for his leadership in the planning and development of the marine science program at UCSC, and several chapters of the book are devoted to those efforts.</p>
<p>In a foreword to the book, Chancellor George Blumenthal wrote that Doyle "was indeed a pioneer, who arrived at a nascent campus with almost no buildings, no academic programs, and very few faculty. His own commitment to the campus led to a string of developments and contributions that spanned his entire career."</p>

<p class="caption">Dave Rawlings and Gillian Welch (Photo: Mark Seliger)</p>
</div>
<p>Forty-five seconds into the new Gillian Welch CD, <em>The Harrow and the Harvest,</em> you realize this is the real deal.</p>
<p>It's a low-key affair&#8212;in the best possible way&#8212;with exquisite musicianship, haunting harmonies, and superlative songwriting. It's also the first Gillian Welch album to come out in nearly eight years.</p>
<p>After the album's release, the UCSC alumna (Porter '90, art) embarked on national tour with longtime musical partner David Rawlings.</p>
<p><em>The Harrow and the Harvest</em> marks Welch's fifth CD in 15 years. It features nine new songs, plus a studio version of the stunning <em>The Way It Will Be ("Throw Me A Rope"),</em> a highlight of their live shows for the past several years.</p>

</div>
<p>UCSC has launched a new major in robotics engineering, an interdisciplinary field that combines electrical, computer, and mechanical engineering. The new major, leading to a B.S. degree, is the first of its kind in the UC system.</p>
<p>"Robots are used in many industry segments today, including automotive, aerospace, electronics and computers, industrial machinery, telecommunications, medicine, agriculture, mining, and textiles. As technology continues to bring cyber and physical worlds together, the demand for robotics engineers will continue to increase, which makes our new major a much-needed addition to the curriculum of the Baskin School of Engineering," said J. J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, Baskin Professor and chair of computer engineering in UCSC's Jack Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>The Department of Computer Engineering will administer the new program. Students started enrolling in the robotics engineering major this fall.</p>

</div>
<p>Just imagine the thrill of the senior social documentation ("soc doc") program students at UC Santa Cruz when the house lights went down at the Del Mar Theatre in Santa Cruz and their work appeared on the big screen.</p>
<p>These students had the chance to premiere their master's thesis video documentaries at the elegant and historic theater. It was the fifth annual Soc Doc Graduate Exhibition and the second to be showcased at the Del Mar. The screening had to be moved this year to the Del Mar's larger, downstairs screen after last year's full house resulted in many attendees being turned away.</p>
<p>"The work you will see, hear, and experience is the culmination of an intense two years as our students immersed themselves in documentary traditions and craft, scholarly research and analysis, and storytelling," said Renee Tajima-Pe&#241;a, professor and graduate director of the social documentation program.</p>

</div>
<p>With its redwood views and terraced gardens, UC Santa Cruz's McHenry Library is a gorgeous place to cram for exams. Now the library has expanded, while stepping up its role as a community hub.</p>
<p>Ten years in the making, the newly completed addition and renovation project allow the library to house a growing collection of print and electronic materials and offer more comprehensive electronic resources for students. The campus has chosen locally owned Hoffman's Bistro and Patisserie to operate the new Global Village Cafe in the lobby.</p>
<p>Nearby, on Science Hill, construction continues for UCSC's Biomedical Sciences Facility, set for completion early next year. The building will provide 92,000 square feet of laboratory space and facilities to support health and medical research. It will be used by students, faculty, and researchers in the Departments of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology; Chemistry and Biochemistry; Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology; and Biomolecular Engineering. A stem cell research center, funded by a $7.2 million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, will occupy the fourth floor.</p>

</div>
<p>"The UC Santa Cruz student may not get the first job compared to his or her Ivy League competitor ... but I assure you they will get the best job in the end... because they will out-think them."</p>
<p>Those rousing words were delivered by Kevin Beggs (Porter '89, politics and theater arts), president of Lionsgate Television Group, during his keynote address for a film symposium called <em>Bridging the Gap</em> at UCSC in June.</p>
<div class="callout-right"><img alt="George Blumenthal welcomes the audience and participants to Bridging the Gap." height="203" src="images/bridging-gap-grb.jpg" width="300"/> 
<p class="caption">George Blumenthal welcomes the audience and participants to Bridging the Gap.</p>

<p>Eminent social psychologist Elliot Aronson earned one of his highest accolades this year, honoring the work he has done in his post-academic career.</p>
<p>Aronson, UCSC emeritus professor of psychology, was named winner of the 2010 Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award.</p>
<p>The award recognizes outstanding University of California professors in the humanities or social sciences for research and activities since retirement. Established in 1983, it is named for Constantine Panunzio, a sociology professor at UCLA, who is known as the architect of the UC Retirement System. It includes a $5,000 prize.</p>
<p>Aronson, 79, who retired in 1994, is the fifth UCSC professor to win and the third in consecutive years. "For me, doing research on social psychological issues is not work&#8212;but a great joy," he said. "So, in a sense, I am being rewarded for having fun! Not bad."</p>

</div>
<p>This summer the campus received a gift of $500,000 to establish The George P. Hitchcock Modern Poetry Fund at Porter College.</p>
<p>A renowned publisher, poet, painter, and UCSC lecturer emeritus in creative writing, Hitchcock died in August 2010 at the age of 96.</p>
<p>His longtime partner, Marjorie Simon, has made the gift to honor and fulfill Hitchcock's wishes&#8212;to establish an endowment, through his estate, that would support poetry-related activities in perpetuity.</p>
<p>Hitchcock, who published the literary magazine <em>kayak,</em> taught writing at UC Santa Cruz from 1970 to 1989.</p>
<p>The endowment will provide support for projects including residencies for poets, readings, a poetry prize, and more.</p>

<h2>Video shows tool use by a fish</h2>
<div class="callout-right"><img alt="Tool-using fish" height="158" src="images/tool-using-fish.jpg" width="232"/> 
<p class="caption">Tool-using fish The first <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/09/fish-tool-use.html">video</a> of tool use by a fish has been published in the journal Coral Reefs by Giacomo Bernardi, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>
</div>
<p>"What the movie shows is very interesting," Bernardi said. "The animal excavates sand to get the shell out, then swims for a long time to find an appropriate area where it can crack the shell. It requires a lot of forward thinking, because there are a number of steps involved. For a fish, it's a pretty big deal."</p>
<p>The actions recorded in the video are remarkably similar to previous reports of tool use by fish.</p>
<p>Bernardi shot the video in Palau in 2009.</p>
<p>Tool use was once considered an exclusively human trait, and Jane Goodall's reports of tool use in chimpanzees in the 1960s came as a stunning revelation. Since then, many other animals have been observed using tools, including various primates, several kinds of birds, dolphins, elephants, and other animals.</p>

My name is Will Brotherson and I am the Program Director of the Student Volunteer Center. The Student Volunteer Center is a non-profit, student-run and student-funded organization whose mission is to provide meaningful volunteer opportunities to UCSC students. You may have seen some of our flyers posted around the campus, or came to check out our booth at the Fall OPERS Festival, and wondered &#8220;What exactly does SVC do?&#8221; Well in short, we help students get involved! <br/>
<br/>
Far too often, students who want to get involved in their community get discouraged when they realize how difficult getting the ball rolling can be. After all, there are only so many flyers one can scavenge through on a bus stop. And what if none of those opportunities are interesting to you? That&#8217;s where SVC comes in! We act as the bridge between interested students and community organizations. Essentially, we are UCSC&#8217;s one-stop shop for all things volunteer related! <br/>
<br/>
So if you&#8217;re interested in getting involved in the community, through volunteering or internships, we are the people you should see first! To get started, you can email us at <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:volunteer@ucsc.edu">volunteer@ucsc.edu</a> and browse through our website: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/svc/">http://www2.ucsc.edu/svc/</a>. Also, feel free to drop by our office anytime; we are located at Hahn Student Services, Room 245 at the Dean of Students Office.

<br/>
His talk, "The Psychology of Self-Persuasion: Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts," will begin at 7 p.m. the Music Recital Hall on the UCSC campus. It is free and open to the public. Parking is available for $3 per vehicle in the Performing Arts lot.<br/>
<br/>
Aronson taught at UCSC from 1974 to 1994&#160; and is one of the preeminent social psychologists of the 20th century. He has written or edited more than 20 books including <em>The Social Animal, The Jigsaw Classroom, Nobody Left to Hate, Mistakes Were Made, (but not by me): Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts</em>, and last year, a memoir <em>Not By Chance Alone: My Life as a Social Psychologist</em>.<br/>
<br/>
For more than a half century, Aronson designed and conducted experiments on social influence and persuasion.&#160; While social influence via direct persuasion (as in debate or advertising) can be quite effective, Aronson demonstrated that the most powerful form of persuasion is self-persuasion.<br/>
<br/>
Aronson will show how this phenomenon applies in a variety of areas including politics, medicine, the law, sexual behavior, and everyday decision-making.<br/>
<br/>
He is the only person in the 120-year history of the American Psychological Association receive all three of its highest awards--for distinguished writing, distinguished teaching, and distinguished research. In 1982, he was awarded the Gordon Allport Prize for his contribution to interracial harmony.&#160; In 1981, the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education named him Professor of the Year, and in 2007, he received the William James Award from the Association for Psychological Science for his "lifetime of significant intellectual contributions to the basic science of psychology."<br/>
<br/>
This year he was named winner of the Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award for 2010 that recognizes outstanding University of California professors in the humanities or social sciences for research and activities since retirement.<br/>
<br/>
Aronson received his B.A. from Brandeis University in 1954, his M.A. from Wesleyan University in 1956, and his Ph.D. in psychology from Stanford University in 1959. He began teaching at Harvard University in 1959 and moved in 1962 to the University of Minnesota. He joined the University of Texas in 1965 before joining UCSC nine years later. After retirement he continued to teach at UCSC and later Stanford University.<br/>

<p>Guthman challenges many widely held assumptions about the &#8220;obesity epidemic&#8221; in her new book, <em>Weighing In: Obesity, Food Justice, and the Limits of Capitalism</em> (University of California Press, 2011).&#160; "I have nothing against &#8220;good food&#8221; - I eat it myself," says Guthman, a self-confessed "foodie" whose father could be called a health-food nut in the 1950s and '60s, "but the approach is based on assumptions about obesity&#8217;s causes and consequences that don&#8217;t hold up to scrutiny."</p>
<p>While she acknowledges that Americans have gotten bigger over the past several decades Guthman is not convinced that obesity is the problem it's made out to be. "The way statistics are constructed and presented tend to overstate the problem," she says. For example, the body mass index (BMI), a ratio of height to weight, "doesn't take into account people with big bones or lots of muscle."<br/>
<br/>
And besides it's not necessarily the case that being bigger is unhealthy, she says, referencing studies that show people in the &#8220;normal&#8221; range of BMI do not live longer than those who are overweight or even slightly obese. "In general, we need to be more concerned with pathology and less with size."<br/>
<br/>
The widely accepted direct cause of obesity is a disrupted energy balance &#8211; too many calories taken in, not enough energy expended through exercise to burn them off. But it's more complicated than that, according to Guthman's analysis.<br/>
<br/>
First, socioeconomic status is strongly correlated to weight, Guthman writes. Many assume that the reason poor people are bigger is that they can only afford to buy cheap, fattening food. "But there&#8217;s more to the story," she says. "Studies have shown that fat people are subject to discrimination in education, job placement, wages, and health care. Thinness doesn&#8217;t guarantee high status, but obesity pretty much guarantees low status. So maybe low economic status is as much a consequence of obesity as a cause."<br/>
<br/>
Then,&#160; there are environmental factors. Guthman points to studies that suggest that toxins in our air, water and food contribute to the body storing fat. "Emerging research is showing environmental toxins may be playing a big role in obesity, in ways that have little to do with people&#8217;s daily habits. Many of these toxins are endocrine disrupting chemicals that can affect development before birth, for example by directing stem cells with no particular destination to become fat cells," she says.<br/>
<br/>
Guthman draws on both political-economic and cultural analysis to find out what's making us fat and whether it matters. She looks at the current culture of "healthism," the industrial food system, socioeconomic factors, and capitalism itself. Basically, she argues, we have a political economy of bulimia. We&#8217;re supposed to keep the economy afloat by consuming and not interfering with the business of the business, but we&#8217;re also supposed to exercise discipline and self-restraint in ways that are equally kind to capitalism.<br/>
<br/>
Guthman concludes that fixing the food system must go far beyond the question of &#8220;what to eat&#8221; and engage with policy. Not only food and farming policy, but immigration policy, trade policy, tax policy and environmental regulation. "All have had a role in making cheap, nutritionally vacuous food and making people dependent on it," she says.&#160; "Food needs to be regulated at the point of production, not consumption."&#160;<br/>
<br/>

Has cancer finally met its match?</article-subhead><article-text><p>&#8220;If we can put a man on the moon, why can&#8217;t we find a cure for cancer?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a familiar question that embodies a collective frustration Americans have over the lack of a cure for cancer. Few diseases touch as many lives, and no diagnosis is more dreaded.</p>
<p>This year alone, the American Cancer Society estimates that more than 1.6 million people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with cancer and roughly half a million will die from the disease.</p>
<p>Despite how these statistics are reported, scientists now realize that cancer is not one disease. There are types, like breast or prostate cancer, and there are subtypes of those. Tumor cells from people with the same subtype might have different genetic fingerprints. Likewise, a person&#8217;s tumor itself is made up of different cell types.</p>
<p>With so much variation, can we ever hope to win the war President Nixon declared on cancer more than 40 years ago?</p>
<p>If we continue to treat cancer simply based on its organ or tissue of origin, the answer is &#8220;probably not.&#8221; (Scientists are now learning that there is a subtype of breast cancer whose tumor cells more closely resemble those of a subtype of lung cancer.) If we can tailor treatments based on the genetic fingerprint of an individual&#8217;s particular type of cancer, then just maybe the answer will be &#8220;yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 (with help from UC Santa Cruz researchers) and faster, cheaper DNA sequencing technology, the goal of personalizing cancer diagnosis and treatment finally seems within reach.</p>
<h2 id="a_catalog_of_defects">A catalog of defects</h2>
<p>To make this dream a reality, scientists are creating The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a catalog of the genetic defects that lead to each particular type of cancer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cancer is a disease that is caused by mutations in cells that make them grow in an uncontrolled fashion,&#8221; said David Haussler, a UC Santa Cruz distinguished professor of biomolecular engineering and a member of TCGA Research Network&#8217;s central coordinating committee. &#8220;Because cancer is a genetic disease, it is fundamentally important to understand what those mutations are. We have not had the technology to do that on a large scale ever before.&#8221;</p>
<p>TCGA is a comprehensive, collaborative effort funded by the National Cancer Institute and the National Human Genome Research Institute, both part of the National Institutes of Health. It involves 150 researchers at more than two dozen institutions nationwide, including UCSC. They have begun with the 20 most common cancers and recently sequenced their 1,000th tumor genome.</p>
<p>Haussler and his colleagues are hoping that, like women who test positive for the HER2 gene amplification and are treated with the drug Herceptin, all cancer patients will one day receive treatments that target their particular cancer. They predict hat TCGA will transform the practice of cancer medicine and our understanding of the basics of cancer biology.</p>
<p>&#8220;TCGA is the largest cancer genomics project in the world. There is nothing like it,&#8221; said Christopher Benz, professor and program director, Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato.</p>
<p>Benz spent most of his career at UC San Francisco, where he set up its first laboratory dedicated to the study of human breast cancers, and where he continues to treat breast cancer patients. Now, along with Haussler, he is co-principal investigator of TCGA&#8217;s UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center, one of seven such centers in the network.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together, we have a unique synergy of expertise,&#8221; he said of his collaboration with UCSC partners. His job is to help identify genomic changes that are clinically relevant. &#8220;When we put our heads together, we can come to the right conclusions about what is making these cancers tick and how we might go about attacking them with our therapeutic arsenal.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="pioneering_bioinformatics">Pioneering bioinformatics</h2>
<p>While Benz brings a clinical perspective to the team, Haussler&#8217;s expertise is in the application of computer science and information technology to the field of biology and medicine&#8212;a field called bioinformatics. Haussler&#8217;s team built the computer methods to assemble the first working draft of the human genome. They also created the UCSC Genome Browser, an open-source, online tool used by geneticists, molecular biologists, and physicians as well as students and teachers of evolution for access to genomic information.</p>
<p>Today, Haussler and UCSC colleagues are pioneering new methods in bioinformatics for TCGA so that researchers can transfer, access, and store the 300 gigabytes of data that are generated for each tumor genome.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just moving these files from one institution to another overwhelms the standard Internet,&#8221; Haussler explained. &#8220;We are building the infrastructure that will allow personalized medicine in general, and cancer treatment in particular, to become a reality,&#8221; said Haussler, who is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.</p>
<p>UCSC&#8217;s TCGA team is also coming up with new ways of analyzing the data they and others are generating. &#8220;One of the big difficulties of translating cancer genomics to the clinic is that we can read mutations, but we can&#8217;t understand them,&#8221; Haussler said.</p>
<p>To that end, UCSC&#8217;s Josh Stuart spent a year writing code for software that searches tumor genomic data for only those combinations of mutations that are biologically relevant&#8212;that is, ones that might make a normal cell into a cancer cell.</p>
<p>&#8220;For years, biologists have been amassing knowledge of how genes act together in so-called genetic pathways. Recently, people have begun to make databases of this knowledge,&#8221; said Stuart, associate professor of biomolecular engineering. &#8220;Our contribution is that we came up with a computer program that uses data from a patient sample to figure out which genetic pathways are altered from their normal function.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="a_test_case">A test case</h2>
<p>Once they have identified the mutations that may be leading to a particular cancer, researchers then hope to identify existing drugs or develop new ones that interfere with the cellular or molecular changes brought about by the mutations.</p>
<p>Stuart, Haussler, Benz, and their TCGA collaborators put this new program to the test when they looked at data from 316 patients with ovarian cancer. Published in Nature in June, the TCGA study revealed that a particular pathway was characteristically disrupted in the tumors of ovarian cancer patients.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until we looked at the data in this way, no one had really appreciated the importance of that particular pathway,&#8221; Stuart explained. Further analysis supported the existence of four distinct subtypes of the disease and revealed 68 genes that could be targeted by existing Food and Drug Administration&#8211;approved or experimental therapeutic compounds&#8212;most already approved for the treatment of other diseases.</p>
<h2 id="back_to_basics">Back to basics</h2>
<p>This kind of genomic approach to cancer has not only resulted in surprising findings about individual cancers, but also promises to influence the direction of basic cancer research.</p>
<p>UCSC&#8217;s Jeremy Sanford is a molecular biologist who studies how gene regulators, called RNA binding proteins, work. Sanford was awarded a grant by the Santa Cruz Cancer Benefit Group to study the activity of an RNA binding protein that is associated with advanced pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to identify the RNA targets of the protein, understand what pathways are influenced by it, and look at how removing the protein affects the biology of the cancer cell,&#8221; said Sanford, an assistant professor of molecular, cell, and developmental (MCD) biology.</p>
<p>Sanford said his research is guided by the data being generated by Haussler and his colleagues. &#8220;They identify variation. That leads to testable hypotheses.&#8221; It&#8217;s up to scientists like himself, he said, totest those hypotheses.</p>
<p>And just as basic scientists look to TCGA for clues to how normal cells work, so does the future of personalized medicine depend on the progress of basic science, said Doug Kellogg, a professor of MCD biology.</p>
<p>Kellogg studies the molecular mechanisms that control cell division, mechanisms scientists do not fully understand yet. &#8220;We really need to identify the mechanisms that control cell division,&#8221; Kellogg said. &#8220;We need ways to attack tumors, and that requires more basic biology.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="revolutionizing_cancer_medicine">Revolutionizing cancer medicine</h2>
<p>In addition to more basic biology at the bench, the genomic era is also going to require changes at the bedside, Benz said.</p>
<p>These changes include&#8212;though may not be limited to&#8212;a new way of assigning patients to arms of clinical trials based on their cancer genomics and new ways to find patients for those trials that does not compromise privacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need the equivalent of a transplant registry for tumor samples. We have to get organized, and we have to break down barriers so that we can disseminate information freely around the country,&#8221; said Benz.</p>
<p>Testing treatments for different subtypes of cancer will also be a challenge, Haussler said. &#8220;The existing system for clinical trials only tests one thing at a time. The process is too cumbersome. TCGA proves that nearly every tumor has a different combination of mutations. There are far too many combinations to test them one at a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>TCGA represents nothing less than a revolution in medicine. &#8220;Big revolutions like this create stresses and strains,&#8221; Haussler said.</p>
<p>But the changes that are needed to make personalized cancer treatment the rule and not the exception will be worth it, Haussler predicted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can imagine a world where we can come up with a treatment for any combination of mutations in a person&#8217;s tumor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have to make that world a reality.&#8221;</p>

New Media (DANM) program will transform Santa Cruz&#8217;s Museum of Art &amp; History into a dynamic hub of new interactive digital art and technology.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Featuring live demonstrations throughout the evening by 20 DANM artists, the event will showcase a wide variety of research and innovative technological developments&#8212;ranging from mobile technology, interactive design, and animation, to performance, video mixing, audio installation, and web based applications.<br/>
<br/>
The projects include <strong>Data Surf</strong>&#8212;an interactive surfboard interface that rewards participants with their own mirrored image in a mix of colorful swirling visuals when they achieve balance and equilibrium on the surfboard.<br/>
<br/>
Another student will perform with his <strong>VJacket</strong>&#8212;a wearable jacket with built-in touch sensors that produce live video effects.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The Sad Song Project</strong> invites participants to share their sad songs through a video and social networking piece that seeks to help the community release its emotions through song.<br/>
<br/>
And artwork from the Museum of Art &amp; History&#8217;s collection will be reinterpreted through a <strong>Drawing Machine</strong> created by two alumni of the DANM program.<br/>
<br/>
The idea for the show evolved through discussions between Drew Detweiler&#8212;a recent UCSC graduate&#8212;and Nina Simon, the new Executive Director of the museum.<br/>
<br/>
Detweiler met Simon while exhibiting work with fellow DANM alum Lyes Belhocine at the Cruzio First Friday grand opening.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Sometimes we feel a bit isolated from the city up here on the hill, so this seemed like a great way to share our work with the larger Santa Cruz community,&#8221; said Detweiler.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I have always been delighted by the willingness of people in Santa Cruz to interact with digital art,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We learn so much by observing how people interact with our work, so this type of community engagement is essential for our development as artists."<br/>
<br/>
Detweiler noted that he and Belhocine have been exhibiting their work extensively throughout the Bay Area since they both graduated from UCSC in 2010.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;We have met other DANM alumni who are out there trying to get their work into local venues; I wanted to reach out to these alumni to get them together with current students to share our experiences.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;This will be the largest showing of DANM artists in one venue and represents artists from several different graduating classes,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I hope that this alumni/ student show will become an annual event.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
The UCSC show is part of the &#8220;3rd Friday at MAH&#8221; series. It takes place on Friday, October 21, from 5 to 9 p.m. Admission is $5 general, $3 for Students.<br/>
<br/>

Second, what are we getting for the additional cost? And third, how can we influence the future of the university? These questions are important, and I'd like to share my thoughts with the entire campus community.</p>
<p><br/>
The answers to the first two questions are related. Tuition is going up because the state has cut funding to campuses. Unfortunately, tuition hikes do not fully replace the reductions in state funding, so budget cuts have had to be taken across the campus. In other words, tuition hikes are partially offsetting the state funding reductions.<br/>
<br/>
To their credit, the students I've spoken with this quarter understand these tradeoffs&#8212;even those who are struggling to pay their own bills by working more and/or taking on additional debt.<br/>
<br/>
Students today are paying a greater portion of the cost of a UC education than ever before. This is why I feel so strongly about building new pathways to ensure that students are well-represented in decision making at UC Santa Cruz, and it's why I am creating two new structures to enhance student input.<br/>
<br/>
First, the Student Services Advisory Committee (SSAC) will provide input to my office on matters that impact the student experience. This committee will include seven students, including two representatives from the Student Union Assembly (SUA), one member from the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA), and one representative each from college government, a resource center, an alternative housing community, and the Student Fee Advisory Committee.<br/>
<br/>
Second, the Campus Provost's Student Leadership Consortium will bring together representatives of 28 student organizations and communities across campus to foster discussion and collaboration. With meetings once every Winter and Spring quarter, this group will include members of the African/Black Student Alliance, the Asian Pacific Student Alliance, the Campus Sustainability Council, the Disability Alliance, Educational Opportunity Programs/Students Informing Now, The Network, Rainbow Theater, the University Interfaith Council, student media and government organizations, veterans, and others.<br/>
<br/>
These new structures will increase the amount of student input I receive, building on my regularly scheduled meetings with leaders of student government, ad hoc meetings with student groups, and my new informal open office hours in Quarry Plaza, which debuted last week. As always, I am eager to hear from students, as well as faculty and staff. I can be reached at cpevc@ucsc.edu.<br/>
<br/>
I want students to have a strong voice&#8212;at UCSC and at a systemwide level. Many UCSC students are already involved in UC advocacy efforts in Sacramento, and I applaud them for their efforts. We are facing a multi-year challenge that compels us to work together on multiple fronts.</p>

Para:&#160; La Comunidad de UC Santa Cruz<br/>
<br/>
Desde: Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway<br/>
<br/>
Sobre:&#160; Lo que Escuchando de los Estudiantes este Trimestre<br/>
<br/>
En una serie de eventos este trimestre, desde el movimiento al campus de estudiantes, hasta&#160; los ayuntamientos estudiantiles, he o&#237;do tres preocupaciones de nuestros estudiantes: En primer lugar, &#191;por qu&#233; sigue subiendo el costo de matricula? En segundo lugar, &#191;qu&#233; estamos recibiendo por el costo adicional? Y en tercer lugar, &#191;c&#243;mo podemos influir el futuro de la universidad? Estas preguntas son importantes, y me gustar&#237;a compartir mis pensamientos con la comunidad del campus.</p>
<p>Las respuestas a las dos primeras preguntas est&#225;n relacionadas. La matr&#237;cula est&#225; subiendo debido a que el estado ha recortado la financiaci&#243;n al campus. Por desgracia, las alzas de matr&#237;cula no sustituyen completamente a la reducci&#243;n de los fondos estatales, asi que recortes de presupuesto han tenido que ser tomadas en todo el campus. En otras palabras, las alzas de matr&#237;cula son compensando parcialmente la reducci&#243;n de los fondos estatales.</p>
<p>A su favor, los estudiantes con que he hablado este trimestre entienden estas compensaciones--incluso aquellos que est&#225;n luchando para pagar sus propias facturas por trabajar m&#225;s y/o asumir deuda adicional.</p>
<p>Los estudiantes de hoy est&#225;n pagando una porci&#243;n mayor del costo de una educaci&#243;n en UC que nunca. Esto es porque me siento tan fuertemente sobre la construcci&#243;n de nuevas v&#237;as para asegurar que estudiantes est&#225;n bien representados en la toma de decisiones en UC Santa Cruz, y es por eso que estoy creando dos nuevas estructuras para mejorar la participaci&#243;n de los estudiantes.<br/>
<br/>
En primer lugar, el Comit&#233; Consultor de Servicios para Estudiantes (SSAC) aportar&#225; su contribuci&#243;n a mi oficina sobre asuntos que afectan a la experiencia de los estudiantes.&#160; Este comit&#233; incluira siete estudiantes, dos representantes de la Asamblea de la Uni&#243;n de Estudiantes (SUA), un miembro de la Asamblea de Estudiantes de Posgrado (GSA), y un representativo de cada gobierno colegial, un centro de recurso, una comunidad de viviendas alternativas, y el Comit&#233; Consultor de Cuotas de Estudiantes.<br/>
<br/>
En segundo lugar, el Consorcio del Liderazgo de Estudiantes reunir&#225; a representantes de 28 organizaciones de estudiantes y comunidades en todo el campus para fomentar la discusi&#243;n y la colaboraci&#243;n. Con reuniones una vez cada trimester del invierno y primavera, este grupo incluye miembros de la Alianza de Estudiantes Africanos/Negros, la Alianza, la Alianza de Estudiantes de Asia del Pac&#237;fico, el Consejo de Sostenibilidad del Campus, la Alianza de la Discapacidad, Programas para la Oportunidad Educativa/ Estudiantes Informando Ahora, La Red, Teatro del Arco Iris, el Consejo Interreligioso de la Universidad, los medios de comunicaci&#243;n de estudiantes y organizaciones no gubernamentales, los veteranos, y otros.<br/>
<br/>
Estas nuevas estructuras se incrementar&#225;n la cantidad de entradas de estudiantes que recibo, bas&#225;ndose en mis reuniones regulares con los l&#237;deres de gobierno estudiantil, reuniones ad hoc con grupos de estudiantes y mis nuevas horas de oficina en la Plaza Quarry, que se estren&#243; la semana pasada. Como siempre, estoy ansioso de escuchar a los estudiantes, as&#237; como profesores y personal. Puedo ser alcanzado en cpevc@ucsc.edu.<br/>
<br/>
Quiero que los estudiantes tengan una voz fuerte--en UCSC y a un nivel de todo el sistema. Muchos de los estudiantes de UCSC ya est&#225;n involucrados en los esfuerzos de promoci&#243;n de la UC en Sacramento, y yo los aplaudo por sus esfuerzos.

<p>&#8220;Using the very simple skills of looking at a patient&#8212;noticing he is overweight and carrying a pack of cigarettes in his pocket&#8212;tells me so much more about his phenotype, and therefore his future, than I can now tell from his genome,&#8221; says Verghese, a Stanford University professor of medicine and <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Cutting for Stone.</em></p>
<p>Verghese does not deny the power and utility of the tools of modern medicine. He marvels at how many cancer treatments can now be tailored to a person&#8217;s particular tumor type. Verghese does, however, caution physicians against focusing too much on the data generated by today&#8217;s tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a danger that the patient becomes the &#8216;iPatient&#8217;&#8212;a term I coined to represent the virtual construct of the patient in the computer.&#8221;</p>
<p>On October 11, Verghese gave a talk entitled &#8220;The Art of Medicine in the Era of Homo Technologicus&#8221; as part of the Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture series in conjunction with this year&#8217;s UCSC Founders Celebration events. He advocated for a new humanism in today&#8217;s health care system that, all too often, focuses on a person&#8217;s disease rather than on the person.</p>
<p>Verghese suspects we have come to this crossroads as doctors and patients because of health care reimbursement, which is skewed toward procedures and diagnostic tests.</p>
<p>The solution, Verghese says, lies in changing an entrenched system of incentives. &#8220;Hospitals make more money in the emergency room when more tests are ordered. Doctors make more money for doing things to patients than they make from listening to the patient, examining the patient, and being thoughtful. If those incentives were reversed, we would solve a lot of problems.&#8221;</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Award-winning writer and producer Marti Noxon (<strong>Mad Men, Grey&#8217;s Anatomy, Glee</strong>) was presented with the first UCSC Film &amp; Digital Media Prestigious Alumni Award at a ceremony held last week at the Soho House in West Hollywood.<br/>
<br/>
Nearly 100 UCSC alumni currently working in the arts and entertainment industry attended the event, hosted by Arts Division Dean David Yager.<br/>
<br/>
The participants included several members of the dean&#8217;s leadership board, including executive producer Brannon Braga (<strong>Terra Nova, 24, Star Trek</strong>), director Sheldon Epps (<strong>George Lopez, Frasier, Friends</strong>), producer Ron Yerxa (<strong>Little Children, Little Miss Sunshine</strong>), Rhino Films CEO Steve Nemeth, executive producer Brian Kavanaugh-Jones (<strong>Take Shelter, Insidious</strong>), and Kikim Media CEO Kiki Kapany.<br/>
<br/>
Noxon, a 1987 graduate of UC Santa Cruz with a degree in theater arts, noted the warm and intimate atmosphere that permeated the alumni event.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I was able to connect with old friends and was reminded of how unique UC Santa Cruz is and was,&#8221; said Noxon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came away with a renewed sense of it's importance in my 'origin story' and a renewed desire to support both the Alumni and the Arts Division.&#8221; &#160;<br/>
<br/>
Braga, co-executive producer of the new TV series <strong>Terra Nova</strong> along with Steven Spielberg, noted&#160;that the event was held at The Soho House &#8220;with panoramic views of Los Angeles, great food, good wine, and faces I hadn't seen in 20 years.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I made some connections and new friends with those whom I already share UCSC alumni history. It was not only a memorable alumni event, it was a great party," Braga added.<br/>
<br/>
The Los Angeles gathering was a Southern California follow-up to the UCSC Arts Division&#8217;s&#160;<strong>Bridging the Gap</strong> film and television symposium held on campus last June.</p>
<p>The goal of both events was to bring together and celebrate the work of UCSC alumni in the entertainment industry.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It was remarkable to me that so many alumni were re-engaging and seeing people they haven&#8217;t seen in 20 years,&#8221; noted Dean Yager.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;And that they were hearing from other alumni in the industry about how being a Banana Slug really gives you great opportunities to be successful in the film and television industry,&#8221; he added.<br/>
<br/>
Addressing the crowd, Yager announced the launching of a new <a href="http://artsalums.ucsc.edu">Arts Alumni web site</a> to help make it easier for UCSC alums to network.<br/>
<br/>
The Dean also encouraged the group to think about supporting vital new initiatives for the UCSC Arts Division that he characterized as "game changers," including a named School of the Arts, the University Museum of the Arts and Sciences, and a new film building.<br/>
<br/>
The event included a tasting of vintage and unusual wines by renowned Santa Cruz winemaker Randall Grahm. Founder of Bonny Doon Vineyard, Grahm is a close friend and supporter of the arts at UC Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
A number of UCSC Film &amp; Digital Media faculty attended, including department chair Larry Andrews, along with Shelley Stamp, L.S. Kim, Gustavo Vazquez, and Renee Tajima-Pe&#241;a.<br/>

<p>That&#8217;s the time-tested credo of Kevin Beggs (Porter &#8216;89, politics/theater arts), president of Lionsgate Television Group, one of the most powerful independent producers of TV programming.</p>
<p>Others might hesitate to produce a comedy series about a pot-dealing soccer mom in an upper-middle-class suburb (<em>Weeds</em>), a period drama about promiscuous ad executives working on Madison Avenue at the height of the Cold War (<em>Mad Men</em>), or a dark comedy about an ER nurse navigating the crumbling health care system while hiding an addiction to pain pills and carrying on an illicit affair with the hospital pharmacist (<em>Nurse Jackie</em>).</p>
<p>Others, for that matter, might run screaming from a new show starring Charlie Sheen, freshly fired from <em>Two and a Half Men</em> this spring by Warner Brothers amid allegations of Sheen&#8217;s substance abuse, and after a spectacular fracas between Sheen and the show&#8217;s co-creator, Chuck Lorre.</p>
<p>But Lionsgate Television&#8212;which produces <em>Mad Men</em> for AMC and <em>Weeds</em> and <em>Nurse Jackie</em> for Showtime, and is currently developing a new series called <em>Anger Management</em> with Sheen as the star&#8212;seems to thrive in dangerous places.</p>
<p>Beggs is part of a growing coterie of successful Hollywood Banana Slugs including Rick Carter, production designer (<em>Avatar, Jurassic Park</em>), and Ron Yerxa, producer, Bona Fide Productions (<em>Little Miss Sunshine</em>). In June, he served as the keynote speaker at a UCSC symposium, Bridging the Gap, designed to foster strong connections between the campus and its many successful entertainment industry alumni, especially in the film and television industries.</p>
<p>Beggs recently spoke about his life on the edge, and what it&#8217;s like to follow his gut instincts in a hyper-competitive market.</p>
<p>&#8220;I still feel, as a smaller company, we have to be bigger risk-takers creatively. We have to call bigger and longer shots,&#8221; said Beggs, 45, who is responsible for developing and producing original series, movies for TV, limited series, and reality shows for Lionsgate Television. &#8220;We have had great success with projects that other people would not do. I would not want to be known as the company that passed on something like <em>Mad Men</em> and <em>Weeds</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rejection is part of the creation mythology of <em>Mad Men.</em> Showtime and HBO both passed on the series before the AMC network and Lionsgate took it on. <em>Mad Men</em> is now a cultural phenomenon, but runaway success can lead to unexpected challenges. &#8220;Often, managing a successful show is more difficult than handling a less successful show,&#8221; Beggs said.</p>
<p>Beggs was referring to the recent negotiations between <em>Mad Men</em> creator and executive producer Matthew Weiner, Lionsgate, and AMC, the network that broadcasts the show.</p>
<p>AMC only had an option for the first five seasons of <em>Mad Men</em> and had to renegotiate a deal with Lionsgate. On top of this, AMC executives had no deal in place with Weiner; they returned to the negotiating table to bring him on board for the next three seasons.</p>
<p>The issues were resolved this summer. On the down side, <em>Mad Men</em> fanatics must wait until 2012 to see the new episodes.</p>
<p>Beggs said he is &#8220;relieved, absolutely&#8221; that the situation has been resolved. Such disagreements are nothing new in the industry, he said. &#8220;This one was maybe a bit more high profile because of <em>Mad Men&#8217;</em>s zealous fan base.&#8221; He thanked fans of the series for &#8220;passion and patience.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="getting_down_in_the_weeds">Getting down in the weeds</h2>
<p>Beggs prides himself in running a streamlined operation with a &#8220;less-is more&#8221; approach. While he sometimes finds himself producing shows for larger networks &#8220;to pay the bills,&#8221; those more conventional moneymaking choices embolden the company to take chances and &#8220;develop the kinds of series we would like to watch, personally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Citing one edgy example, Lionsgate began producing <em>Weeds,</em> starring Mary-Louise Parker, almost nine years ago. The suburban upper-middle-class potdealer concept hit Beggs on a gut level.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe, personally, having gone to school in Santa Cruz and spent much of my childhood in Marin County, the series resonated because of the irony, the certain kind of hypocritical moral stances that a lot of people take in life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, producing any comedy series is a calculated risk because Lionsgate generates much of its income overseas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most comedies don&#8217;t travel well,&#8221; Beggs said. He cited a few exceptions. &#8220;<em>Two and a Half Men</em> is very popular overseas. <em>The Simpsons</em> does great&#8212;since it&#8217;s animated, they can change all the voices. But in general it&#8217;s a risky perspective. <em>Weeds</em> proved a worthwhile risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>To date, Weeds has garnered an armful of Emmy awards and drawn upward of 3 million viewers.</p>
<h2 id="programming_on_the_edge">Programming on the edge</h2>
<p>So far, Lionsgate&#8217;s willingness to take on this kind of risky and expectation-defying scripted programming has paid off.</p>
<p>All television, including cable TV shows, could be much edgier, said L. S. Kim, a critical observer of popular media and an associate professor of film and digital media at UCSC.</p>
<p>Kim thinks audiences can be more accepting than TV executives may believe. &#8220;Executives/producers sometimes underestimate audiences&#8217; ability to come to terms with unfamiliar or unexpected characters or themes; when they do, by being presented with challenging material, this is social change.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she said that the relatively edgy content on several scripted cable shows&#8212;including a number of offerings produced by Lionsgate&#8212;successfully gives viewers pleasure while pulling them through a discomfort zone, a process that can make viewers stronger fans while creating a &#8220;dynamic relationship&#8221; between shows and audiences.</p>
<p>That &#8220;gray area&#8221;&#8212;the risky territory that lies somewhere between entertainment and discomfort&#8212;is a place where most networks and TV won&#8217;t go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lionsgate steps into that area, and crosses that border a little bit,&#8221; Kim said. &#8220;Cable and premium-cable networks have relatively more ability to push the envelope to present material that may be less comfortable or less familiar. For example, <em>Nurse Jackie</em> is not quite a sitcom. When you think of female nurses, you literally expect comfort. The show is about defying expectations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The making of film and TV programs remains a mystery to most viewers. &#8220;In fact, it involves a series of decisions,&#8221; said Kim. &#8220;Someone like Kevin Beggs, who was influenced by his education at UC Santa Cruz, makes decisions to try something a little different, right? &#8216;The Banana Slug way&#8217; is a slightly different way. It&#8217;s something I try to encourage my students to have the courage to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, one of Kim&#8217;s students had a chance to look at this decision-making process firsthand when she was a Lionsgate intern this summer in Santa Monica.</p>
<h2 id="the_sheen_factor">The Sheen factor</h2>
<p>Asked to comment on Sheen and <em>Anger Management,</em> Beggs compared it to some of the risky content produced by Lionsgate&#8217;s movie division, Lionsgate Films.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Disney would not release <em>Fahrenheit 911,</em> Lionsgate did, and had the highest-grossing box office in history [for a documentary],&#8221; Beggs said, referring to Michael Moore&#8217;s 2004 documentary about the Bush administration&#8217;s handling of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, Lionsgate Television won&#8217;t shy away from the &#8220;tricky and touchy.&#8230; A high-profile figure like Charlie Sheen kind of falls under the same category,&#8221; Beggs said.</p>
<p>Besides, Beggs insisted that doing a show with Sheen was &#8220;not much of a risk, really.&#8230;For all the public scrutiny of his life, and his larger-than-life persona, he has been anchoring, for eight seasons, the most successful show on television. No one disputes what a great actor he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that Lionsgate had been &#8220;in talks with Charlie&#8221; even before the <em>Anger Management</em> concept, spun off from a 2003 movie starring Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson, came up.</p>
<p>Besides, said Beggs, Lionsgate was drawn to the idea of a show based on a movie about a man who works to help other people deal with anger issues, but is not entirely in control of his own anger&#8212;and then, on top of all that, you get Charlie Sheen playing the role of the unstable protagonist.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you put all the elements together&#8230; it&#8217;s kind of a no-brainer.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="starting_out_in_a_tough_business">Starting out in a tough business</h2>
<p>Looking back on his trajectory, Beggs has plenty of advice for newly minted graduates who are just starting out in the entertainment world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Number one: You have to come to Los Angeles,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And number two, you have to pound the pavement&#8212;pound it aggressively, virtually and physically. You almost have to come to a place that is borderline stalker-like to get anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>He urges new graduates to take first jobs seriously, and not deprive themselves of that first opportunity just because an initial job &#8220;does not represent your ultimate career goal. It is almost impossible that the first job you ever get will be assistant to Steven Spielberg. It could happen, but it&#8217;s rare.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beggs learned all these lessons by pounding the pavement himself.</p>
<p>After graduating with honors from UCSC, he found work as a public schoolteacher, and then as the assistant to an accountant working on a reality show about the FBI&#8212;a far cry from the creative work he longed to be doing. Still,he won&#8217;t knock it. He helped the show save money by going with the U.S. Postal Service instead of relying exclusively on FedEx.</p>
<p>On top of that, this position led, within a couple of months, to getting on a set as a production assistant, which ultimately helped him land his first TV production job.</p>
<p>Networking and persistence paid off for Beggs, who first made a name for himself as a producer for the syndicated, highly successful <em>Baywatch</em> program starring David Hasselhoff.</p>
<p>When he was hired on at Lionsgate 13 years ago, it was primarily a film company with a smattering of TV assets. His job was to launch new series, taking a less-is-more approach. &#8220;We weren&#8217;t big or well-capitalized enough to work with big, big broadcast networks but we could work in cable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gradually, the company grew along with the cable industry itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our capital structure allowed us to be good partners. We crept into larger shows as we got a little bit bigger. Then the company started making some key acquisitions, and all of a sudden we had a home-entertainment infrastructure. Shows were getting sold as DVDs&#8212;a new idea at the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>One early success was a show Lionsgate Television, in conjunction with CBS Paramount Television, produced for UPN called <em>The Dead Zone,</em> based on the Stephen King horror novel. It wasone of the most successful premieres in cable TV history.</p>
<p>He believes Lionsgate benefitted from the spectacular growth of scripted cable programming.</p>
<p>&#8220;More and more cable networks started jumping into original programming because we&#8217;d already been in that space,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2 id="slugs_in_hollywood">Slugs in Hollywood</h2>
<p>While making his way in the entertainment world, Beggs has strengthened his connections to his alma mater. This year, Arts Division Dean David Yager reached out to Beggs to be part of a far-ranging arts advisory board. Though Beggs had never been back to UCSC since graduating, he eagerly signed on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kevin is incredibly happy and enthusiastic to give his time and energy,&#8221; Yager said. Now Beggs hopes to be part of an effort to make UCSC loom larger in the entertainment business, growing its profile, and its presence in those industries, the way Emerson College, New York University, and Columbia University have done.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have giant presences in our business, and they are fostered, in some ways, by the universities themselves,&#8221; Beggs said.</p>
<p>Beggs has more than just an affection for UCSC. He often references his college learning in his daily work. He finds himself drawing from both his majors &#8220;in a creative field where I shape a lot of creative visions,&#8221; and &#8220;when I&#8217;m simply lobbying for things.</p>
<p>&#8220;The term critical thinking&#8217; is thrown around loosely, but UCSC really pushes that,&#8221; he said. While theater arts was a &#8220;creative immersion,&#8221; his politics classes &#8220;really threw out every assumption you ever had about any kind of topic. There was an almost aggressive kind of debunking. You don&#8217;t just turn that off when you leave college.&#8221;</p>

Photo by Joseph Hoyt.</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Robins play a key role in transmission of West Nile virus across much of North America</article-subhead><article-text><p>After its initial appearance in New York in 1999, West Nile virus spread across the United States in just a few years and is now well established throughout North and South America. Both the mosquitoes that transmit it and the birds that are important hosts for the virus are abundant in areas that have been modified by human activities. As a result, transmission of West Nile virus is highest in urbanized and agricultural habitats.</p>
<p>"The virus has had an important impact on human health in the United States partly because it took advantage of species that do well around people," said Marm Kilpatrick, a biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who studies the ecology of infectious diseases.</p>
<p>West Nile virus can infect a wide range of animals, including more than 300 species of birds and 60 species of mosquitoes. It also infects mammals, reptiles, and even amphibians. But researchers have found that in most places only a few key species of bird "hosts" and mosquito "vectors" are important in transmission of the virus.</p>
<p>"We now know that in any given location, only one or two species of mosquitoes play a big role, and only a handful of birds appear to be important in overall transmission rates," said Kilpatrick, who reviewed a decade of research on the ecology and evolution of West Nile virus in a paper published in the October 21 issue of <em>Science</em>.</p>
<p>According to Kilpatrick, the familiar American robin plays a key role in the transmission of West Nile virus across much of North America. It is such an important host species that Kilpatrick calls robins "super-spreaders" of West Nile virus. The reason is not so much the abundance of robins, but rather the feeding patterns of the mosquitoes that transmit the virus. The mosquito species important in transmission seem to prefer robins over other, more abundant species of birds such as house sparrows.</p>
<p>"Robins are more important in transmission than their abundance alone would suggest," Kilpatrick said. "The peculiar feeding habits of the vectors play a really important role in transmission, and this idea applies to many different diseases. It's one of the really interesting things we've learned from the past decade of research on West Nile virus."</p>
<p>Insights gained from research on West Nile virus could help public health officials deal with other introduced diseases in the future. "The spread of disease-causing organisms is likely to only increase in the coming years," said Sam Scheiner, director of the Evolution and Ecology of Infectious Diseases program at the National Science Foundation (NSF). "West Nile virus has provided a test of our ability to respond to such spread. This research shows that predicting disease incidence in humans and other animals is more complex than first imagined, but that greater understanding of such complexities is possible--knowledge that can be applied to the next threat."</p>
<p>The globalization of trade and travel has spread many invasive species, including infectious pathogens like West Nile virus. Although its exact route of entry to New York is unknown, West Nile virus may have arrived in an infected mosquito carried across the Atlantic by an airplane, Kilpatrick said. The virus then adapted quickly to its new environment, evolving a new strain that was transmitted more efficiently by local mosquitoes than the introduced strain. By 2005, the new strain had completely displaced the introduced one throughout North America.</p>
<p>Three species of mosquitoes are key vectors for transmitting West Nile virus in much of North America. Interestingly, these mosquitoes are not among the species that feed frequently on people. They are bird specialists that happen to bite people often enough to cause human infections. "The mosquitoes that bite humans most are actually not as important in transmission of West Nile virus to humans because they rarely bite birds and thus rarely get infected in the first place," Kilpatrick said. "Instead, it's the species that feed mostly on birds and frequently get infected, but occasionally feed on people, that are most important."</p>
<p>Millions of birds have died from West Nile virus infection, with dramatic effects on the populations of some species. Crows, for example, are much less abundant than they were before the virus arrived. The robin population, which had been growing rapidly, has leveled off.</p>
<p>"Robins were on a steady upward trajectory thought to be linked to human land use--they love lawns and agricultural fields," Kilpatrick said. "Crow populations were growing even faster. Now crow populations have crashed downward and robins have leveled off, and we suspect that's due to West Nile virus."</p>
<p>The worst human outbreaks of West Nile virus in the United States occurred in 2002 and 2003. According to Kilpatrick, it's not clear whether the reduction in human disease since then represents a long-term trend or short-term variability. "It may be that with climatic conditions favorable for the virus we could again get very intense years of transmission," he said. "We don't know yet how much of the year-to-year variation can be explained by climatic conditions or other factors, such as acquired immunity in birds or humans."</p>
<p>Many other diseases caused by mosquito-borne or tick-borne viruses could potentially be introduced to the United States from overseas, Kilpatrick said. Understanding the ecology of these viruses may lead to strategies that could prevent a newly introduced pathogen from establishing itself as successfully as West Nile virus has.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick's research on West Nile virus is supported by grants from NSF and the National Institutes of Health.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1e98ea49807270460086a276e6a841cc"><name>review-fall-2011-teaching-teachers</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Teaching the teachers</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz serves California through Cal Teach, a program that encourages and prepares math and science students to become teachers. </summary><start-date>1319011200000</start-date><display-name>Teaching the teachers</display-name><path>/2011/10/review-fall-2011-teaching-teachers</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/10/review-fall-2011-teaching-teachers</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1319068297710</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1321405712823</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Matt King</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/10/images/villaron-monica.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/10/images/villaron-monica.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>villaron-monica.jpg</name><display-name>villaron-monica.jpg</display-name><file-size>100342</file-size><width>300</width><height>394</height></image><image-alt>Monica Villarón</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Monica Villar&#243;n, 2011 Cal Teach graduate<br/></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/10/images/villaron-students.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/10/images/villaron-students.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>villaron-students.jpg</name><display-name>villaron-students.jpg</display-name><file-size>94750</file-size><width>300</width><height>259</height></image><image-alt>Villarón with students at Ceiba College Prep</image-alt><image-caption>Villar&#243;n with students at Ceiba College Prep</image-caption></secondary-images><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/10/images/ceiba-students.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/10/images/ceiba-students.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ceiba-students.jpg</name><display-name>ceiba-students.jpg</display-name><file-size>117843</file-size><width>300</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Students participate in an exercise in Villarón’s geometry class, where they were studying</image-alt><image-caption>Students participate in an exercise in Villar&#243;n&#8217;s geometry class, where they were studying a logic section.

It was her first day as a high school math teacher, the first day she stood on her own in front of eager, indifferent, bored, or hyperactive students expecting her to have all the answers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was excited and nervous,&#8221; she said the day after she started teaching at Ceiba College Preparatory Academy in Watsonville. &#8220;I tried to form a relationship with the kids, but also set my rules for the rest of the year. By the end of the day, I was exhausted.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no escaping all the jitters and mistakes of a teacher&#8217;s rookie year, but Villar&#243;n has an edge over most first-year educators: the experience she gained in the Cal Teach program at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cal Teach gave me my first experience working with kids, so I feel I was able to learn how to connect with kids and became efficient at explaining things,&#8221; the 2011 graduate said, also noting the importance of traditional student teaching. &#8220;This will be my first year, but I feel prepared.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="turning_students_into_teachers">Turning students into teachers</h2>
<p>Preparing talented math and science students to become secondary-level teachers is the mission of Cal Teach, a statewide initiative launched in 2005 in response to a chronic shortage of highly qualified teachers in subjects so critical to economic competitiveness and to understanding and resolving complex modern problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Often science and math majors who are the most knowledgeable and excited about the subjects are not going into teaching,&#8221; said Kim Newman, coordinator of the P20 Partnerships Teaching Leadership initiative in the UC Office of the President. (P20 refers to the path from preschool to grad school.) &#8220;Being taught by non-math and science majors is reflected in the test scores of students and the number of young kids who are actually interested in math and science.&#8221;</p>
<p>While there are many factors that play into low test scores, the results locally and statewide are disheartening. In Santa Cruz County, only 20 percent of 9th grade students passed the basic math exam while 49 percent of 10th graders passed the science test, according to the 2011 STAR test results. Statewide, those numbers are 18 percent and50 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Typically, prospective teachers complete an undergraduate degree and then pursue the credential required to teach in California classrooms before getting their first taste of commanding a classroom.</p>
<p>High school graduates who know they want to teach usually attend one of the California State University campuses, but the UC system has the most science and math undergraduates in California, making it a fruitful hunting ground for future science and math teachers who may think they&#8217;re headed for a lab instead of a classroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re open to anyone who&#8217;s willing to explore the possibility of being a teacher,&#8221; said Gretchen Andreasen, a director of Cal Teach at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Our undergraduate program doesn&#8217;t replace what students do in a teaching credential program, but it gives them a clear sense of whether they may like teaching.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cal Teach at UC Santa Cruz is a freestanding program working in collaboration with several established departments (education, math, physics, biology, and Earth and planetary sciences) and schools throughout Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>That makes it risk-free for undergrads, who can test out the idea of being a teacher without straying off the pathway of their major. It also makes it effective because students are immediately in classrooms with real kids, learning about classroom management, lesson plans, and meeting the needs of diverse students.</p>
<h2 id="cal_teachers_in_classrooms">Cal Teachers in classrooms</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s far too soon to truly measure the impact of the program, but five years after Cal Teach launched, its first graduates are teaching and inspiring students up and down the state, including more than 15 in classrooms in Santa Cruz, Monterey, and San Benito counties.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re really starting to make a difference as strong candidates for our school districts,&#8221; Andreasen said. &#8220;One of the things that makes me proud and happy is how delighted Santa Cruz City Schools is with our students whom they&#8217;ve hired in the past couple years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cal Teach graduates show up the first day with &#8220;great depth of learning,&#8221; said Karen Hendricks, the assistant superintendent for human resources for the Santa Cruz district.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are prepared to engage students in rigorous and relevant curriculum and be very valuable members of our collaborative learning community,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The best package is one who has strong content knowledge and knows how to interact with students, parents, and colleagues. Students coming out of Cal Teach are very adept at those things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cal Teach students start with classes in pedagogy, some of which are taught by secondary teachers, and a series of progressively intensive internships, starting with 25 hours in the classroom of a host teacher.</p>
<p>In five years, nearly 2,000 students statewide and 349 students at UC Santa Cruz have enrolled in at least one Cal Teach internship. Of those Santa Cruz students, 224 have graduated, and Cal Teach staff believe 73 have gone on to pursue a teaching credential.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s 73 new math and science teachers who otherwise might be doing something else, who might never have heard the call, for example, to serve English languagelearners in South Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>Villar&#243;n grew up in Watsonville. She considered other career paths in college but in Cal Teach discovered education is her passion, through activities like teaching a calculus lesson in Spanish. She even turned down a research fellowship in order to take the teaching job at Ceiba.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very humbling to realize the struggle English-language learners face in our classrooms,&#8221; she said. &#8220;At the end of the day I knew that my calling was to help underrepresented minorities join the math, science, and engineering fields, and teaching was the perfect avenue to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watsonville High math teacher Vivian Moutafian taught Villar&#243;n in high school and in Cal Teach and calls her a &#8220;star student.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Monica is born to teach,&#8221; she said. &#8220;She&#8217;s hardworking and articulate, and she really cares about the students. She&#8217;s got everything it takes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moutafian should know. She&#8217;s been teaching for more than 30 years and has seen hundreds of young teachers.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a huge turnover in new teachers,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They often experience burnout. Cal Teach gives prospective teachers an opportunity to see firsthand what it means to teach and the support of their host teachers and Cal Teach instructors. I think we&#8217;ll keep more high-quality teachers this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>That may have been a great hook for a lesson by a new math teacher, but it&#8217;s a worrisome sign the economy is a long way from a vigorous recovery, and a slumping stock market only aggravates an already difficult fundraising environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The state budget crisis means inconsistent support from the state,&#8221; said Gretchen Andreasen, a director of Cal Teach at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Our current challenge is to find local donors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two retired math faculty from UC Santa Cruz are trying to fill the void, establishing the Edward and Miriam Landesman Fund for Future Teachers of Math or Science earlier this year.</p>
<p>Edward Landesman, professor emeritus, and his wife Miriam, a former lecturer, have been strong supporters of Cal Teach from the start. Edward was the first director of the Aurora Project, the community college component of Cal Teach.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we are to succeed in research and in industry and not lose our position as far as creativity and doing major work, we need to reach students early in their careers and motivate them to be teachers of math or science,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to the state, it&#8217;s important to the country, and it&#8217;s a profession from which participants can gain great satisfaction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of that motivation is financial. Becoming a teacher means a lot of extra expenses, everything from incidentals like the price of gas to get to a classroom internship and fees for state exams, to the significant costs of a credential program that adds a fifth year of schooling.</p>
<p>To encourage students to take on the challenge of teaching, the UC system has been raising money for stipends and internship expenses, and UC Santa Cruz has mobilized additional funds for scholarships for a credential program, thanks in large part to major campus donor and alumnus <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/04/review-spring-2011-philanthropy-bruce.html">Stephen Bruce</a> (Cowell &#8216;79, economics).</p>
<p>Systemwide cuts torpedoed some stipends last year, however, and enrollment in Cal Teach dropped. Through the Landesman Fund, the program is now raising about $50,000 to restore them in 2011&#8211;12, a modest figure that would provide critical aid to students already taking on debt to pursue a profession that is not especially remunerative.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our idea is to begin funding with a reasonable amount and others will contribute as well,&#8221; Landesman said. &#8220;We&#8217;re hoping by associating our names with Cal Teach, alumni will see the importance of this and want to contribute too.&#8221;</p>
<p>This funding is essential just as the program is maturing and producing teachers&#8212;its absence would have deleterious effects in a political environment where teachers are blamed for many of society&#8217;s ills, Andreasen said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can be very discouraging to go into teaching in this era. There&#8217;s a lot of bad news all the time about budgets, about how schools are not doing their job, suggesting teachers are not doing their jobs,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The students I work with are committed to making a better world by helping children learn. For them, the emotional impact is big when their choice of career is validated with financial support from Cal Teach, especially from individual donors like Stephen Bruce and the Landesmans.&#8221;</p>

As a major sponsor of the event, UC Santa Cruz will be hosting a reception at the Tech Museum on October 26 and a field trip on October 27, bringing a group of conference attendees to campus for faculty presentations and a tour of research labs.</p>
<p>SACNAS (the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing Hispanics/Chicanos and Native Americans in the "STEM" fields: science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Frank Talamantes, Clifton Poodry, and other UCSC faculty helped found SACNAS in the early 1970s, and the organization still has its headquarters in Santa Cruz. As in past years, a sizable contingent of undergraduates and graduate students from UC Santa Cruz will attend the 2011 national conference to present their research in the scientific sessions.</p>
<p>"We have always sent a lot of students to SACNAS conferences. It is a sign of the campus's longstanding commitment to supporting underrepresented students in the STEM fields," said Tyrus Miller, vice provost and dean of graduate studies at UCSC.</p>
<p>The SACNAS conference provides a valuable opportunity for students to give research presentations and receive feedback and guidance from volunteer mentors and judges who are all doctoral-level professional scientists. Sponsoring institutions play a critical role by providing faculty and researchers to serve as mentors and judges. The conference also offers networking opportunities, faculty presentations, and professional development workshops.</p>
<p>"It's a good place for students who are interested in graduate school to talk to faculty and learn about graduate programs. It gives them a step up in applying to graduate schools," said Malika Bell, director of STEM Diversity Programs at UCSC.</p>
<p>Most of the UCSC students who attend the SACNAS conference are involved in one of the programs Bell oversees, such as the <a href="http://stem.ucsc.edu/MARC-MBRS">Initiative for Maximizing Student Development</a> (IMSD), <a href="http://stem.ucsc.edu/MARC">Minority Access to Research Careers</a> (MARC), <a href="http://stem.ucsc.edu/CAMP">California Alliance for Minority Participation</a> (CAMP), and <a href="http://graddiv.ucsc.edu/ucleads/">UC LEADS</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;These special knights, dubbed the White Blood Cells, would protect the ill from invaders,&#8221; Pham recalled years later. &#8220;Growing up, I admired these little defenders of the weak for their selflessness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pham, a recent UCSC health sciences graduate, is closer to his dream of helping those knights. He is this year&#8217;s recipient of the prestigious Sutter Maternity &amp; Surgery Center Central California Alliance for Health Primary Care Physician Award.</p>
<p>Since 2007, Palo Alto Medical Foundation affiliate Sutter Maternity &amp; Surgery Center in Santa Cruz and the Central California Alliance for Health have awarded this scholarship to pay $10,000 toward the medical school fees of a UCSC health sciences graduate who wants to return to his or her local community to help underserved populations.</p>
<p>Pham, 22, is now attending med school at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, where he is interested in studying pediatrics and is committed to nutrition.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of what we see in medicine currently is the &#8216;last minute&#8217; kind of medicine&#8212;using our advanced techniques to save people&#8217;s lives because of long-term degradation,&#8221; Pham said. &#8220;Early education is so important, especially when it comes to children.&#8221;</p>
<p>He worked as an intern for a local Santa Cruz family doctor, and served on a medical mission to Honduras. Pham also volunteered at an East Palo Alto charter school&#8217;s healthy eating program and as a Spanish translator at the Watsonville RotaCare community clinic.</p>
<p>Dr. Larry deGhetaldi, CEO of Sutter Health&#8217;s Santa Cruz Area health care services, praised Pham&#8217;s combination of &#8220;head and heart. Our board met with him, and all of us picked up on that positive energy.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also said awards that encourage students to go into primary care are a matter of urgency. &#8220;I believe that half of the newly trained physician workforce should go into primary care. The future of high-quality affordable health care depends on it, but only 10 percent of medical school graduates end up in primary care.&#8221;</p>
<p>Primary care doctors are extremely important because &#8220;they look at the whole picture. Primary care physicians tend to be like David&#8212;very people oriented. They are generalists who deal with the total body and total social picture, culture perspectives, and biases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pham&#8217;s father emigrated from Vietnam to the United States in 1975, right after the fall of Saigon, while his mother arrived from that country in 1978, after living for three years under the Communist regime.</p>
<p>His parents, who met in Wisconsin and now live in Milpitas, Calif., did not push their son to follow a medical career.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think their main goal was just to raise the children in a peaceful environment and instill strong values in them,&#8221; said Pham.</p>
<p>Pham has realized, through experience, that doctors must be able to communicate in a compassionate and concise way with patients.</p>
<p>This realization occurred several years ago when he was visiting a hospital and saw a residing nurse communicating poorly with an anxious, elderly patient.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was very upset,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At the same time, it did not discourage me from going into medicine. In fact, it strengthened my resolve.&#8221;</p>
<p>To that end, he has worked to refine and improve his communication skills. He said that respect and clarity are of the utmost importance.</p>
<p>&#8220;A tiny bit of encouragement can change a person&#8217;s outlook completely,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The award-winning, Santa Barbara&#8211;based bimonthly launched in 2008, with a focus on groundbreaking research and innovative solutions to untenable problems, from e-waste to unsafe airlines to morbid obesity. The focus is on the big surprise, flipping conventional thinking.</p>
<p>The magazine&#8217;s just-below-the-national-radar status could change soon under the leadership of newly minted editor-in-chief Maria Streshinsky, 41 (Stevenson &#8216;91, comparative literature). This May, she left her managing editor post at the renowned magazine the <em>Atlantic</em> to lead a major re-launch of <em>Miller-McCune.</em></p>
<p>After quickly earning a cult following among academics and pundits alike, Miller-McCune grew to a print-edition subscriber base of 100,000 (the magazine is also available free online).</p>
<p>Still, there is plenty of room for growth; consider the number of subscribers for two other ideas-and-issues-based magazines: 1 million for the <em>New Yorker,</em> and 400,000 for the <em>Atlantic</em>. Streshinsky hopes a publicity blast will increase <em>Miller-McCune&#8217;</em>s impact.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a great platform,&#8221; Streshinsky said. &#8220;And we&#8217;re going to do it. We&#8217;re going to push this boulder up the hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sara Miller McCune, founder and executive chair of the magazine, said Streshinsky is just the right person to expand <em>Miller-McCune&#8217;</em>s presence in the national dialogue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maria brings to <em>Miller-McCune</em> a comprehensive knowledge of the publishing industry&#8217;s best practices,&#8221; said McCune, who oversees SAGE Publications, a large publisher of academic journals, textbooks, and reference materials.</p>
<p>Streshinsky hopes to use social media to increase the magazine&#8217;s reach.</p>
<p>This makes sense, considering the highly tweetable content. In May, Miller-McCune published a modest proposal from a group of self-described &#8220;invasivores.&#8221; These eco-minded gourmands want to combat non-native invasive plants and animals by frying them up for dinner. Apparently, the voracious Indo-Pacific lionfish is delicious when rolled in pancake batter and cooked with butter and lemon juice.</p>
<p>The magazine, which Streshinsky describes as nonpartisan, covers legal affairs, politics, health, media, culture, and education with a blend of &#8220;think-tank&#8221; brainstorming, readability, and, in some cases, shameless entertainment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want it to feel like &#8216;eat your peas,&#8221;&#8217; Streshinsky said. &#8220;The tone, the action, the beginning, middle, and end are all important. Is someone going to want to dig into the next piece, or are they going to feel like, &#8216;meh&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Streshinsky&#8217;s father, the late Ted Streshinksy, was an award-winning photo journalistwho covered the Berkeley free speech movement, the Black Panthers, and countercultural happenings for <em>Time, Life, Look,</em> and other publications. Her mother, Shirley Streshinsky, wrote &#8220;big, hard-hitting pieces&#8221; for <em>Redbook, Glamour,</em> and <em>Ladies Home Journal.</em></p>
<p>Activism and public advocacy have always been part of her life. &#8220;As a little girl, I heard Joan Baez at Berkeley&#8217;s City Hall,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Moving to Santa Cruz felt like an extension of what I knew and how people acted.&#8221;</p>
<p>After graduating from UCSC, she became an editor at <em>Via,</em> AAA&#8217;s magazine, and later, a contributor and editor at <em>Mother Jones</em> magazine. After moving to Washington, D.C., she worked as a programs analyst in the U.S. Department of the Interior before taking the managing editor position at the <em>Atlantic</em>.</p>
<p>She put in five years there. &#8220;I loved that place, and would have stayed a lot longer&#8221; if not for her unexpected opportunity to helm <em>Miller-McCune.</em></p>
<p>She was also eager to return to the West Coast and be closer to her family.</p>
<p>Streshinsky and her small crew put out their product in an historic, Spanish-style one-story building on Anacapa Street. Stepping outside, staffers can take in a view of the Santa Ynez Mountains before ducking back inside to edit stories about dangerous airlines, cyborg computers, and antipsychotic pharmaceuticals.

<p>&#8220;I love holding a magazine in my hand, carrying it around with me to the park and at the beach,&#8221; Streshinsky said. &#8220;I know you can do that with the iPad too, but I don&#8217;t care about scratching my magazine. I don&#8217;t care about getting sand in my magazine.&#8221;</p>

<br/>
Having earned her bachelors degree at UC Santa Cruz in the male-dominated disciplines of math and physics, she became interested in solar technology in graduate school, then broke into the building trades installing residential solar electric systems. That there was no one else in the business didn't slow her down.<br/>
<br/>
"Semiconductor devices that turn sunlight into electricity?" she says, still enthusiastic about the technology she's championed her whole career. "I mean, it's the coolest thing in the world! It really is."<br/>
<br/>
Building grid-connected photovoltaic systems in the early1990s, she quickly encountered daunting problems for solar homes. Utilities offered to pay only wholesale rates for home-made power, which made home photovoltaic power to the grid impractical and non-competitive.<br/>
<br/>
So Walpert went to Sacramento and got the law changed to permit "net metering," cutting the red tape utilities were introducing and forcing them to pay retail prices for energy produced by homeowners. "We fought it through," she says, "and we won." America has followed her lead, with the net metering she pushed for in California now the law in 46 states.<br/>
<br/>
By 2006, Walpert (Oakes '79) was looking for new challenges. "After 20-plus years of working in the photovoltaic industry," she says, "I felt that I had done everything there is to do in solar." That's when an old friend called from Tanzania, saying, "We really, really need solar here."<br/>
<br/>
For Tanzanians, the always-on grid power we take for granted is beyond reach. Prohibitively expensive to hook up in the few places it's available, Tanzanian grid power is also resolutely unreliable: the 14 percent of Tanzanians "on the grid" demand more power than the nation's power plants can generate. The result is widespread power rationing.<br/>
<br/>
Without reliable power, Tanzanians use kerosene lanterns for light. Even after state subsidies, though, a liter of kerosene costs about a day's wage. "Typically," Walpert says, "people say about a third of their income goes to buying kerosene for these lanterns." The lanterns, often little more than tin cans with wicks stuffed in, cast a weak light&#8212;enough to carry out household chores, but not enough to read by. Worse, they produce a toxic aerosol brew of volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, and fine soot, and cause an appalling number of burns and fires.<br/>
<br/>
In response, Walpert created <a href="http://www.tanzsolar.org/">TanzSolar</a>, which, since 2007, has brought simple, easy-to-use solar light kits to villagers in Northern Tanzania's rural Lake Zone. Consisting of a small solar panel, a battery, a charge controller, and LED bulbs, each kit produces a brighter, cheaper, safer light for work, study, and home security.<br/>
<br/>
A solar light costs TanzSolar about $40, half of which is defrayed by donations. Within a few months, the lamps earn back their price in unburned kerosene, and owners can put money they would have spent on kerosene to other essentials. Newer versions offer a USB port for charging cell phones.<br/>
<br/>
With TanzSolar launched, Walpert has turned the reins over to the Tanzanian staff and is now dedicating herself to fundraising. Her next challenge is the Africa Solar Fund, a nonprofit to help fund TanzSolar and similar initiatives in Africa.<br/>
<br/>
"We put 20 bucks to this light," Walpert says. To Americans, "it's a night at the movies, but these Tanzanians' lives are changed forever."</p>

(Photo by Heimo Schmidt)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In September 1987, Brian Watwood (Porter &#8216;73, sociology) was riding his bike down Edgewater Road in San Mateo when an oncoming car slammed into him head-on.</p>
<p>At the hospital, the doctor gave the self-described &#8220;jock&#8221; a grim diagnosis: he had sustained a C5-C6 spinal cord injury and would be an &#8220;incomplete quadriplegic&#8221; for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Watwood, a former mountain search-and-rescue team member and ski patrolman, spent five months in hospitals and rehabilitation centers. To his enormous frustration, he found it impossible to operate his own wheelchair. A tool for mobility became a form of confinement.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be able to drive a wheelchair was impossible for me,&#8221; says Watwood. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t feel it with my arms and hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of giving way to despair, he channeled his energy into helping other disabled people achieve independence, while using his formidable skills as a tinkerer. The result is the Wijit, a lever-operated driving and braking device that attaches to manual wheelchairs.</p>
<p>Now Watwood is using the product himself, while marketing and promoting his invention for others.</p>
<p>Watwood was a free-thinker before he attended UCSC, but his college years taught him the values of entrepreneurship and self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of UCSC students embrace the environment and philosophy of the campus,&#8221; says Watwood. &#8220;There&#8217;s a strong undercurrent that teaches you a lot of independence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watwood, who dabbled in mechanics when he was growing up, had no formal engineering training, but that didn&#8217;t stop him from pursuing his big idea. He moved to the Sacramento area and invested his own money in the project. He spent three-and-a-half years working with designers and engineers to develop a prototype.</p>
<p>Watwood began selling Wijits in 1997, and the product has gone through several redesigns since then. He took the frame-based Wijit off the market for more than five years, and launched the new wheel-based Wijit in 2006.</p>
<p>After surgery and years of rehabilitation, Watwood is now able to leave his wheelchair and move around, but he still takes the chair and his Wijit wherever he goes. His partial recovery earned him a new nickname: &#8220;SuperQuad.&#8221; In 1999, he was inducted into the National Hall of Fame for Persons with Disabilities.</p>
<p>A fellow Banana Slug teamed up with him to get the word out about Watwood&#8217;s project. Christine Lamson Taylor (Crown &#8216;90, economics) joined Wijit as CFO in March, after leaving a career as a partner with one of the &#8220;Big Four&#8221; accounting firms, Ernst &amp; Young.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe my decision to join Wijit links back to my time at UCSC,&#8221; says Taylor. &#8220;I was encouraged to be an idealist. UC Santa Cruz helped me become the person I am and shaped how I view the world today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor says the Wijit is a healthier alternative to power wheelchairs because it allows users to get a cardiovascular workout, which is crucial to maintaining a healthy weight. It also has the potential to prevent shoulder pain and injuries that are associated with using a manual chair.</p>
<p>In addition to her finance and operational responsibilities, Taylor spends time promoting the Wijit nationwide.</p>
<p>Seeing people try the product was life-changingfor her, she said. Those are the times she&#8217;s relieved to have left the corporate world behind.</p>
<p>Says Taylor, &#8220;Working with Brian allows me to be part of something that has the potential to affect the lives of so many people. This need to have a sense of purpose is based on my time in Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>

<br/>
The grant is one of 14 totaling $3.5 million from the California Postsecondary Education Commission's Improving Teacher Quality Program that links select high school districts with university schools of education.<br/>
<br/>
The objective is to help teachers prepare high school students for the rigor of college and career work through analytical reading and writing, as required by the new Common Core State Standards. The program, called Alliance for Language and Literary Instruction Effecting Standards (ALLIES), will work with up to 40 English teachers from Watsonville, Pajaro Valley, and Aptos high schools.<br/>
<br/>
The program begins with a kick-off institute today and Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
Common Core State Standards are part of a state-led effort within the national "Race to the Top" educational initiative to establish a shared set of clear standards for English language arts and mathematics. The state Postsecondary Education Commission says the new standards are different enough to warrant new teacher development.<br/>
<br/>
"We're really grateful for the grant because it will help our English teachers move away from the standards we have now to the Common Core Standards," said Murry Schekman, PVUSD's assistant superintendent for secondary education. "Working closely with the folks at UCSC in developing our methodology will be awesome," said Schekman, himself a UCSC alumnus.<br/>
<br/>
Judith Scott, associate professor of education at UC Santa Cruz, said the grant will be used to provide opportunities for teachers to meet with each other and local educational leaders to focus on effective teaching strategies. Teachers will meet monthly and attend intensive Saturday institutes developed by a consortium of education leaders from five different agencies including the UCSC Central California Writing Project, the UCSC Writing Program and Education Departments, PVUSD, and the Santa Cruz County Office of Education.<br/>
<br/>
High school teachers don't often have the opportunity to get together and share techniques and best practices. "Teaching is hard," Scott said. "It can be isolating." This program will give them the opportunity to work together with teacher educators and coaches to explore students&#8217; writing in depth.<br/>
<br/>
Joining Scott in leading the research component of the project is Lucinda Pease-Alvarez, associate professor of education. Louann Baker, co-director of the Central California Writing Project and a teacher supervisor at UCSC, is the project coordinator.<br/>
<br/>
Baker said the project will support the high school teachers to help students develop writing that reveals critical thinking about issues and problems. "Writing is thinking," Baker said. "Good writing is hard to assess," she said, explaining how good writing is critical for student success after high school whether in college or the workplace.<br/>
<br/>
The program will be evaluated after the first full year and funding could be extended for another year depending on performance.<br/>

<p>Charlie McDowell, professor of computer science and associate dean for undergraduate affairs in the Jack Baskin School of Engineering at UCSC, said adding new women to the U.S. tech talent pool is one of the goals of the Pacesetters program of the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT). As part of the NCWIT Pacesetters program, the Baskin School of Engineering is taking a leadership role to promote the meaningful participation of women and girls in computing and information technology. The school's faculty and staff have introduced a number of initiatives to encourage more participation of women in computing&#160; at UC Santa Cruz, McDowell said.</p>
<p>NCWIT Pacesetters is an accelerated program in which global corporations and academic institutions publicly commit to adding a goal number of "net new" women to their organizations. Increased diversity in the technology workforce has the potential to increase the size and talent of the U.S. workforce, improve innovation, and boost profits. Pacesetters organizations have set concrete goals for diversifying their organizations by implementing deep and accelerated changes: program and policy reforms, refined admissions criteria and curriculum, and improved perceptions about the value of women's technical contributions. Together, Pacesetters seek to add 1,000 net new women to the U.S. tech talent pool by 2012.</p>
<p>The Baskin School of Engineering's plan includes outreach efforts for middle school, high school, and current university students. The engineering school is reaching out to high school women through the Bay Area Affiliate of the NCWIT Aspirations in Computing Award, which encourages young women to continue to pursue their interests in computing and technology and works to gain greater visibility for the role of computing.</p>
<p>"There are many young women with the talent and skill to be great technologists, and we are committed to do everything we can to increase their awareness of the exciting opportunities available and encourage their technical interest and success," McDowell said.</p>
<p>Additional efforts by the Baskin School of Engineering to attract more young women to computing include a middle school summer camp called "Girls in Engineering," with a focus on computer science and engineering; an outreach "road-show" conducted at local high schools; and an NSF-funded scholarship and engineering learning community for incoming students.</p>
<p>The engineering school's approach includes outreach to prospective girls, "in-reach" to current UCSC women, and re-design of entry-level courses in computing, McDowell said. In the classroom, a two-quarter introductory programming course has been established to better accommodate those with no previous programming experience. Also, the "Introduction to Computer Science" course has been revamped.</p>
<p>"The course was recently redesigned with an eye towards drawing more women into computer science by helping them appreciate the broad impacts of the discipline and the wide range of intellectual endeavors involved," McDowell said.</p>
<p>This fall, the Baskin School of Engineering launched "Project Awesome," targeting first- and second-year female students at UCSC, including a new publication and website at <a href="http://awesome.soe.ucsc.edu/">awesome.soe.ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<p>"The growing national need for computer scientists and technologists will not be met without the meaningful participation of women and girls, and the Baskin School of Engineering is committed to inviting more women to shape the future of technology and computing," said Adrienne Harrell, director of undergraduate student affairs for the engineering school.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="36d64332807270460174aa06ac532666"><name>cyber-security-strong-passwords</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>National Cyber Security Awareness Month: Use strong passwords</title><start-date>1319443200000</start-date><display-name>cyber-security-strong-passwords</display-name><path>/2011/10/cyber-security-strong-passwords</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/10/cyber-security-strong-passwords</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1319474971265</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1319475051244</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong>October is National Cyber Security Awareness Month</strong></p>
<p>This is the perfect time <a href="http://its.ucsc.edu/policies/password.html">to change passwords that don&#8217;t meet UCSC&#8217;s Password Standards</a>.</p>
<p>Passwords are an important part of computer security at UCSC. They often serve as the first line of defense in preventing unauthorized access to campus computers and data. Because of this, it is important to choose passwords that are complex and cryptic enough to prevent others from guessing them or from cracking them with &#8220;password cracker&#8221; programs. At the same time, it is also important to keep passwords secret and secure so others can&#8217;t use them or find them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Passwords should be at least 8 characters long and use at least 3 of the following types of characters: upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and special characters (e.g. !@#$%^&amp;*()_+|&#126;-=\&#8216;{}[]:";&#8217;&lt;&gt;?,./)</li>
<li>Less complex passwords should be longer</li>
<li>Passwords shouldn't be a dictionary word whether spelled forwards or backwards, or a word preceded or followed by a digit (e.g., password1, 1password), your username, child's name, pet's name, birthdays, abc123, password1, or anything else easily guessable.</li>
<li>A phrase that is familiar to you might be a useful device to help you generate a password that is memorable to you, but obscure to others. For example, "The hills are alive with the sound of music!" is actually a pretty good password, except for the fact that that it is inconveniently long and published here. A shorter version using a variant on the first letter of each word could be, "ThRawts0m!"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Last but not least, keep your passwords secret.</strong> Don&#8217;t share them with anyone else. ITS will never ask you for your password. Neither should any reputable service provider.</p>

<p>More than 200 guests listened to the discussion at the UCSC Music Recital Hall with J. Michael Bishop, University Professor and chancellor emeritus at UCSF; Arthur D. Levinson, chairman and former CEO of Genentech; David Haussler, distinguished professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz; and moderator Moira Gunn of Tech Nation.</p>
<p>Bishop is celebrated for his work on the genetic basis of cancer, which remains the focus of research in his lab at UCSF. In 1989, Bishop and Harold Varmus won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their research on cancer genes.</p>
<p><strong>Sobering fact</strong></p>
<p>Bishop began his presentation with a sobering fact: cancer remains &#8220;one of the most fearsome adversaries of humankind. One out of three people in this room will develop cancer, and one out of four will die of cancer.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Bishop also spoke with excitement about personalized cancer care, a major focus of current research efforts. In personalized care, doctors design targeted treatments based on the genetic changes found in a patient's cancer cells.</p>
<p>Explaining the ways in which malfunctioning genes can cause cancer cells to multiply out of control, Bishop described oncogenes as acting like a jammed &#8220;accelerator,&#8221; while mutations in tumor-suppressor genes are like &#8220;defective brakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such malfunctions funnel into the genetic keyboard and cause disharmony, Bishop explained. &#8220;So we need to know every gene that is doing this, every gene that is malfunctioning. This is a huge enterprise, and it&#8217;s going to revolutionize (cancer treatment.)&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Cancer genomics</strong></p>
<p>Cancer genomics will be used for early detection, personalized therapy, and diagnostics, Bishop said.&#160; &#8220;Now we&#8217;re in a position to create &#8216;magic bullets.&#8217; &#8230; We can attack outlaw cells without necessarily harming innocent bystanders. We can inhibit jammed accelerators and restore the brakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next presenter, Levinson, who worked with Bishop and Varmus at UCSF as a postdoctoral researcher before joining Genentech in 1980, elaborated on some of the more &#8220;targeted approaches to cancer treatment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Levinson expressed his confidence that the scientific community will figure out a way to &#8220;solve cancer&#8221; by intercepting several cancer-causing proteins at once, &#8220;allowing us to stop the pathways of cancer and its resistance to treatment. If you blast at multiple points, you can suppress activity even of a rare resistant cell. I think it could happen in 10 to 15 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Genentech's successes in drug development include the cancer drugs Herceptin and Avastin, which are used in genetically targeted treatments.</p>
<p>While Levinson spoke with confidence about the fight against cancer, he said that much work remains to be done, and that one of the biggest remaining obstacles to progress could be economic, especially &#8220;in a time of declining resources for research and development and rising health care costs.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Genetic abnormalities cataloged<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>Haussler is involved in efforts to catalog genetic abnormalities found in different types of cancers and find links between specific genetic changes and the ways that patients respond to different treatments.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time the digital age meets cancer head on, and we can do this with the technology we have,&#8221; Haussler said. &#8220;With the community&#8217;s help, we can bring bold, new information technology to the battle against cancer.&#8221;</p>
<p>UCSC is famous for its genomic database.&#160; In the summer of 2000, shortly after the announcement of the first sequenced human genome, the entire sequence was posted on the internet for the first time from UC Santa Cruz. The website attracts 17 million hits per month from hundreds of thousands of biomedical researchers. Now Haussler is working to build a database of cancer genomics.</p>
<p>While Bishop went into detail about personalized cancer treatment, he emphasized that the most effective way of controlling cancer is still prevention.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;Vaccines prevent smallpox and measles,&#8221; and while there&#8217;s no all-purpose vaccine that stops cancer, people can now avail themselves of vaccines against the hepatitis B virus, a leading risk factor for cancer. People can also stop smoking and be careful to avoid sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Bishop and Levinson were honored by the UC Santa Cruz Foundation during the annual Founders Celebration. During last week&#8217;s 2011 Founders Celebration Dinner, they received the Foundation Medal, which recognizes individuals of exceptionally distinguished achievement whose work and contribution to society illustrate the ideals and vision of UC Santa Cruz.

<br/>
Well, we can't bring you the redwoods or the ocean ... but we might be able to help with a few of the other things you miss about UCSC. <br/>
<br/>
Our regional program offers a way to meet up with new and old UCSC friends and reconnect with the campus&#8212;near where you live. <br/>
<br/>
There are UCSC events in California, the East Coast, the Pacific Northwest, Hawaii, and other locations. They are organized by the UCSC University Relations office or by alumni volunteers. <br/>
<br/>
Recent events have included an LA summer soiree, a Boston clambake, schmoozing with politicos in Sacramento, and meetups in Washington, D.C., and Hawaii. <br/>
<br/>
Ocean sciences professor Gary Griggs gave a talk in Boulder, San Francisco alumni attended panels on politics and climate change, and young Silicon Valley alumni career-networked at Google with alumni mentors from Pixar and Adobe, along with other successful entrepreneurs. <br/>
<br/>
If there isn't a group in your area, you can create one and volunteer to put on events. <br/>

<p>More than a thousand people flocked to the Cowell College Courtyard to celebrate the weekend&#8217;s festivities, enjoying food, beverages, college and department exhibits, and a lineup of spectacular student entertainment.</p>
<p>On Saturday, UCSC alumni Michael Wilson (Stevenson, &#8216;84), a pioneer in the emerging field of &#8220;green&#8221; chemistry, and Drummond Pike (Stevenson &#8216;70), founder of Tides Foundation, headlined the Intellectual Forum at the Humanities Lecture Hall. Kimberly Lau, provost of UCSC &#8216;s Oakes College, moderated the discussion, which focused on creating a paradigm shift in our collective approach to meeting social, environmental, and economic challenges.</p>
<p>Alumni and friends also gathered for events including dinners and wine tasting.</p>

<h3>'Party Patrols' planned</h3>
<p>Santa Cruz and UCSC Police have scheduled another round of party patrols, for <strong>Friday and Saturday nights, October 28 and 29</strong>.</p>
<p>As has been the case during past weekends this quarter, the focus of these patrols will be large and out-of-control parties in Westside Santa Cruz neighborhoods.</p>
<p>As reported in police logs, "party patrols" performed by the Santa Cruz and UCSC police from September 16 through October 15 have resulted in:<br/>
<br/>
&#8226; 126 student parties visited<br/>
&#8226; 5 parties dispersed<br/>
&#8226; 32 party hosts warned and the address flagged under the city's "loud and unruly" ordinance<br/>
&#8226; 63 citations issued<br/>
&#8226; 9 arrests</p>
<p>Information about hosting smaller, safer parties is available at <a href="mailto:shop@ucsc.edu">shop@ucsc.edu</a>. Request the Red Cup Brochure.</p>
</div>
<p>Each year, SHOP designs new T-shirts featuring the "Party small" gnome, which helps publicize a campaign that provides education about the risks of excessive drinking, along with drinking-related accidents and crimes. This year's T-shirt design has a brand-new theme: "Gnome Your Limits." Last year's was "Gnomeland Security."</p>
<p>SHOP is also distributing <a href="http://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/forms/RedCupgnomebrochure.pdf">informational brochures</a> to Santa Cruz neighbors, UCSC residential colleges, and program offices.</p>
<p>SHOP also coordinates a separate, safety-related program, <a href="http://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/shop/alcohol_edu.shtml">AlcoholEdu</a>, a three-hour online prevention course mandated for UCSC students 24 years old and younger.</p>
<p>UCSC's campaign is part of the Safer CA Universities Project (SCUP) which began as a statewide research study involving fourteen UC and Cal State Universities. The main focus is "large, out-of-control student parties off campus," said Paul Willis, SHOP's alcohol and other drug educator.</p>
<p>Part of the community-wide safety campaign also includes increased enforcement during the first six weeks of the fall quarter in neighborhoods near campus. UCSC Police, Santa Cruz Police, and California Highway Patrol (CHP) are all involved in "party patrols" and other enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>For the past three academic years, UCSC has provided money to the Santa Cruz Police Department to fund voluntary overtime for officers on the weekends during the academic year for enforcement of the city's "loud and unruly noise ordinance" and to respond to large parties. Executive Vice Chancellor/Campus Provost Alison Galloway approved the campus expenditure of $25,000 for the 2011-12 academic year to continue the partnership program with the city.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www1.ucsc.edu/administration/gcr/GoodNeighborBrochure.pdf</url><title>Good Neighbor Initiative brochure</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3d898ccb807270460174aa06a2d68cdb"><name>review-fall-2011-philanthropy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Philanthropy Focus: Three Shakespeare Santa Cruz benefactors aim to make sure the show will go on</title><start-date>1319529600000</start-date><display-name>Philanthropy Focus</display-name><path>/2011/10/review-fall-2011-philanthropy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/10/review-fall-2011-philanthropy</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1319587384429</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1321405458820</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Amy Ettinger</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/10/images/ssc.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/10/images/ssc.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ssc.jpg</name><display-name>ssc.jpg</display-name><file-size>89980</file-size><width>300</width><height>179</height></image><image-alt>SSC scene</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Watching a Shakespeare play among the redwoods is a quintessential UC Santa Cruz experience.

With a boost from UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal, this formidable trio has stepped in to give the theater company a hefty financial lift with a $100,000 matching gifts program.</p>
<p>Stanley, SSC&#8217;s founding artistic director; Sinsheimer, the founding board chair; and Hyatt, who served on the SSC board for seven years, agreed to donate up to $70,000 in a matching gifts program to honor the 30th anniversary season. Then Blumenthal agreed to commit $30,000 out of his discretionary gift fund, bringing the matching gift figure up to $100,000.</p>
<p>Stanley and Sinsheimer are two names that many theater patrons associate with SSC. In fact, the full name of the redwood-lined outdoor venue where many performances take place is the Karen Sinsheimer/Audrey Stanley Festival Glen.</p>
<p>Sinsheimer spoke of the &#8220;huge challenges&#8221; facing all cultural and artistic nonprofit organizations in lean economic times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Often, it forces people to focus their contributions on perhaps fewer organizations, but those in which they believe wholeheartedly,&#8221; Sinsheimer said. &#8220;Our job is to make the case for SSC, which is known for its superb quality.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From my own experience, I know that everyone feels better because their precious discretionary dollars go further when they are matched,&#8221; Sinsheimer said. &#8220;I especially wanted to make a pledge to Shakespeare Santa Cruz in their 30th year because I believe SSC truly has come of age.&#8221;</p>
<p>This campaign is part of a wider effort to preserve SSC far into the future, Hyatt said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We never have to worry about losing SSC if sponsors and patrons realize that they can help,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Patrons can help ensure that SCC has a reliable source of yearly funding, Hyatt continued. &#8220;That leaves the fundraisers and the board free to explore new funding avenues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Throughout this campaign, which lasts through the end of the year, gifts and pledges to the Shakespeare Santa Cruz 30th Anniversary Challenge Match will be matched dollar-for-dollar up to $100,000. For example, a $5,000 gift or pledge will result in $10,000 in support for SSC.</p>
<p>This formula brings maximum benefit from every dollar that goes to the award-winning theater company, Sinsheimer said.</p>
<p>Stanley praised Hyatt for making the first move&#8212;Hyatt started the process by offering a generous donation. At that point, Stanley and Sinsheimer jumped in, and so did Blumenthal.</p>
<p>&#8220;His gift represents far more to me than just money,&#8221; Stanley said. &#8220;It acknowledges the level of achievement for UCSC that the theater company has presented and reached for over 30 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no coincidence that there is a &#8220;30&#8221; at the front of the chancellor&#8217;s donation; the trio of donors created the fundraising campaign to honor SSC&#8217;s 30th anniversary season, which continues through the year with performances of the fall benefit show <em>Bard Babes</em> in November and the holiday show <em>A Year with Frog &amp; Toad</em> in November and December.</p>
<p>While the challenge grant is in progress, Shakespeare Santa Cruz&#8217;s annual fund campaign will continue to raise income, as well.</p>

The event drew a crowd of 350 people to the Cocoanut Grove in Santa Cruz last Friday night.</p>
<p>UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal, who congratulated each of <a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/founders/2011/honorees.html">this year's honorees</a>, described a number of recent campus achievements. "Indeed, Britain's Times Higher Education just ranked UC Santa Cruz <a href="world-university-rankings.xml">third in the world for the impact of our research</a>, behind only MIT and Princeton," the chancellor said.</p>
<p>Blumenthal also described the way UCSC "continues to dominate the discovery of new planets. And we continue to propel the world's understanding of evolution. And nobody knows Charles Dickens like we do. Just read the recent <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/08/29/110829fa_fact_lepore">New Yorker article</a> on the "Dickens Universe."</p>
<p>Blumenthal also made special mention of UCSC biomolecular engineering professor <a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/haussler">David Haussler</a> for having assembled "a team that is quintessentially UC Santa Cruz: brilliant, bike-riding computer geniuses who are changing the world."</p>
<p>The following individuals were honored at the Founders Dinner:</p>
<p>&#8226; <a href="http://porter.ucsc.edu/news-events/featured-profiles/julia-sweig.html">Julia Sweig</a> (Porter '86, Latin American studies), an internationally recognized authority on Latin America and U.S. foreign policy, especially with respect to Cuba, who received the Alumni Achievement Award, given annually by the UCSC Alumni Association.</p>

In the first thorough assessment of the effects of high nutrient levels on the ecosystems of Elkhorn Slough, researchers have mapped out the extent of the problem and identified ways to improve conditions at many sites.</p>
<p>The study shows that virtually every portion of the estuary is affected by over-enrichment, with consequences ranging from thick algal mats floating on the surface to low night-time oxygen levels and reduced biodiversity. Published in the current issue of the journal <em>Marine Ecology Progress Series</em>, the study was conducted by a team of researchers from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve.</p>
<p>"We've given the estuary a report card, and a lot of sites do not get passing grades," said coauthor Kerstin Wasson, research coordinator for the reserve and an adjunct associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>According to Brent Hughes, first author of the study and a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz, the main source of the excess nutrients is probably fertilizer in runoff from agricultural fields. Water with high nutrient loads enters the slough not only from the Elkhorn Slough watershed, but also from the lower Salinas Valley and Tembladero watersheds, which drain into Moss Landing Harbor at the mouth of the slough through the old Salinas River channel.</p>
<p>"Water from the old Salinas River channel enters the harbor, and the tides pump that water all the way up the entire slough," Hughes said.</p>
<p>The parts of the slough that show the most extreme symptoms of over-enrichment are upstream of water control structures that restrict the movement of water as the tides rise and fall. These sites have low biodiversity, lacking the large fish and abundant shorebirds found in nearby sites with more tidal exchange. While the ultimate solution to the effects of excess nutrients on the estuary is to reduce nutrient inputs, wetland managers can enhance local water quality by increasing tidal exchange to sites with tide gates or other water control structures, Wasson said.</p>
<p>The excess nutrients stimulate the growth of algae, adding to the amount of organic matter in the system. Called eutrophication, this can lead to low oxygen levels and even "dead zones" as the organic matter decomposes. Hughes and his coauthors developed a eutrophication index to characterize the extent of the problem at 18 sites in the slough, using data from water quality monitoring programs and other measurements. The index scores are represented on a map of the slough in colors ranging from green, for low eutrophication, to red, for extreme symptoms of nutrient enrichment.</p>
<p>The variation between sites in physical factors and in symptoms of eutrophication allowed Hughes to conduct statistical tests to identify which factors best predicted the site-level eutrophication scores. The factor that showed the strongest relationship with severity of eutrophication symptoms was tidal exchange. Tidal exchange is strongest near the mouth of the estuary, the only portion of the estuary to get a low score and appear green on the map. Proceeding up the main channel of the estuary, the rate at which water is exchanged with Monterey Bay decreases and the eutrophication score transitions from yellow to orange at the upper end.</p>
<p>"Blooms of algae occur throughout the whole slough, but the parts near the mouth are deeper and more affected by tidal flushing, so the water doesn't become stagnant and you don't see the same consequences that you see where there is less tidal exchange," Hughes said.</p>
<p>Tidal exchange is artificially restricted at many sites in the estuary, with water control structures such as culverts or tide gates placed in levees, which were built many years ago to protect human land uses from flooding. About a third of the tidelands in the estuary have such restricted tidal exchange, where there is less mixing with fresh ocean water than in areas near the mouth of the slough. Algal mats in these areas are retained rather than swept away by currents, leading to an accumulation of organic matter that fuels microbial growth and leads to heavy consumption of oxygen at night, resulting in low-oxygen conditions that can harm fish and other animals. The researchers found that all sites with the highest scores ("hyper-eutrophic"), were behind water control structures.</p>
<p>"Low dissolved oxygen is really problematic because the fish need oxygen in the water," Hughes said. "Where the slough is hyper-eutrophic, we see fewer fish and invertebrates. It really cuts down on the diversity of the system."</p>
<p>According to Wasson, local management of water control structures can improve conditions at individual sites for the benefit of the fish and birds that use these areas. "Opening tide gates just a bit wider at those sites that are currently colored red for highly eutrophic would convert them to orange or yellow--moderately eutrophic--and dramatically improve ecological conditions for fish and wildlife," she said.</p>
<p>In addition to Wasson and Hughes, the coauthors of the paper include John Haskins and Elizabeth Watson at the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve. This research was supported by the Elkhorn Slough Foundation, Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, California Environmental Protection Agency, Monterey Community Foundation, and NOAA.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="471664ee807270460174aa069e16f153"><name>growth-rates</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Study finds early growth trajectories have long-term effects on fitness</title><summary>Researchers describe how food supply and environmental conditions affect the growth rates of organisms, which in turn influence future survival and reproduction.</summary><keywords>Marc Mangel, CSTAR, Center for Stock Assessment Research, growth rates</keywords><start-date>1319702400000</start-date><display-name>Early growth rates and long-term fitness</display-name><path>/2011/10/growth-rates</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/10/growth-rates</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1319747609717</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1319747830088</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Applied Mathematics and Statistics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/10/images/sticklebacks_01-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/10/images/sticklebacks_01-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sticklebacks_01-375.jpg</name><display-name>sticklebacks_01-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>54402</file-size><width>375</width><height>230</height></image><image-alt>stickleback fish</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/10/images/sticklebacks-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/10/images/sticklebacks-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sticklebacks-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>sticklebacks-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18342</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Studies of three-spined sticklebacks showed that environmentally-induced alterations in the early growth pattern led to a reduction in reproductive performance later in life.

A new study by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the University of Glasgow shows how mathematical models can be used to characterize and quantify these effects.</p>
<p>"Over the last fifteen years, we have recognized that events early in the life of organisms, including people, can have great consequences for health in later life," said Marc Mangel, distinguished professor of applied mathematics and statistics in the Baskin School of Engineering at UCSC and senior author of the study, published in the journal <em>American Naturalist.</em></p>
<p>The paper describes complex patterns of feeding, growth rates, and reproductive success in fish. First author Who-Seung Lee worked on the study as an associate specialist at UC Santa Cruz and a graduate student at the University of Glasgow. He is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Quebec in Montreal.</p>
<p>The researchers investigated the optimal rates of growth under different environmental conditions for fish and other "cold-blooded" animals (known as ectotherms). In these animals, growth is sensitive to ambient temperature even when food is not limiting. Compensatory growth can make up for a period of slow growth early in life, resulting in normal adult size, but the costs of an accelerated growth rate can reduce fitness. Costs may include increased exposure to predators due to more active foraging behavior, as well as increased accumulation of biomolecular damage during periods of higher metabolic rates.</p>
<p>"One expected consequence of climate change is that fish will experience growth conditions quite different from the ones in which they evolved. Our work suggests that even if it appears that a fish has 'caught up' when a period of poor growth is followed by one of good growth, there may be unforeseen consequences for its survival and reproduction, and our work provides a framework for assessing these consequences," said Mangel, who directs the <a href="http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/%7Emsmangel/CSTAR.html">Center for Stock Assessment Research</a> (CSTAR), a collaboration between UCSC and NOAA Fisheries Service labs.</p>
<p>The researchers developed a range of life-history models of increasing complexity, with different scenarios for the trade-offs between early growth rate and accumulation of damage. They compared the predictions of the models with experimental results from three-spined sticklebacks induced by temperature manipulations to follow three different growth trajectories. The results showed that environmentally-induced alterations in the early growth pattern lead to a reduction in reproductive performance later in life. These reproductive effects appear to result from changes in the rate of accumulation of physiological damage.</p>
<p>The models and experiments also showed "negative compensatory growth" after an earlier period of higher temperature, with growth rates suppressed in comparison with animals that had been at a constant temperature. The decelerated growth had a positive effect, with both models and data showing that fish undergoing rapid growth early in life but suppressed growth in the lead-up to the breeding season would perform better than those growing steadily throughout their juvenile life.</p>
<p>This study shows that, despite the clear costs of impaired development in early life, life-history strategies can reduce these negative effects so as to maximize expected reproductive success. Thus, animal growth trajectories may take account of the long-term consequences of different growth rates, as well as the current ecological conditions.</p>

<div><span>I hope this message finds you doing&#160;well as we approach fall mid-terms. One of my roles as AVC of Auxiliary Services&#160;is to provide you with information&#160;that helps you to make safe&#160;choices. I hope you&#160;find the information below of use as you plan how and where to&#160;spend your time on Halloween this year.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the&#160;University and the City of Santa Cruz, I encourage you to&#160;avoid downtown Santa Cruz on&#160;Halloween night by&#160;instead choosing to come to&#160;or remain on campus and&#160;participating in one or more of the many programs offered&#160;throughout our college and residential communities. Please see&#160;<a href="http://studentservices.ucsc.edu/calendar-events/halloween-2011.html">this web page</a>&#160;for a listing of programs being hosted on campus.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>In past years on&#160;Halloween,&#160;the downtown has been marred by incidents of&#160;violence including stabbings. The&#160;City of Santa Cruz has been very clear that there is a zero&#160;tolerance&#160;policy for those who disrupt the safety of&#160;the community &#8212; and they are concerned for community members who&#160;may&#160;unintentionally become victims&#160;of violence.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>If, however, you choose&#160;to go downtown, please be advised:</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>&#8226; UCSC will operate Night&#160;Owl buses on a "weekend" schedule departing from downtown&#160;Santa Cruz approximately every 20 minutes from 11:45 p.m. until&#160;2:50 a.m. Halloween night.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>&#8226; Bus services from the&#160;downtown area may be limited and you may find yourself walking&#160;back up to campus. Should you have to walk back to&#160;campus,&#160;please remember to be good neighbors (i.e., respect the city&#160;noise ordinance, traffic laws and the property of others). Try&#160;to walk home with&#160;others as it can be very dark along several&#160;sections of the walk back to campus.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>&#8226; Be advised that the&#160;downtown area has been designated a "triple fine" area on&#160;Halloween for violations of city ordinances. Should you be involved&#160;in&#160;any incident for which you are cited by the City of Santa Cruz&#160;Police, you will also be referred to Student Judicial Affairs&#160;for possible University&#160;judicial action.</span></div>
<div><span>&#160;<br/>
In addition to the&#160;above, the City of Santa Cruz Police Department has asked the&#160;University to share the following with UCSC students:<br/>
&#160;<br/>
"If&#160;you are planning to come to downtown Santa Cruz on Halloween&#160;night, we ask that you have fun and behave responsibly. With&#160;the well-being of our&#160;residents and visitors in mind, the&#160;City has concentrated resources downtown to promote a safe&#160;environment that everyone can enjoy. This includes over 100&#160;law enforcement officers from 9 agencies patrolling the&#160;downtown corridor and triple fines for certain violations of&#160;the Municipal Code. Triple fines and court&#160;costs make an&#160;alcoholic open container violation total $480, and littering&#160;almost $300."<br/>
&#160;<br/>

&#160;<br/>
I hope that you have a fun and safe time this&#160;Halloween.</span></div></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Students</audience><admin>Sue Matthews, Associate Vice Chancellor</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4b375e65807270460174aa06af144c56"><name>norris-lecture</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Panelists to discuss renewable energy from the ocean in annual Norris Lecture Nov. 10</title><summary>Panelists will explore the current prospects of deriving renewable energy from the ocean in the annual Ken Norris Memorial Lecture at the Seymour Center on Thursday, November 10.</summary><keywords>renewable energy, Norris Lecture, Seymour Center</keywords><start-date>1319788800000</start-date><display-name>Renewable energy from the ocean</display-name><path>/2011/10/norris-lecture</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/10/norris-lecture</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1319816879610</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1319816956273</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/10/images/laird.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/10/images/laird.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>laird.jpg</name><display-name>laird.jpg</display-name><file-size>49019</file-size><width>159</width><height>239</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>John Laird</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Panelists will explore the current prospects of deriving renewable energy from the ocean in the annual Ken Norris Memorial Lecture at the Seymour Center at Long Marine Laboratory on Thursday, November 10, at 7 p.m. The event, "Renewable Energy from the Sea," is free and open to the public.

<br/>
<a href="http://seminars.uctv.tv">UCTV Seminars</a> is a site where UC researchers can share their work with scholars around the system and the world. It is now live and accepting submissions at <a href="http://seminars.uctv.tv">http://seminars.uctv.tv</a>. The site offers an easy-to-navigate user interface that allows visitors to browse videos by subject area, event date, speaker name, conference, host organization or UC campus.</p>
<p>Presentations must originate from a UC campus or affiliated institution but can feature researchers from universities around the world and can be freely viewed in Flash format, downloaded as audio and/or video podcasts, and embedded in outside web sites. Presentations are also made available on UCTV Seminars&#8217; YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/uctvseminars) and on UCTV&#8217;s iTunesU channel.<br/>
<br/>
UC researchers are invited to submit their own video presentations. Formats can range from a simple narrated PowerPoint presentation to a highly produced video. Programs will appear alongside user-submitted metadata, including descriptions, related links, lecture notes, and other complementary materials.&#160;&#160;<br/>
<br/>
&#160;For more than a decade, UCTV has gathered and disseminated general interest programming from throughout the University of California to more than 23 million homes nationwide on satellite and cable, and worldwide on its web site and YouTube and iTunesU channels. Content is intended for the general public, with additional content aimed at K-12 teachers and health care professionals.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years, UC faculty have expressed interest in making seminar presentations available to fellow scholars online, while also having access to other seminars from throughout the system. Unlike videos created for broadcast, these scholarly presentations require less production effort&#8212; minimally just the audio and the PowerPoint of the presentation. While some departments and conference organizers offer these kinds of presentations online after a seminar or conference has occurred, most are lost to anyone not directly participating.<br/>

<p>The UCSC project, "Screening for cholera biofilm inhibitors," competed against projects from the other campuses in the QB3 consortium, UC Berkeley and UCSF. The Award for Innovation recognizes research that has the potential to improve human health. The competition, which was open to graduate students, postdocs, staff scientists, or teams working in QB3 laboratories, began with 38 nominees, who were evaluated by a jury panel drawn from industry, venture capital, academia, and the media. The five finalists then competed for online votes from the three campus communities. More than 1,500 votes were cast, over half of them for the UCSC team. (See <a href="http://qb3.org/news/articles/2011/10/uc-santa-cruz-cholera-biofilm-team-wins-deloitte-qb3-award-innovation-0">QB3 story</a> for more details.)</p>
<p>The UCSC team consists of Kelly Peach, a graduate student in chemistry and biochemistry; Nicholas Shikuma, a graduate student in microbiology and environmental toxicology; and Walter Bray, a research specialist in the UCSC Chemical Screening Center. They developed a screening procedure to identify compounds that can stop cholera bacteria from forming antibiotic-resistant biofilms.</p>
<p>Many bacteria that cause infections and disease, including those that cause cholera, are known to form biofilms. These tough aggregates of bacteria are resistant to traditional antibacterial treatments and to attacks by the immune system. Although biofilms are involved in 60 percent of all human bacterial infections, there are no commercially available therapies for preventing biofilm formation. Peach, Shikuma, and Bray have developed the first high-throughput, image-based assay for cholera biofilm inhibitors. The assay, which can be performed in one day, streamlines the process of identifying inhibitors and will provide compounds that could be used as coatings for medical implants or as components of antibiotic cocktails.</p>
<p>Peach works with Roger Linington, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry, whose research group focuses on marine microorganisms as a source of natural products for drug discovery efforts. Shikuma works with Fitnat Yildiz, associate professor of microbiology and environmental toxicology, whose research focuses on cholera bacteria and the role of biofilms in seasonal epidemics of cholera. Bray, who earned an M.S. in molecular, cell and developmental biology at UCSC, manages the operations of the <a href="http://chemscreen.ucsc.edu/">Chemical Screening Center</a>, where advanced robotic systems are used to search for biologically active compounds with potential for fighting diseases or other uses.</p>
<p>QB3 is a consortium of three UC campuses that fosters collaborations among scientific faculty to enhance innovation and discovery. QB3 is collaborating with Deloitte in the institute's efforts to convert bioscience innovation into a driver for jobs, companies, and better health in California.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5ba836518072704601757f4f43bdd352"><name>sikh-conference</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC presents inaugural Sikh and Punjabi Studies conference Nov. 10-12</title><summary>On November 10-12, leading scholars from the United States, Canada, and England will come together for the inaugural conference in Sikh and Punjabi Studies at UC Santa Cruz.</summary><keywords>Sikhs, Sikh and Punjabi studies, Punjabi, uc santa cruz, ucsc</keywords><start-date>1320094200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC presents  Sikh and Punjabi Studies conference</display-name><path>/2011/10/sikh-conference</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/10/sikh-conference</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1320092710386</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1320094214424</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport   </name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu </email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/10/images/sikh-image-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/10/images/sikh-image-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sikh-image-350.jpg</name><display-name>sikh-image-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>39484</file-size><width>350</width><height>241</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/10/images/sikh-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/10/images/sikh-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sikh-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>sikh-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21858</file-size><width>81</width><height>81</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/10/images/singh-n-200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/10/images/singh-n-200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>singh-n-200.jpg</name><display-name>singh-n-200.jpg</display-name><file-size>33230</file-size><width>200</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Nirivikar Singh, UCSC professor of economics and&#160;Sarbjit Singh Aurora Chair in Sikh and Punjabi Studies</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>On November 10-12, leading scholars from the United States, Canada, and&#160;England will come together for the inaugural conference in Sikh and Punjabi Studies at UC Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
Titled <strong>Sikh and Punjabi Studies: Achievements and New Directions</strong>, participants will consider and discuss the current and future state of the field.<br/>
<br/>
The three-day event is open to scholars and students from all disciplines--including those enrolled in UCSC's inaugural class on the Sikhs--as well as interested members of the general public.<br/>
<br/>
The Humanities Division conference will include sessions covering history, philosophy, language, literature, political economy, musicology, and contemporary society.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
UC Santa Cruz is close to the San Francisco Bay Area, which has one of the largest concentrations of Sikhs in North America. The conference especially welcomes attendance by community members.</p>
<p>This fall quarter, UCSC has launched the campus&#8217; first course in its new Sikh and Punjabi Studies program. Titled <em>Introduction to the Sikhs</em>, the class is taught by professor of economics Nirvikar Singh&#8212;who was appointed Sarbjit Singh Aurora Chair in Sikh and Punjabi Studies last December.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>The endowed chair was established at UC Santa Cruz through the Sikh Foundation by Hardit and Harbhajan K. Singh in memory of their son, Sarbjit Singh Aurora.</p>
<p>It supports research and teaching in Sikh and Punjabi studies from a multicultural and global perspective.</p>
<p>There are approximately 20 million Sikhs in the world today, with significant communities living in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Kenya, Fiji, Thailand, Singapore, Maylaysia, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The ancestral home of the Sikhs is the Punjab region, divided between Pakistan and northern India.</p>
<p>Sikhs arrived in California more than a century ago, and their descendants today are engaged in activities ranging from high-tech entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley to farming in the Central Valley.</p>
<p>The UCSC conference begins with a welcome dinner at the University&#160;Center at 7 pm on Nov. 10, and concludes with a closing diner on November 12 at the Cowell Provost House.<br/>

<br/>
 <span>Faculty and staff will see only modest increases in medical plan costs for 2012, with 70 percent of employees seeing increases of less than $10 each month.&#160; In some instances, rates will actually go down next year.&#160; UC continues to cover 87 percent of premium costs.&#160; See the complete list of 2012 health care rates on At Your Service (<a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/employees/health_welfare/medical/medical-plan-costs-2012.html">http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/employees/health_welfare/medical/medical-plan-costs-2012.html</a>).<br/>
 Note:&#160; Rates for union-represented employees are subject to ongoing collective bargaining as appropriate.</span><br/>
<br/>
 <span>Last year, UC introduced the Health Net Blue &amp; Gold HMO, which offers the same benefit features as the Health Net HMO but with a smaller network of doctors and hospitals at a lower monthly premium cost.&#160; Despite efforts of our campus leadership and our colleagues at Office of the President, there has been no change in contracted medical groups in Santa Cruz or Santa Clara counties for the Health Net Blue &amp; Gold plan for 2012, although there were some additions for Alameda and San Mateo counties.&#160; This means that Palo Alto Medical Foundation Santa Cruz and Camino Medical Group will not be a provider option under the lower cost Blue &amp; Gold plan.&#160; Campus leadership will continue to work with UCOP to expand provider group options for the Blue &amp; Gold network for UCSC employees.</span><br/>
<br/>
 <span>UC continues to offer several medical plans from which to choose.&#160; Each plan provides comprehensive coverage, including behavioral health benefits.&#160; But the cost, both in terms of premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, as well as provider choice and flexibility to use out-of-network doctors and hospitals, varies significantly.</span><br/>
<br/>
 <span>Please take time to review your 2012 options and choose the medical plan that best fits your needs.&#160; Open Enrollment booklets were mailed to your home last week.&#160; There are also tools on the Open Enrollment web site (<a href="http://www.atyourservice.ucop.edu/open_enrollment">http://www.atyourservice.ucop.edu/open_enrollment</a>) to help you compare plans and find the one that&#8217;s right for you and your family.</span><br/>
<br/>
 <span>If you have questions or need assistance with your enrollment decisions, consider attending an Open Enrollment presentation.&#160; Schedules may be found on the UCSC Open Enrollment web site (<a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/open_enrollment_2012.htm">http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/open_enrollment_2012.htm</a>).&#160; For individual assistance, please contact the Benefits Office at (831) 459-2013.&#160;</span></big></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Academic and Staff Employees</audience><admin>Charlotte Moreno, Assistant Vice Chancellor, Staff Human Resources ; Pamela Peterson, Assistant Vice Chancellor, Academic Personnel</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="c454b06d8072704601015f884b2ead78"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1317456000000</start-date><path>/2011/10/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/10/index</link><created-by>jward1</created-by><created-on>1296079040570</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1311616104657</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
