<div>&#160;</div>
<div>Designed and implemented by Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS), the survey collects information about the travel choices and preferences made by students, staff and faculty who traveled to and from UCSC facilities last week. In conjunction with other transportation information, the results of the Transportation Survey will help campus planners monitor the effectiveness of existing programs and services. 
<div>&#160;</div>
</div>
<div>Your responses also help gauge the factors that encourage or inhibit use of sustainable transportation alternatives, while a &#8220;Comments&#8221; area provides an opportunity to share your ideas, suggestions and feedback. By comparing these results with similar surveys conducted over the past twelve years, certain trends&#8212;such as growing support for &#8220;green&#8221; travel choices&#8212;can be analyzed and documented. Ultimately, these findings will help TAPS provide new, improved, and expanded programs and services to the campus community.&#160;</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>Those who complete the survey no later than Friday, June 3rd, may enter their name and contact information to win one of five $50 gift certificates to the Bay Tree Bookstore.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>

In his new book, <em>First Life</em> (UC Press, June 2011)<em>,</em> Deamer presents a personal history of his work in this field, while also providing an engaging and accessible overview of research into life's beginnings.</p>
<p>The book describes this research within the framework of a new scientific discipline called astrobiology, which studies the origin and evolution of life on Earth in a broader cosmic context. "Astrobiology is a narrative that encompasses our understanding of star formation, the formation of our solar system, the early Earth environment, and how chemical compounds behave in such a way that they are driven toward increasing complexity of structures and interactions," said Deamer, a research professor of biomolecular engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The main focus of his research has been the role of membranes in the origins of life. He began his career studying the biophysics of cell membranes, which are made of molecules called lipids. In the 1980s, he demonstrated that meteorites contain lipid-like molecules capable of forming stable membranes. More recently, research in Deamer's lab has shown that lipid membranes have an organizing effect on other molecules that helps small molecules join together to form longer polymers similar to the nucleic acids RNA and DNA, which are essential to all known forms of life.</p>
<p>This organizing effect of membranes is seen when chemical mixtures go through cycles of wetting and drying, as would occur along the margins of pools of hot water on volcanic sites. Such sites would have been a common environment on the early Earth. Wetting and drying promotes chemical reactions and also causes lipid membranes to form compartments that encapsulate different mixtures of compounds. According to Deamer, the first life emerged from the natural production of vast numbers of these membrane-bound "protocells."</p>
<p>"The first life was not just replicating molecules, it was an encapsulated system of molecules--a cell," he said.</p>
<p>The most recent findings from Deamer's lab, published in the January issue of the journal <em>Biochimie,</em> showed that wet-dry cycles in a system including membrane-forming lipids can drive the replication of a DNA molecule without any need for the polymerase enzyme that performs this function in living cells today.</p>
<p>"Some people are still skeptical--I think the new results have to soak in for awhile, and the experiment needs to be repeated by others. I've had this idea for the past 20 years that lipids could have an organizing effect that helps polymerization occur and then encapsulate the resulting polymers to produce simple cellular structures," Deamer said.</p>
<p>In addition to laboratory experiments, Deamer has conducted field experiments at volcanic sites in Russia, Hawaii, and California. "I think we need to be bolder in testing our ideas," he said. "There has to be sufficient complexity in our experiments to match the complex conditions of the origin of life. That's one reason I started doing experiments in real-world environments."</p>
<p>Deamer's long involvement in research on life's origins and his personal relationships with other leading scientists in the field has enabled him to give readers of the new book a "behind-the-scenes" look at this exciting scientific quest.</p>
<p>"In <em>First Life,</em> Deamer offers a delightful synthesis of research into life's dawn with his own vision for how it came to be," wrote science writer Carl Zimmer.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="511f39ff80727046012375a3ad713989"><name>market-cart</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Farm &amp; Garden market cart opens Tuesday, June 7</title><summary>“Opening day” is around the corner, with spring produce and flowers going on sale at the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden’s market cart beginning Tuesday, June 7.</summary><keywords>ucsc, uc santa cruz, farm, farm &amp; garden, CASFS, agroecology, sustainability, organic vegetables, flowers, farmers market, </keywords><start-date>1307001600000</start-date><display-name>Farm &amp; Garden market cart opens</display-name><path>/2011/06/market-cart</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/06/market-cart</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1307031058705</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1307031891511</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/06/images/farm-cart-325.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/06/images/farm-cart-325.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>farm-cart-325.jpg</name><display-name>farm-cart-325.jpg</display-name><file-size>201080</file-size><width>325</width><height>482</height></image><image-alt>Farm and Garden market cart</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Fresh organic produce and flowers grown at the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden are available for sale Tuesdays and Fridays.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>&#160;&#8220;Opening day&#8221; is around the corner, with spring produce and flowers going on sale at the <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Farm &amp; Garden&#8217;s</a> market cart beginning Tuesday, June 7.

<p>Not UC Santa Cruz, where summertime is conference season, and thousands of newcomers are out crossing bridges, exploring the woods, and taking classes. &#160;UCSC expects 70 residential conference groups, and 10,000 visitors, to flock here from June 19 to August 27.</p>
<p>This is a chance for visitors to immerse themselves in such fields of interest as mathematics, lacrosse, mandolin playing, ocean studies, cross country and food science. Faculty, academic departments, and professional associations will sponsor the academic programs, youth sports camps, and adult conferences.</p>
<p><strong>School of rock</strong></p>
<p>Soundwall Music, established in 1993, is among the many returning attractions. This summer music camp is a real-life School of Rock that shows budding guitarists, bassists, vocalists and drummers from age 12 to 17 how to play in a band, learn rock music stylings, and jam together. According to the promotional materials, &#8220;students play all styles &#8230; from Led Zeppelin to the Beatles to Tool.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Nutrition and science<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>WellBalance, a nutrition and weight management program, is one of the newer programs for pre-college youth. The UCSC Science Internship Program (SIP) is launching its first residential program this summer; in previous years, SIP ran a day program for students on campus. SIP draws an elite group of high achieving high-school science students. These students will study everything from the metallicity of red giant stars in Andromeda&#8217;s dwarf spheroidal satellites to a computer-simulated galaxy formation.</p>
<p><strong>Cheer camps</strong></p>
<p>Another new face is Varsity Spirit, which brings two cheer camps to UCSC:&#160; Universal Cheer and Universal Dance Camp, both taking place on the west side of campus.</p>
<p><strong>Professional conferences</strong></p>
<p>New adult/professional conferences this summer are:&#160; Redwood Symposium, which is co-sponsored by UCSC, UC Berkeley and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and concerns the management and conservation of coast redwoods; Food Pro Users, an annual user group conference sponsored by UCSC and designed for food-service staff members who use the Automated Food Management Systems software program; and the Hertz Foundation, a non-profit organization that awards fellowships to Ph.D. students.</p>
<p>Coordinated by UCSC&#8217;s Conference Services, these conferences gross over $4 million in 10 weeks of the summer quarter. &#160;The net revenue helps reduce housing costs to students during the academic year.&#160; Additionally, conference programs help UCSC reach out to pre-college youth and showcase the campus to a national and international audience.</p>
<p><strong>Agroecology shortcourse</strong></p>
<p>Between 35 and 40 people from around the world will be on campus in July for the 12th Annual International Agroecology Shortcourse at the Sustainable Living Center. The theme is the transformation of food systems to the agroecology model from field to table, using California food systems as a working case study of challenges and successes.</p>

<p>The week came to a close with the prestigious 2011 Undergraduate Academic Achievement, Excellence in Teaching, and Mentoring Awards ceremony and reception, which drew more than 300 well wishers to the Colleges Nine &amp; Ten Multipurpose Room on Friday.</p>
<p>One highlight was the Steck Family Award, which honors the best senior thesis completed during the academic year, with the winner chosen from the Chancellor's Award candidates.&#160;</p>
<p>This year's winner is Luke Kelley, 23, an astrophysics major whose thesis project, "The Distribution of Coalescing Compact Bianaries: Implications for Gravitational Wave Detections," was five years in the making. <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/12/gravity-waves.html">The project is a gravitational wave study</a>.</p>
<p>Kelley's thesis advisor, &#160;associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, praised Kelley's far-ranging intelligence and curiosity. Like the best scientists, "Luke can live with uncertainty," Ramirez-Ruiz said. "He doesn't feel frightened by not knowing. If you don't recognize this doubt, you cannot make new discoveries. Luke is creative because he looks at a problem from so many different angles."</p>
<p>While a number of undergraduates need a lot of direction and advising, "Luke is just the opposite," Ramirez-Ruiz said. "If you give him too much guidance and direction, he will feel lost. You have to let him thrive with open boundaries."</p>
<p>Kelley will receive bound copies of his prize-winning work and a $1,000 honorarium. (<a href="images/student-achievement-awardees_2010-11.pdf">See the complete list of student honorees</a>.<span>) Kelley also received a Dean's award as well as a Keith and Ann Thimann Scholarship for his project.</span></p>
<p><span>Even before the ceremony, Kelley has received a considerable amount of recognition for his work. His work with Ramirez-Ruiz received coverage in publications including&#160;Astronomy Now, Space Daily, OneIndia, and Asian News International.</span></p>
<p><span>Kelley has been admitted to&#160;Harvard University's graduate program in astrophysics.&#160;</span></p>
<p>Loren Steck (Porter '73), who sits on UCSC&#8217;s Board of Trustees, was on hand to congratulate Kelley. Steck was part of the distinguished selection commiteee that chose to recognize Kelley's thesis.&#160;</p>
<p>Excellence in teaching was also celebrated on Friday, as Chancellor Blumenthal honored the recipients of UCSC's <a href="teaching-excellence.xml">2010-11 Excellence in Teaching Awards</a>. The campus's outstanding Teaching Assistants have also been named by the Graduate Division; see the <a href="outstanding-teaching-assistants.xml">recipients on this year's TA awards</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>Student Achievement Week was also a chance for science and engineering majors to present their work in a public forum.</p>
<p>The Physical &amp; Biological Sciences Division rolled out 90 undergraduate presentations during the 14th Annual Undergraduate Research Poster Symposium, &#160;which recognizes and promotes the outstanding undergraduate research that is being carried out at UCSC while providing students with the experience of presenting their research results in a professional setting.</p>
<p>Over 150 students took part in the symposium, setting a record for the division at UCSC.</p>
<p>Paula Schneider, an administrative specialist for the Physical &amp; Biological Science division, described the student work as &#8220;important, meaningful, and groundbreaking. The sooner we get scientists into a research environment, the better it is for everyone in the long run.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been doing this event for a couple of years, and every year, the students astound me,&#8221; Schneider added.</p>
<p>The presentations were unusually far ranging and ambitious this year.</p>
<p>Computer engineering major Ariel Anders gave a presentation about &#8220;dental robotics&#8221; &#8211; the use of robotic methods for dental implants and crowns.</p>
<p>A team consisting of engineering students Brady Boone,Alejandro Cerda, Nolan Lau, Paul Naud, and Chasen Peters gave a presentation about a small, motorized "autonomous vehicle" that could intelligently deliver mail and small packages to pre-set locations.</p>
<p>Joshua Brown, who is studying ecology and evolution, gave a presentation about the mating success of non-alpha elephant seals, while engineering students James Herrera and Chris Hoseit described a radar system that would monitor the way sea birds interact with vertical-axis wind turbines.</p>
<p>The arts were also on full display this week on campus. <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/news_events/open-studios-spring-2011">The Art Department Open Studios</a>, which runs through Saturday, June 3, is run in conjunction with the Digital Arts and New Media (DANM) Open Studios. The exhibition features student&#160; drawing, painting, print media, sculpture, intermedia, photography and electronic art.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://artsites.ucsc.edu/printsale/">37th Annual UCSC Student Print Sale</a> at the Baskin Visual Arts Center, which started Friday, June 2, and continues Saturday, June 3, drew throngs of buyers and browsers on its first day. Crowds of people leaned over long tables, every square inch covered with etchings, handmade books, wood block and linoleum prints.</p>
<p>Subjects included ancient bristlecone pines, skulls, dancing bears, and maps of imaginary kingdoms. Eighty percent of the proceeds go to the student artists. The rest supports UCSC&#8217;s Print Studio.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/12/gravity-waves.html</url><title>Read more about Luke Kelley's gravitational wave study</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="573f7a7680727046012375a3c2b894b3"><name>teaching-excellence</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Five UCSC instructors honored for their teaching excellence</title><summary>Five instructors at UC Santa Cruz received the campus's Excellence in Teaching Award during the annual year-end ceremony on Friday honoring undergraduate student achievement.

Students nominate faculty and the Academic Senate Committee on Teaching selects awardees, based on input from deans, department chairs, and materials submitted by nominees.</p>
<p>One of the Teaching Awards is called the Ron Ruby Award and given to a professor in the Physical and Biological Sciences. The award was established in 2004-05 through a gift to the Physical and Biological Sciences Division from the family of founding UCSC Physics professor Ronald Ruby, an innovative and energetic professor.</p>
<p>Each of the five instructors received the award from Chancellor Blumenthal. They recipients are:</p>
<p><strong>Ben Leeds Carson, <em>Associate Professor of Music</em></strong></p>
<p>Ben Leeds Carson holds both a Masters and Ph.D. in Music. Prior to joining the faculty at UCSC in 2003, he taught at UC Riverside and UC San Diego and was a researcher and artist-in-residence at a music institute in Paris, France. He receives accolades for his teaching, research and performance. He received a prize for excellence in research at UC San Diego and won First Prize in the British and International Bass Festival.&#160;</p>
<p>He is well respected by both students and faculty colleagues. Everyone points to his enthusiasm, dedication and energy. Students say they leave his classes with a greater appreciation for music and good teaching. His classes include lectures and YouTube clips, as well as performances by him, fellow musicians, and students. Colleagues call him a &#8220;true intellectual&#8221; who fluidly blends scholarship and performance.</p>
<p>Of special note is his sensitivity to issues of diversity in education, including issues of gender, ethnic, and cultural studies. The chair of the Music Department mentioned that he singlehandedly revised their undergraduate curriculum to integrate diversity issues (ethnic and stylistic) into course offerings, challenging both faculty and students to broaden their scope.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Flora Lu, <em>Assistant Professor of Latin American &amp; Latino Studies</em></strong></p>
<p>Flora Lu has a Ph.D. in Ecology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where she taught in the Anthropology Department before coming to UCSC. Although she has only been teaching at UCSC for three years she has already made her mark with her colleagues, students, and the community. Since 2008, she received the Division of Social Sciences Golden Apple Distinguished Teaching Award (2010), a Division of Social Sciences research award (2009), and nearly $70,000 in grant funding from Academic Senate Committees and campus&#160;research institutes to further her work on protected ecologies and environmental justice issues.&#160;</p>
<p>She is a strong proponent of service learning. In her Environmental Justice course, students do hands-on research and collaborate with organizations, such as the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (UCSC), Greenaction for Health and Environmental Justice (San Francisco), and Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, to learn about environmental decision-making.&#160;</p>
<p>Colleagues remark that her syllabi are superlative: interesting, well organized, clear and academically rigorous. Students are effusive about her teaching as well, noting that she includes guest lectures and films that are provocative and intended to stimulate discussion. She encourages engagement in the course material as well as with other students, which results in classes that are thought-provoking and lively.</p>
<p><strong>Randa Roland, <em>Lecturer in Chemistry</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Ron Ruby Award for Teaching Excellence</em></p>
<p>Randa Roland is devoted not only to her students but also to the campus. She earned her Ph.D. in Chemistry at UCSC and, after short stints as a researcher at several companies and a lecturer at Cabrillo, she returned to UCSC. She has been teaching here since 2005. She currently teaches the General Chemistry three-course, large foundational series with up to 350 students per quarter. It is rare that faculty of very large classes connect individually with students, but she manages to do so repeatedly.&#160;</p>
<p>Students say that she truly cares about them and strives to make everyone in her class succeed. Students find her enthusiasm for the subject matter infectious and give her superb evaluations, stressing her fun and friendly teaching methods as well as her ability to explain difficult concepts in a variety of ways (and as many times as necessary) to ensure that all students achieve her rigorous learning objectives.&#160;</p>
<p>Roland is continuously exploring new ways of delivering the material and was first to introduce on-line homework in the chemistry series. (She color-coded it to help students learn and recall the material better.) She uses real-world examples and demonstrations, enabling her to make course material come alive.&#160;</p>
<p>This is not the first award Roland received at UCSC, nor even the first this year. She received awards from the Disability Resource Center this year and last for creating a welcoming environment and using instructional sstrategies that respond to a wide range of learning styles, including students with disabilities.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Robert Shepherd, <em>Lecturer in Economics</em></strong></p>
<p>Robert Shepherd received his Masters of Accounting from USC and shortly thereafter became the Chief of Accounting for the County of Santa Cruz, and then Director of Finance for the City of Santa Cruz. He joined UCSC as a lecturer 30 years ago. Lecturer Shepherd received the Excellence in Teaching Award in 2001, and has also been recognized by the Alumni Association with the Favorite Professor Award (1991-92) and by the Division of Social Sciences with the Golden Apple Distinguished Teaching Award (1991).</p>
<p>He receives high evaluations from students in all dimensions of teaching assessment: overall educational value, quality of instruction, command of the subject, organization, and others. Students comment on his enthusiasm and passion for accounting and teaching, impact on their confidence and career choice, and ability to make what some may consider a dry subject engaging and fun. He is extraordinarily dedicated to students, and was instrumental in the development of the accounting program and Business Management Economics major at UCSC. He serves on the department&#8217;s committee that evaluates undergraduates for honors in the major and is a regular volunteer for summer advising days.&#160;</p>
<p>His courses are rigorous and prepare students extremely well for success in the field, as evidenced by his students routinely scoring among the highest in the state on standardized CPA exams and receiving job offers or internships while taking his upper division courses. Under his leadership and initiative, UCSC has become one of the major sites for recruiting by the country&#8217;s major accounting firms. He created and organizes a &#8220;Meet the Firms&#8221; day that links over 200 students with representatives of the major firms in an afternoon of mini-interviews and information exchange.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Andrea Steiner, <em>Lecturer in Community Studies</em></strong></p>
<p>Andrea Steiner has an M.S. in Gerontology from USC and a Ph.D. in Health Policy Analysis from the RAND Graduate School of Policy Studies. She has extensive experience in research and has been a consultant and/or research associate at many locations, including the RAND Corporation in Southern California, and Research Institute for Care of the Elderly in Bath, England. She has been a lecturer at UCSC in the Community Studies Department since 2001 as well as the Biology and Economics Departments (since 2005 and 2006, respectively). Steiner&#8217;s mastery of new topics is impressive, and she confidently and successfully offers courses she has not taught previously.&#160;</p>
<p>In 2010, Steiner received an award from the Disabilities Resource Center, recognizing her exemplary efforts to create a welcoming campus climate for students with disabilities, especially those with learning, psychological, Autism spectrum, and other disabilities that are not always apparent.</p>
<p>Steiner is widely known for her mentoring; her office hours typically fill the hallway with students seeking her advice and help.

<br/>
 If you routinely park on campus with a valid UCSC parking&#160;permit, you should be able to park in the lot you&#160;normally use on Friday.&#160;<strong>Parking in the Core West structure, however,&#160;will be severely constrained by&#160;celebration parking shortly before noon.</strong>&#160;Be aware that&#160;the West Remote lot will be limited to A, B, or Commencement&#160;parking permits&#160;from 7:30am Friday through 10:00pm on Sunday. Display your permit as usual, and&#160;please&#160;don't park in spaces reserved for VIPs, "Special Pass"&#160;holders, or disabled visitors.<br/>

 If you have questions about parking in a particular parking&#160;lot, please contact Deborah Bryant at the TAPS&#160;Event Parking office (459-1097).<br/>

Please be aware that campus traffic will be very restricted on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, as attendants guide thousands of visitors to commencement parking. If you plan on parking on campus with an R permit during this time, please use the following lots: <br/>
<br/>
Friday:&#160; R permits will be valid in the East Remote or North Remote. They will not be valid in the West Remote lot Friday morning through Sunday night. <br/>
<br/>
Saturday and Sunday:&#160; R permits will be valid in the North Remote or Barn Theater. Loop shuttles will be running in both directions from the Main Entrance and Barn Theater to various commencement locations on campus. <br/>
<br/>
If you have visitors coming to campus on Friday, let them know that Metro buses that travel to UCSC will be fare-free that day. Also, on Friday only, permits will not be required in the East Remote. <br/>

For the slug&#8217;s earliest fans, rallying behind the mollusk was a mischievous gesture, a thumb in the eye of the status quo.</p>
<p>These days, 25 years after it became the campus's official mascot, the slug could not be more accepted and beloved. UCSC&#8217;s chancellor, George Blumenthal, walks around campus wearing a slug ballcap. His cell phone ringtone is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AlJtaFaJUU">UCSC banana slug fight song</a>, courtesy of the Austin Lounge Lizards.</p>
<p>Students vie for the chance to wear a newly redesigned Sammy the Slug costume at sports events and campus picnics. Tourists eat peanut butter-filled candy slugs at popular <a href="http://www.mackenzieschocolates.com/">Mackenzies Chocolates</a> in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Online, you can find slug pom poms, tall socks, pillows, plush toys, key chains, scarves, mugs, and face decorations. All of this slug paraphernalia can make people forget that this mascot&#8217;s future once hung on a slender thread of slime.</p>
<p><strong>A slimy history</strong></p>
<p>Soon after UCSC first opened its doors in 1965, the students started taking hikes through the redwoods. It didn&#8217;t take them long to notice the giant, banana-yellow organisms hanging around the ferns and the underbrush.</p>
<p>Native to western North America, these creatures are the second largest land slugs in the world. They descended from marine snails who tried their luck on land 400 million years ago.</p>
<p>Students knew what they were doing when they adopted the slug. If other colleges used fierce mammals to hype their footballs teams, then UCSC, which had no football team, would take up the cause of a slow-moving, slimy creature that had no spine or shell and could mate for eight hours at a time.</p>
<p>"The slug just suited the campus so well--its symbiotic relationship with the redwoods and its nonviolent Gandhi-an characteristics," said Marc Ratner (Cowell '87, linguistics).</p>
<p>Ratner would later give the slug a popularity boost by designing the "Fiat Slug" logo--showing a cartoon slug wearing glasses while reading Plato. ("Fiat Slug" means "Let there be Slug" in Latin.) But without a series of events that began in 1980, it's possible the slug would have merely enjoyed a long life as an underground mascot at UCSC.</p>
<p><strong>Turning point</strong></p>
<p>That was the year Chancellor Robert Sinsheimer brought the campus into the National Collegiate Athletic Association as a Division III school for the first time. Until then, UCSC had unofficial sports &#8220;clubs&#8221; but no NCAA teams.</p>
<p>Sinsheimer felt that Division III status was a good compromise; it enabled UCSC to compete while holding on to its &#8220;traditional low-key approach to athletics.&#8221;</p>
<p>NCAA Division III-affiliated colleges did not offer full sports scholarships to student athletes. However, they were expected to have an official mascot, and UCSC was no exception. In 1981, a group of student athletes pushed for the sea lion; Sinsheimer supported their choice.</p>
<p>The matter seemed settled, but the slug cause would not die. Students kept showing up to basketball games, and yelling "Slime 'em!" and "Go slugs!"</p>
<p>In 1986, the newly formed Student Union Assembly voted to put the mascot issue on a campuswide ballot measure.</p>
<p>Eric Satzman (Cowell '87, sociology), the SUA president at that time, recalls that it was a non-binding resolution. The administration, not the students, had the final say about the mascot issue. Still, Satzman was confident the slug would prevail and at least the students' preference would be made clear.</p>
<p>"The slug represented the hearts and minds of the students and the way they perceived UCSC as a unique institution," he said. Satzman added that he had nothing against the &#8220;poor little sea lion."</p>
<p>In conjunction with the SUA measure, a number of students rallied for the cause. Satzman, along with fellow students John Sulmeyer (Cowell '87, history) and Jon Spivak (Cowell '87, language studies), formed a rock group, Bobby and the Slugtones, which released <a href="http://mediafiles.ucsc.edu/news/audio/theslugsareback.mp3" title="MP3 of ">a single called &#8220;the Slugs Are Back.&#8221;</a> The "Bobby" part of their name was a winking reference to Chancellor Sinsheimer.</p>
<p>"We recorded it in my room," said Sulmeyer, who sang lead vocals. "I tweaked my voice electronically because I was trying to sound like a slug. Obviously, it was complete silliness."</p>
<p>But the song resonated. A major radio station in San Francisco played it. "It definitely added to the (slug) hysteria," Sulmeyer said. "Eric was getting calls from National Public Radio."</p>
<p>The song's popularity, and the national publicity surrounding the slug-versus-sea lion debate, galvanized the campus. Radio stations across the country weighed in. So did national newspapers and magazines from <em>People</em> to <em>Audubon</em>. &#160;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at UCSC, the slug continued to grow in popularity. Alumni sent letters supporting the slug. The results of the student vote were clear: A five-to-one majority favored the banana slug.</p>
<p><strong>Administrative hesitance</strong></p>
<p>Initially, Sinsheimer expressed his reluctance to embrace the student choice for mascot.</p>
<p>Though he is a distinguished scientist known for his breakthroughs in genetic research, Sinsheimer received a very different kind of publicity when he wrote, in a witty and spirited statement to a campus newspaper, that the sea lion had plenty of "spirit and vigor," while dismissing the slug as "spineless (ipso facto), yellow (cowardly), sluggish (slow of foot [?]), and slimy (enough said)."</p>
<p>Later, after Sinsheimer bowed to the vote, and the slug became the official face of UCSC, he made it clear he had no personal animus toward the moist, yellowy mascot.</p>
<p>On the invitations to his retirement reception in June 1987, he included a logo that must have taken some of his colleagues by surprise. It showed a cartoon banana slug and sea lion embracing each other with smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;The students have the greatest interest in the mascot, so I agreed to accept their choice, which was overwhelmingly the banana slug,&#8221; he said in a recent interview. &#8220;I am fine with that. It is amusing, and the artists have drafted it into a rather fetching icon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The slug mascot may very well be the most recognizable image associated with UC Santa Cruz. John Travolta helped the banana slug cause immeasurably in 1994 when he wore a UCSC T-shirt, with Ratner's Fiat Slug logo, in Quentin Tarantino's hit movie&#160;<em>Pulp Fiction</em>.</p>
<p>These days, members of UCSC sports identify as slugs.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t stop there. Even undergraduates who don&#8217;t play sports, and alumni who live far away from UCSC, identify with the slimy yellow mollusks.</p>
<p>&#8220;To this day,&#8221; said Marc Ratner, &#8220;I think of myself as a slug.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2008/02/1955.html</url><title>Who is Sammy Slug?

<p>Joined by the President's science advisor, John P. Holdren, President Obama greeted Nelson, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics, and the other Kavli Prize Laureates: Roger Angel (University of Arizona), Donald M. Eigler (IBM Almaden Research Center), James E. Rothman (Yale University), Richard H. Scheller (Genentech), Nadrian C. Seeman (New York University), and Thomas C. S&#252;dhof (Stanford University). Accompanying the laureates were Fred Kavli, founder and chairman of the Kavli Foundation; Robert W. Conn, President of the Kavli Foundation; and Wegger Chr. Strommen, the Norwegian ambassador to the United States.</p>
<p>The Kavli Prizes are a partnership between the Kavli Foundation (U.S.), the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, and the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research.</p>
<p>"We are extremely grateful to the President for the honor of this visit, and for his strong and heartfelt commitment to scientific research and discovery," said Fred Kavli. "It reflects the nation's deep support for innovative research that scientists across the country rely upon, including the foundational research discoveries of the 2010 Kavli Laureates."</p>
<p>The Kavli Laureates received their awards for research that made it possible to look more deeply and clearly into the universe, to control matter on the nano scale, and to understand how the brain's nerve cells communicate.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/kavli-ceremony.html">2010 Kavli Prize in Astrophysics</a> was awarded to Nelson, Angel, and Raymond N. Wilson of the European Southern Observatory in Germany for their contributions to the development of giant telescopes. The size of a telescope's primary mirror determines the light-gathering power and ability to detect and resolve the faintest and most distant objects in the universe. Nelson, Wilson, and Angel pioneered the development of a new generation of large optical telescopes with innovations such as precise reflecting mirrors and more sophisticated shaping that has led to an extraordinary range of fundamental discoveries about the cosmos.</p>

<p>Blumenthal, who earned a B.S. in physics from UWM in 1966, was the keynote speaker during UWM's morning commencement ceremony on Sunday, May 22, 2011.</p>
<p>Blumenthal thanked UWM Chancellor Michael Lovell and campus officials, saying he was "deeply honored" to receive the degree. Then, turning to thousands of graduates gathered from inside the 12,700-seat U.S. Cellular Arena, he quipped, "Even though I didn't work nearly as hard for this degree as all of you did for the diplomas you'll receive today!"</p>
<p>Due to the number of graduates, UWM hosted two commencement ceremonies. Blumenthal addressed bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. candidates in the College of Letters and Science, the School of Architecture and Urban Planning, the School of Information Studies, and the Peck School of the Arts.</p>
<p>Blumenthal's remarks focused on the value of a U.S.-style college education, which prepares "well-rounded" graduates, unlike many universities in Europe and Asia that focus on vocational preparation.</p>
<p>"Whatever your next step is&#8230; you have already taken the most important step toward a great future," he told the crowd.</p>
<p>He urged graduates to be confident and to focus on what they've accomplished, rather than worry about the unknown as they begin this new chapter in their lives.</p>
<p>"The tricky thing about self-confidence is that it matters so much&#8212;but it's not always there when you need it the most," he said.</p>
<p>Blumenthal reassured those in the audience who might not know what their next step is, saying, "If someone had told me when I was sitting in your seat that I'd end up the chancellor of a university, I would've said they were nuts!"</p>
<p>He recounted his own post-college doubts as he headed to graduate school at UC San Diego.</p>
<p>"I didn't come from a long line of academics," he said, noting that he and his sister were the first in their family to earn college degrees. When he arrived at UCSD, he was "petrified."</p>
<p>"I was surrounded by students from the top private universities in the country," he recalled. "I wondered if I was as well-prepared as I needed to be to compete with them."</p>
<p>He swiftly realized that the education he got at UWM was "every bit as good as what students got at Harvard, Princeton, and MIT."</p>
<p>Blumenthal made a pitch for public research universities, urging graduates to lobby legislators on behalf of their alma mater and to "give back" to UWM by making a donation before they depart.</p>
<p>Then he offered three pieces of advice, each "somewhat paradoxical."</p>
<p>First, he urged graduates to be confident and stay humble. "There's a lot left to learn," he reminded them.</p>
<p>Second, he encouraged graduates to be "focused and persistent about pursuing your goals, and yet remain open to unexpected opportunities." The best careers, he said, are built with a combination of focus and serendipity.</p>
<p>And finally, he concluded with a reminder to "work hard on whatever lies ahead, but also take time out to think the big thoughts." It is important to reflect on what you're learning, what you're seeing, and the impacts you're having on the world, he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6b03d2c680727046012375a3aaf509be"><name>folklorico</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Grupo Folklórico Los Mejicas honored at 39th annual performance</title><summary>Grupo Folklórico Los Mejicas was presented with two awards of recognition during the troupe's 39th annual spring concert including Watsonville Mayor Daniel Dodge proclaiming June 3 "Grupo Folklórico Los Mejicas Day" in Watsonville. </summary><keywords>uc, ucsc. uc santa cruz, social sciences, olga najéra-ramírez, grupo folklórico los mejicas, mexican dance, folklórico, student dance group</keywords><start-date>1307433600000</start-date><display-name>Grupo Folklórico Los Mejicas</display-name><path>/2011/06/folklorico</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/06/folklorico</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1307465470461</created-on><last-modified-by>jrburns</last-modified-by><last-modified>1308694112843</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Anthropology</value><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/06/images/folklorico-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/06/images/folklorico-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>folklorico-350.jpg</name><display-name>folklorico-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>147306</file-size><width>350</width><height>277</height></image><image-alt>UCSC folklórico group receives honor from Watsonville's mayor</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/06/images/folklorico-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/06/images/folklorico-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>folklorico-80.jpg</name><display-name>folklorico-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>32295</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>UCSC Anthropology Professor Olga Najéra-Ramírez</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Watsonville Mayor Daniel Dodge congratulates, from left, student co-leaders Lorena Lopez and Mariela Melendez, and anthropology professor Olga Naj&#233;ra-Ram&#237;rez, after proclaiming June 3 "Grupo Folkl&#243;rico Los Mejicas Day" in Watsonville.

Watsonville Mayor Daniel Dodge proclaimed Friday "Grupo Folkl&#243;rico Los Mejicas Day" in Watsonville in honor of the group for "preserving the beauty of our Mexicano/Latino heritage and cultura through dance, and for providing&#160; a safe place that creates a community of peers bound together by the love of dance and cultura."&#160;</p>
<p>The next evening, Daniel Dodge, Jr., representing Assembly member Bill Monning, awarded the group with a certificate of recognition from the state Assembly.<br/>
<br/>
This year&#8217;s show, &#8220;El Orgullo de mi Tierra,&#8221; or &#8220;the pride of my country,&#8221; was the culmination of a year of training and rehearsal for the student-run group and marked its 39th anniversary. The dance performances showcased traditional folkloric dances from six regions of Mexico: Nayarit Costa, Durango, Puebla, Colima, Tabasco, and Veracruz. Invited guests, <em>Raices de Santa Cruz</em>, a folkl&#243;rico group based in Beach Flats performed dances from Oaxaca.<br/>
<br/>
Anthropology Professor Olga Naj&#233;ra-Ram&#237;rez, who danced with the group as a UCSC student and continues today as faculty advisor for Los Mejicas, accepted the awards along with Mejicas co-directors Lorena Lopez and Mariela Melendez. She described the performances as "amazing."&#160; Grupo Folkl&#243;rico Los Mejicas was founded in 1972 and is open to students of all cultural and ethnic backgrounds.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6c2b343780727046012375a399ddf977"><name>ucsc-in-the-news-6-06-11</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>Sociology department chair Craig Reinarman's research was cited in War on Drugs: The Report of the Global Commission on Drug Policy.

Once she saw a new-looking Xbox set.</p>
<p>But Li (Porter, molecular biology) says the situation is improving as UC Santa Cruz continues to work towards zero landfill waste.</p>
<p>As part of that campaign, UCSC, for the past few years, has been holding &#8220;Zero-Waste Move Out&#8221; events across the campus, making it easy for students to deposit household goods, electronics and other materials in collection bins.</p>
<p>"It&#8217;s getting better, definitely," said Li, who volunteered to help with this year&#8217;s eco-friendly move-out.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the nonprofit organization Ecology Action, UCSC has been diverting more than 60 percent of its waste from landfills. For the eco-friendly move-out, the campus partners with agencies that can use, sell or redistribute the house wares, toiletry items and electronics, giving them new life while keeping them out of the landfill. Those organizations include H.O.P.E. Services, Goodwill, Second Harvest Food Bank, and Homeless Services of Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve done this for four years, and it keeps getting better,&#8221; said Chris Attias, director of facilities for UCSC&#8217;s Student Affairs, Housing and Dining. &#8220;It&#8217;s much more organized now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campus, in conjunction with a UC system-wide goal, is hoping to produce zero landfill waste by 2020.&#160; The university is taking this deadline seriously; last year, one participating nonprofit collected an estimated 10,000 pounds of materials during move-out.</p>
<p>Fewer students are leaving items in their room because volunteers have placed 33 recycling stations throughout the campus. Another incentive is the bills that students may receive if they abandon items in their dorms.</p>
<p>Hannah Hodgson of Ecology Action visited the campus to help with the move-out. Ecology Action recently received a two-year Multifamily Recycling Program grant that is bringing door-to-door recycling education to UC Santa Cruz, CSU Monterey Bay, and 270 multifamily housing complexes throughout Santa Cruz, San Benito and Monterey counties.</p>
<p>Hodgson greeted students as they walked past. &#8220;Are you moving out soon?&#8221; she asked one of them. &#8220;Do you know you can recycle and donate?&#8221;</p>
<p>Silas Snyder, UCSC's safety, training and conservation coordinator for housing services, said the &#8220;Zero-Waste&#8221; program also makes the move-out safer for workers responsible for clearing out materials left in dorm rooms. Fewer materials means less heavy lifting.</p>
<p>More than 6,000 students are clearing out of campus this week.</p>
<p>Even before the big move-out rush leading up to graduation, students were filling up bins with everything from unopened bottles of hand sanitizer to shrink-wrapped containers of coconut-scented body lotion. One bin contained a lamp, a comforter, and <em>The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants Part II</em> DVD.</p>
<p>The agencies that pick up these materials will decide if they can be resold or not.</p>

A resident of Brookdale in the Santa Cruz Mountains, Mr. Malloch was president of the foundation from 1997 to 1999; in 2002, he was elected an emeritus trustee.</p>
<p>In a 1999 interview in UCSC's Review Magazine, Malloch &#8212; who was born in Santa Cruz &#8212; recalled spending many a day during his childhood exploring the rock quarries, meadows, and caves on the property that would one day become a University of California campus. "There isn't a time that I visit UCSC now that I don't think of my years as a youngster playing around on the old Cowell Ranch," Malloch said.</p>
<p>In the same interview, he also marveled at what had become of his childhood playground. "UCSC makes a tremendous academic and cultural contribution to the community, and many of its students have gone on to do great things."</p>
<p>Malloch, who was a successful San Francisco attorney, worked behind the scenes to support some of UCSC's most visible programs. He personally steered millions of dollars from other benefactors to UCSC's Arboretum, Farm &amp; Garden, Library, and to the Marine Discovery Center at the Long Marine Laboratory. He was also a generous contributor to campus research on elephant seals.</p>

research was the diverse backgrounds of immigrants</article-subhead><article-text><p>Patricia Zavella was in for a surprise when she compiled data from a survey of Mexican immigrants in Santa Cruz and Watsonville.&#160; The UC Santa Cruz professor of Latin American and Latino Studies (LALS) was well into her ethnographic research on how immigration influences experiences of family, work, and identity among Mexican Americans and migrants.<br/>
<br/>
Scores of interviews were already complete and she and others in the field had long heard of "chain migration" to the central coast from the Mexican states of Michoac&#225;n and Jalisco.&#160; People in one village in Jalisco told her there were more residents from the village living in Watsonville than in the village itself.<br/>
<br/>
But survey data told a different story as she writes in <em>I'm Neither Here nor There, Mexicans' Quotidian Struggles with Migration and Poverty</em> (Duke University Press, 2011). Zavella describes in her new book how poor and working class Mexican Americans and migrants struggle for agency and identity in Santa Cruz County.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
"One of the surprises was finding how diverse people were," she said. Zavella, the outgoing chair of LALS, had shared an assumption that immigrant populations in this region hailed from a relatively narrow area.&#160; But the surveys taken at local health fairs in 2006, showed respondents were from 19 states in Mexico (out of 31 states and one federal district.)<br/>
<br/>
"It was an incredible surprise," she said of all the places people were from. What she found common, however, was ambivalent feelings of identity by migrants and by Mexican Americans.<br/>
<br/>
Zavella's book is based on research from 1993 to 2006. She conducted life histories of 76 people to document their experiences related to migration and poverty.&#160; One phenomenon she describes is residents' "peripheral vision," that "signals ways in which people always have Mexico in the back of their minds"<br/>
<br/>
Even citizens of Mexican background raised in the United States have peripheral vision, Zavella found. "'Should I go back? Should I raise my children to be good Mexicans here?'" The new residents struggled with who they were and who they should be.<br/>
<br/>
"Others assume they are immigrants or treat them as immigrants," she said,&#160; "so for them, they think of their Mexican heritage and what their relationship is to Mexico."<br/>
<br/>
The interviews were difficult, she recalls, particularly in the beginning as people struggled with feelings of how they were treated by U.S. society.&#160; There was "such anti-immigrant fervor," she said of the era when California's Proposition 187 touted as the "Save our State initiative" sought to cut education and benefits to illegal immigrants. "I had to take a break, I thought, 'I can't bear to make someone cry again.'"<br/>
<br/>
Zavella said that despite a recent increase in anti-immigrant feelings, she's seen many changes since her research began 18 years ago. "People are moving away from feeling demoralized," she said. There has been a shift to where "people begin to say, &#8216;I'm undocumented and so what, I'm here to work.&#8217;" She analyzes how this political shift can be seen in the performance of music as sites where musicians, cultural activists and audiences construct cultural memory and community.<br/>
<br/>
She also sees more organizing and support on behalf of the undocumented residents.<br/>
"There is a pan-racial, pan-ethnic solidarity out there that is untapped and can be mobilized."<br/>
<br/>
Zavella is hopeful the Obama administration will show some movement toward immigration reform.<br/>
<br/>
Proceeds from book sales will be used to fund an endowment in LALS for grants for books for students.<br/>

(Photographs by Guy Lasnier)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In her <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/06/jackson-address.html">College 10 commencement address</a> June 12, Lisa P. Jackson, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said there are plenty of good reasons for her to be on the UC Santa Cruz campus.<br/>
<br/>
"Your school's work on behalf of the environment is nationally recognized," she said, citing UCSC's top 10 ranking on national polls of eco-friendly colleges. "You are doing your part to make our communities cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable."<br/>
<br/>
Jackson spoke of her commitment to environmental justice and lauded College 10's focus on social justice. "You've learned here that part of social justice involves environmental justice&#8212;making sure that all Americans receive the same protections that ensure clean water and air and healthy communities."<br/>
<br/>
Earlier at a luncheon with Chancellor Blumenthal, environmental studies faculty, and local political luminaries, Jackson spoke of the important connection between health and the environment.&#160; The nation will save $2 trillion between 1990 and 2020 that otherwise would have been spent on health care costs if not for the Clean Air Act passed in 1970, she said.<br/>
<br/>
She praised the UCSC campus for taking a "love of a place and turning it into policy and practice." Jackson's visit to UC Santa Cruz was her first, though she'd been to Monterey. "It's hard to get here," she quipped, "but I wouldn't miss it. It's an honor to be here."<br/>
<br/>
Jackson, who earned a masters degree in chemical engineering from Princeton, was a 16-year employee of the EPA before she joined the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, rising to head the department. In 2009, President Obama appointed her as the first African American woman to head the EPA.<br/>
<br/>
She told graduating seniors that she became "a full-fledged" environmentalist after the Love Canal disaster discovered in the late 1970s when buried toxic sludge began oozing into basements in Niagra Falls.<br/>
<br/>
"I remember the day its greatest lesson hit me," she said, "if engineers can invent the processes that create all this waste, engineers would have to invent the processes to fix it."<br/>
<br/>
She spoke of her career path and doubts along the way, of her father's influence as a mail carrier in New Orleans and his commitment to the people on his route. She also spoke of growing up in New Orleans' Ninth Ward and how her mother's home was destroyed beneath eight feet of floodwater after Hurricane Katrina.<br/>
<br/>
Jackson said one of her first trips as EPA administrator was back to New Orleans to monitor the city's recovery.<br/>
<br/>
Jackson, the mother of two teenaged sons about to enter college, told the new graduates some may say to them: "Social justice? What will you do with that?<br/>
<br/>
"I am telling you to learn to trust your passions and decisions as you take your place in this new world of adulthood and self-responsibility."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/06/jackson-address.html</url><title>Text of Lisa Jackson's commencement address</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="89ccc34c80727046012375a344a08786"><name>jackson-address</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1307952000000</start-date><display-name>Lisa P.

Jackson</strong><br/>
<strong>UC Santa Cruz College 10 Commencement</strong><br/>
<strong>June 12, 2011</strong><br/>
<strong>As prepared for delivery</strong><br/>
<br/>
Congratulations class of 2011! It&#8217;s wonderful to be here with you today. And it&#8217;s my great privilege to welcome you into the world as college graduates.<br/>
<br/>
I&#8217;d like to thank some of those here with us: Chancellor Blumenthal and Vice Chancellor McGinty, Dean Kamieniecki, Provost Shapiro, Deana Slater. Thank you for welcoming me to your school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#8217;d also like to acknowledge those whose love and support have helped to lift our graduates to this moment.&#160; Please join me in thanking your families, teachers, mentors and friends.<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of good reasons for the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to be on this great campus.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Your school&#8217;s work on behalf of the environment is nationally recognized: you are one of US News and World Report's top 10 eco-friendly colleges, one of 18 colleges on the Princeton Review's Green Honor Roll, and fourth on the Sierra Club&#8217;s annual ranking of America's Greenest Schools. You are doing your part to make our communities cleaner, healthier and more sustainable.<br/>
<br/>
At College Ten, you&#8217;ve made it your specific mission to focus on social justice. And you&#8217;ve learned here that part of social justice involves environmental justice &#8211; making sure that all Americans receive the same protections that ensure clean water and air and healthy communities.<br/>
<br/>
Fighting for environmental justice is one of my key priorities at EPA, so thank you for your contribution.<br/>
<br/>
But today, I&#8217;m not here solely as the Administrator of the EPA.&#160; I&#8217;m also here as a mother of two teenage sons about to enter into their own college years. I&#8217;m here as someone who grew up in New Orleans&#8217; 9th ward.&#160; I&#8217;m here as one who worked hard through college &#8211; like you.&#160; And I&#8217;m here as someone who has seen firsthand life&#8217;s rewards and challenges&#8230;something I&#8217;ll talk more about in a moment.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#8217;d like to begin with a couple observations&#8230;lessons I bring to you from &#8220;the real world&#8221; &#8211; that place you are about to enter.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
One of those observations involves a single word:&#160; &#8220;passion.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Passion isn&#8217;t shaped by the guy or gal of the moment, but by the experiences that come together to form your life.<br/>
<br/>
The road to developing my passions started with my Dad, who worked as a post man. But to my Dad, his work meant more than a paycheck. He knew the people on his route, and would ring the bell when Social Security checks came in the mail to make sure they were received. He was dedicated and proud.<br/>
<br/>
My Dad set an example for me.&#160; I used to tell him that I wanted to work at the Post Office so I could be at the front lines serving my community like him.<br/>
<br/>
My parents encouraged me otherwise. But I knew from watching my father that I wanted to help people. So my parents pushed me to be a doctor and I went to college as a pre-med student.<br/>
<br/>
In college, along with my pre-med classes, I took a few engineering classes &#8211; and I liked them. I liked the inventive aspect of engineering.<br/>
<br/>
Then came a major chapter in American history &#8211; and in my life&#8230;one that goes by the ironic name Love Canal. Many of you have probably never heard of it all these years later, but Love Canal was the first major episode in which hazardous waste &#8211; the byproduct of our industrial age &#8211; had contaminated land and water in such a dramatic, tragic way.&#160; Toxic waste started invading homes and oozing into basements in Buffalo, New York.<br/>
<br/>
I remember this terrible incident like it was yesterday. And I remember the day its greatest lesson hit me:&#160; if engineers can invent the processes that create all this waste, engineers would invent the processes to fix it.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#8217;t have to be a doctor to practice preventative medicine. Protecting against pollution was protecting public health. From then on I was a full-fledged environmentalist. I had found a way to heal &#8211; the medical passion in me&#8230; to design and develop solutions &#8211; the engineer in me&#8230;and to help my community &#8211; the public servant in me.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
All these experiences &#8211; from watching my Dad at work to experiencing Love Canal &#8211; helped me realize my passions.<br/>
<br/>
For you, an event like September 11th might have been your &#8220;Love Canal&#8221; moment &#8211; it might have led you to your passion and to choose this college.<br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to a second observation: trust your decisions.&#160; Decisions are informed by your passions.<br/>
<br/>
It&#8217;s hard to know right after you&#8217;ve made a decision if it was a good or bad one. But what you do know is that the decision is yours. To be happy and confident, you need to do more than just live with your decision. You need to own and trust it. And those are two very different things.<br/>
<br/>
I lived with my decision to go into environmentalism for many years. And I was happy.&#160; My career was going well.&#160; I had helped to clean up hazardous waste in communities and formed plans to protect watersheds. I had started working on energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction.<br/>
<br/>
But then an event occurred that caused me to question the very decision I had lived with for so long. Remember &#8211; I grew up in New Orleans&#8217; 9th ward.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit, the levees broke and 8 feet of water covered my mom's home &#8211; the house where I grew up. I went to New Orleans in the days before the storm and drove my mother out.&#160; But our home was ruined.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
In the weeks following the hurricane, I was filled with regret. I dreamed of being able to build my mom a new home. One that was energy efficient and raised out of the floodplain.<br/>
<br/>
But I couldn't afford to act on this dream. For the first time, I really began to regret my career choices. I almost left government to move back to New Orleans, get a better-paying job, help clean up the pollution and rebuild my mom's home.<br/>
<br/>
But my mom encouraged me to stay and continue working in government. Soon after, the then-Governor of New Jersey asked me to stay with the state government. He promoted me to his Cabinet.&#160; And not long after that, President Obama asked me to stay with the federal government &#8211; and he promoted me to his Cabinet.<br/>
<br/>
One of my first trips as EPA Administrator was back to my hometown. And I&#8217;ve returned many times since then. I&#8217;ve seen that at long last my mom&#8217;s house is being rebuilt &#8211; rebuilt out of the floodplain and with energy-efficient technology&#8230;technology EPA thought up and is improving every day.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, when the Gulf was hit by yet another tragic challenge &#8211; the BP oil spill &#8211; I was in a position to help the people there. Given my very personal connection, President Obama named me to lead our efforts to restore the region after the spill and decades of abuse.<br/>
<br/>
So it turns out, even though I had some tough moments of doubt, my decisions were just right.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Now there are people around you today who may be saying: &#8220;Social justice? What will you do with that?&#8221; They may be trying to help you make the next big decision in your life &#8211; perhaps telling you to follow the money.&#160;&#160;&#160;<br/>
<br/>
I&#8217;m not telling you to ignore your parents or teachers or mentors. These people are filled with wisdom and love. They&#8217;ve lived through this time in their own lives and have the benefit of looking back &#8211; just as I have that benefit.<br/>
<br/>
But I am telling you to learn to trust your passions and decisions as you take your place in this new world of adulthood and self-responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
When I was graduating, Pink Floyd was the Jay-Z of the time.<br/>
<br/>
One song of theirs seems appropriate for this time in your life. It goes something like this&#8230;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Breathe, breathe in the air. Don&#8217;t be afraid to care&#8230;Leave, don&#8217;t leave me &#8230;Look around and choose your own ground.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
As you move onto your next adventure, don&#8217;t leave behind the experiences that made you who you are. Use them to &#8220;choose your own ground.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
So go forth. And as you go...<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Long you live and high you fly&#8230;smiles you&#8217;ll give and tears you&#8217;ll cry&#8230;all you touch and all you see&#8230;is all your life will ever be.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Remember, life is what you make of it. It&#8217;s filled with good and bad decisions. But they are yours.<br/>
<br/>
Trust yourself. And take advantage of opportunities as they come &#8211;opportunities this day presents to you.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;For long you live and high you fly&#8230;but only if you ride the tide.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you and all the best!<br/>
<br/>

<p>The prize, which consists of a medal and prize lecture to be given at Oxford, is awarded for contributions to the development of mathematical or statistical methods applied to problems in biology. This is the centennial year of the prize, established in 1911 and named in honor of Walter Frank Raphael Weldon, former Linacre Professor of Zoology at Oxford. Previous recipients include pioneering scientists such as R. A. Fisher, J. B. S. Haldane, and Sewall Wright, whose work on population genetics led to the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory.</p>
<p>"This prize was given to many of my heroes, so I'm very honored and will have a hard time living up to this," said Haussler, who directs the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>A Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, Haussler is a leader in the field of bioinformatics, which brings the power of advanced computational techniques to bear on complex problems in biology. His group is involved in several international collaborations aimed at developing our knowledge and understanding of the human genome as a foundation for biomedical advances. Haussler's team is involved in data analysis for <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2009/10/3250.html">The Cancer Genome Atlas</a> (TCGA), led by the National Cancer Institute and the National Human Genome Research Institute, and has developed a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2009/03/2802.html">Cancer Genomics Browser</a> designed to help researchers find patterns in large sets of clinical and genomic data from cancer studies.</p>
<p>Haussler is also using comparative genomics to investigate the evolutionary history of vertebrate animals. He is a founder of the <a href="http://genome10k.soe.ucsc.edu/">Genome 10K project</a>, which aims to assemble the genome sequences of 10,000 vertebrate species in order to understand how complex animal life evolved through changes in DNA.</p>
<p>Findings from the Haussler laboratory include the existence of <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2004/05/499.html">"ultraconserved" elements</a> in the human genome that have remained essentially unchanged across millions of years of evolution, suggesting important function. Haussler is credited with pioneering the use of several important methods for analyzing DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. He was the first to apply these methods to the genome-wide search for gene expression biomarkers in cancer, now a major effort of his laboratory. Haussler was also the first to demonstrate experimentally that retrotransposons (genetic elements distantly related to retroviruses) have been co-opted into vertebrate genomes over the last several hundred million years to act as distant regulatory elements that enhance gene expression, adding weight to the theory that these elements played a major role in molecular evolution.</p>
<p>Haussler has received many awards and honors for his work, including the 2009 Curt Stern Award from the American Society of Human Genetics, the 2006 Dickson Prize for Science from Carnegie Mellon University, and election to the National Academy of Sciences and American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1986.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="95e0ad7380727046012375a3e2b4d28c"><name>film-symposium-followup</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Film &amp;

<br/>
That was the takeaway message from the keynote address by UCSC alumnus&#8212;and president of Lionsgate Television&#8212;Kevin Beggs at the June 3-4 Film Symposium presented by the Arts Division.<br/>
<br/>
Beggs noted that the knowledge he gained as an undergraduate has served him well in ways that he could never have imagined, and it has been useful in almost every aspect of his &#8220;professional education&#8221; in television.<br/>
<br/>
Describing UC Santa Cruz as a &#8220;top-notch school for aspiring media students,&#8221; Beggs said that a healthy skepticism&#8212;&#8220;the same critical mindset that we develop here at UC Santa Cruz&#8221;&#8212;is instrumental to finding your way through Hollywood.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;A UCSC education discourages surface analysis and encourages a healthy distrust of the system, of agenda, of spin,&#8221; said Beggs.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Hollywood is built on spin, so it behooves one to know it when it walks in the room,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I listen to agents and managers try to advance their projects or convince me to develop something that I&#8217;m not sure is working, I must discern the truth from the artifice. The lessons learned here help me do it.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Beggs also stressed the importance of the relationships he was able to establish as an undergraduate at UCSC, leading to graduation and college honors in 1989 with a double major in politics and theater arts.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Mentorship matters,&#8221; said Beggs. &#8220;Small class size has always been one of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s advantages&#8230;it&#8217;s why I chose Santa Cruz instead of Berkeley because I thought I would not get lost in the crowd.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Professors in the Theater Arts Department&#8212;Paul Whitworth, Michael Edwards, Danny Scheie, Audrey Stanley, Mary-Kay Gamel&#8212;were incredible,&#8221; he added. &#8220;They left lifelong impressions on me that I brought into the workplace, and that I took with me into television.<br/>
<br/>
Nearly 200 people attended the two day symposium that included film screenings and lively panels featuring numerous alumni guests in the industry&#8212;many of them returning to UCSC for the first time in years.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;What the symposium demonstrated was the enduring and continuing strength of all the faculty in the Arts Division, as well as the intellectual and financial impact UC Santa Cruz arts alumni have had on the film and entertainment industry,&#8221; said arts dean David Yager.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;We are extremely proud of this legacy and are excited to expand upon it in the future,&#8221; he added.<br/>

Work will include demolition of the existing road, pavement grinding, excavation, grading, installation of a full roadway overlay, pedestrian access improvements, and road striping. The project's estimated completion date is September 1st.<br/>
<br/>
Two-way traffic control will be in place during the duration of the project. Drivers and transit riders should expect up to three-five minute delays in both directions while construction is underway. The main campus entrance is recommended as an alternate route to avoid construction-related delays. Additionally, the necessary use of large construction equipment will occasionally create noisy conditions near the project corridor.<br/>
<br/>
Bicycle traffic will be rerouted at both ends of the project corridor to an alternate route along Steinhart Drive, the Kerr Hall service road, and along Meyer Drive through the Performing Arts complex. Bicycle detour signage will be posted to assist in way-finding. Pedestrian access and crossings will be open during construction. As always, drivers are urged to use caution when traveling through the project corridor, especially when construction workers are present.<br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Larry Pageler, TAPS Director</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9a282d9b80727046012375a36f08bcac"><name>hire-education</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Hire Education video contest winner chosen</title><summary>Film and digital media major Adam Mieuli, who just graduated in June, won our contest with his creative video that featured both style and substance. </summary><keywords>Hire Education, Adam Mieuli</keywords><start-date>1309852800000</start-date><display-name>Hire Education</display-name><path>/2011/06/hire-education</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/06/hire-education</link><created-by>lmnielse</created-by><created-on>1308256382249</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1313533718583</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/06/images/mieuli-adam-hire-ed-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/06/images/mieuli-adam-hire-ed-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mieuli-adam-hire-ed-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>mieuli-adam-hire-ed-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>2251</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Adam Mieuli Hire Education film thumbnail</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><h2>We've chosen the winner of the UC Santa Cruz Hire Education video contest!</h2>

The California Current, which flows southward along the U.S. west coast, and the North Pacific Transition Zone, a boundary between cold subarctic water and warmer subtropical water, are both hot spots for large marine predators, the study found.</p>
<p>"These are the areas where food is most abundant, and it's all driven by high primary productivity at the base of the food chain--these areas are the grasslands of the sea," said coauthor Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "We tagged over 20 species--including whales, tuna, albatrosses, sharks, and turtles--and we can see where and when they overlap. This is valuable information for efforts to manage and protect critical species and ecosystems."</p>
<p>The new paper is the culmination of the TOPP program's decade-long effort to track the movements of top marine predators in the Pacific Ocean. It provides a remarkable picture of migration pathways and critical habitats for these species. TOPP was conceived by Costa and Barbara Block of Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station. They joined with Steven Bograd of the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center, Randy Kochevar of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and others to launch the project in 2000. Although results for some individual species have been published previously, the <em>Nature</em> paper is the first to present the results for all 23 tagged species and look at how their migrations and habitat preferences overlap.</p>
<p>"This is the first publication that pulls all of the pieces together in one place," said Costa, who oversaw the tracking of marine mammals, birds, and turtles. "We brought together a large team of investigators to study diverse species and look at how these organisms use the ocean. It was unprecedented to examine so many species over such a large scale."</p>
<p>The study used a variety of technologies to track the movements of different species. Sophisticated electronic tagging devices were developed to enable detailed tracking of each animal's location, as well as environmental variables such as water temperature, salinity, and depth. Altogether, the project deployed 4,306 electronic tags on the 23 species, yielding a huge amount of data for the team to analyze.</p>
<p>The results suggest that water temperature may play a key role in driving the seasonal migrations of many species. This was particularly evident in the large marine ecosystem defined by the California Current, where cool, nutrient-rich water moves south along the coast. Correlations between animal movements and satellite measurements of sea surface temperatures suggest that seasonal warming in the south may trigger northward migration of many predator populations, while cooler temperatures in the north trigger southward migrations.</p>
<p>This work is a first step toward using satellite observations of ocean conditions to predict where these large predators will be. The ability to predict the areas that animals are using in the vast Pacific basin was the goal of the TOPP project when it was begun in 2000, and it remains one of the most important aspects of the team's ongoing research. "By knowing where animals are we can better manage the resources and their futures," Block said. "The ability to observe ocean conditions and predict where individual species are likely to be is fundamental to the concept of ecosystem-based management."</p>
<p>Many predators spend their whole lives within the California Current, but others migrate vast distances across the Pacific Ocean to reach its rich waters, which support abundant populations of prey such as krill, sardines, anchovies, and squid. Tagged animals that migrated to the California Current included leatherback turtles from Papua New Guinea, shearwaters from New Zealand, and tuna and loggerhead turtles from Japan. "It's an incredibly important feature--animals keep coming back to it, and some, like California sea lions, live entirely within the California Current," Costa said.</p>
<p>The other hot spot is the North Pacific Transition Zone (NPTZ), which extends across the North Pacific from Japan to Washington state. It is like a weather front in the ocean, where warm and cool masses of water meet and mix. The NPTZ serves as an east-west migration corridor and foraging region for elephant seals, sharks, albatrosses, tuna, and other predators.</p>
<p>The researchers also used tracking data to examine the partitioning of habitats by closely related species. Different species of tuna, for example, prefer different water temperatures, and these preferences correlate with physiological differences between the species. In addition to developing new tracking technologies and techniques, the researchers had to manage large datasets and synthesize different kinds of data for the final analyses. A team of researchers from Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, played an important role in data analysis. "The number of coauthors represents the complexity of working with multiple species, multiple tools, and large datasets," Costa said.</p>
<p>In addition to Block and Costa, the coauthors include Ian Jonsen, Arlis Winship, and Greg Breed of Dalhousie University; Salvador Jorgensen, James Ganong, Alan Swithenbank, and Mike Castleton of Stanford University; Scott Shaffer of San Jose State University; Steven Bograd, Elliott Hazen, Dave Foley, Heidi Dewar, and Scott Benson of the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center; Autumn-Lynn Harrison, Michael Weise, and Bill Henry of UC Santa Cruz; Bruce Mate of Oregon State University; and Kurt Schaefer of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission.</p>

<p>In the case of one recent UCSC graduate, it almost did.</p>
<p>History of Consciousness Program grad Peter Miller received his Ph.D. last week at the Graduate Division commencement ceremony. It took him 40 years.</p>
<p>"I'm probably the person who has the record of how long it took to complete a doctoral degree (at UCSC)," said Miller, 66, who lined up with a crowd of students, some of them as much as four decades younger than him, last week at the <a href="graduate-students-celebrate.xml">Graduate Division commencement ceremony</a> <a href="graduate-students-celebrate.xml"></a><a href="#" title="graduate students celebrate">o</a>n the East Field.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, he's been pursuing his UCSC advanced degree in political theory and community technology since 1971. Back in 1975, he wrote his qualifying essay and passed his oral examination. All that remained was to write his dissertation.</p>
<p>Why did it take so long? Rest assured that Miller did not spend all four decades grinding out that thesis at the rate of one word per day. It would be more accurate to say that he took a long break from it. Careers, the protest movement, and family intervened.</p>
<p>Timing also played a pivotal role in his long, long pursuit of a Ph.D.</p>
<p>Miller, part of Oberlin College's 1967 graduating class, entered graduate school at UC Berkeley. He couldn't have chosen a more tumultuous time to enroll.</p>
<p>He started out there in the 1967-1968 school year at the height of the protest movement in response to the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>There was simply too much going on outside the classroom. In 1968 alone, students and faculty teamed up to hold a "Vietnam Commencement" protest, Joan Baez was addressing young scholars about draft resistance, and students held a new demonstration almost every day.</p>
<p>"It was such an exciting, exhausting place to be," Miller said as he stood in his graduation robes outside the East Field House.</p>
<p>Miller was invited to an endless parade of anti-war activities and draft counseling sessions.</p>
<p>"During my Berkeley year, it wasn't that it was so difficult, or impossible, to study," Miller said. "In fact, the political turmoil underlined the importance and value of the study of political theory." At the same time, "it was overwhelming, and some 'brief' time away from the university did make some sense at that point.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the time away was far from brief.</p>
<p>After putting his studies on hold, Miller relocated to Boston, where he found work in a mental hospital.</p>
Four years later, he found out that a number of his Berkeley graduate school instructors and department colleagues had relocated to UC Santa Cruz, so he decided to leave Boston, move to Santa Cruz, and re-enroll as a graduate student.&#160; 
<p>That stint at UCSC was short-lived, and Miller ended up back in New England for the next three decades.</p>
<p>In that time, he worked for nonprofit organizations that developed technology education and access programs to help people in rural and urban low-income, low-literacy and otherwise underserved communities. He became a leader in the community technology field, founding two national organizations/projects and a publication, "The Community Technology Review" (<a href="http://www.comtechreview.org/">www.comtechreview.org</a>), that he edited for twelve years.</p>
<p>Finally, he decided, once again to give the Ph.D. another shot. His wife, Karen, agreed to support him in his dissertation work so long as he took up "grandpa duties" and looked after his older son's two kids.</p>
<p>Though he is now, once again, a full-time East Coast resident, and finished up his studies late last year, he traveled out to California to visit his family, attend the ceremony, and catch up with friends and colleagues who are still around.</p>
<p>Miller said he is "incredibly grateful for the magic time" of his graduation and Santa Cruz visit.</p>
<p>Miller is not the only one who is enthusiastic about his achievement. While preparing to line up for the graduate school commencement procession, Chancellor George Blumenthal was so excited to hear about Miller's accomplishment that he rushed over to congratulate him.</p>
<p>"Wow!" he said to Miller. "What a wonderful story."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9e8dd60e80727046012375a366c035b2"><name>graduate-students-celebrate</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Eclectic group of graduate students celebrates achievement at East Field</title><summary>An eclectic group of UCSC graduate students – including nearly 400 master’s degree candidates, and 231 doctoral candidates -- were awarded advanced degrees last week in a ceremony that honored determination and hard work. &#13;

<p>Among the group were 100 students scheduled to complete the UCSC education master&#8217;s program by late summer.</p>
<p>The students wore the customary robes, but they also accessorized; some wore leis assembled from fresh flower petals, one degree candidate walked barefoot, and two parents &#8211; both on the verge of graduating from the History of Consciousness program &#8211; carried their baby with them. Some degree candidates wore battered sneakers for comfort. Others teetered on high heels, or walked across the field in thick boots.</p>
<p>Students from various disciplines, and many fields of interest, stood together and mingled. Outside the East Field House, biologists, robotics experts, budding teachers and philosophers shared the same space.</p>
<p>Kaija Mortensen stood in the shade as she waited for the procession to begin. Mortensen took seven years to earn her Ph.D. in philosophy. During that time, she became interested in contemporary debates about the role of intuition in philosophical arguments.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know I was interested in this subject until I took a seminar with (philosophy professor Paul Roth,&#8221; Mortensen said. &#8220;He&#8217;s my advisor. He&#8217;ll be hooding me today.&#8221;</p>
<p>She is referring to a traditional ceremony in which an advisor places a &#8220;doctoral hood&#8221; on the head of a successful Ph.D. candidate.</p>
<p>Soon she will head to North Carolina, where she will be an assistant professor of philosophy at Davidson College, a small liberal arts college.</p>
<p>Nearby, Anna Zivian waited to receive her Ph.D. in environmental studies. It took her 7 &#189; years to earn the degree. The subject of her dissertation is &#8220;Subnational Government Regulation of Genetically Modified Organisms in the United States and the European Union.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before entering UCSC as a grad student, she held two important leadership positions in Colorado. Zivian served on the town council in Telluride, and also served as a commissioner in San Miguel County. Her public service influenced her choice of topic at UCSC.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was interested in the role of local government in making policy,&#8221; said Zivian, who is now working for the Ocean Conservancy, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group.</p>
<p>I am also food-obsessed, and concerned about genetically modified organisms.&#8221;&#160; Her doctoral work was a way to tie these fields of interest together.</p>
<p>Her time at UCSC helped shape her goals for the Ph.D. program. &#8220;What kind of information do you need to make the best decisions about environmental issues, especially when emerging technologies are coming into play and you don&#8217;t know all of the risks?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Alexander Gonzalez, president of Sacramento State University, and a UCSC alumnus, reflected on the graduate students&#8217; long-term commitment during his keynote address at the ceremony. Such a long-termed sustained focus on complex problems is especially important &#8220;in an age when communication and attention spans come and go at electron speeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gonzalez said this made their achievement all the more impressive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Graduates, today you join the less than 8 percent of adults in the United States who have master&#8217;s degrees, and the less than 3 percent who have doctorates. More than ever before, people are going to look to you for answers to the world&#8217;s most complex problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you have succeeded in the education process,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;you are equipped to handle choices and challenges you may not yet be able to imagine. And trust me when I say that life is certain to give you that chance.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9fd295bc80727046012375a3cc2ebc6c"><name>mary-doyle-scup-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus IT leader wins service award</title><summary>Mary Doyle, vice chancellor for information technology, has been named the Society for College and University Planning (SCUP) 2011 Distinguished Service Award Recipient. </summary><keywords>Mary Doyle, vice chancellor for information technology, Society for College and University Planning, SCUP, 2011 Distinguished Service Award Recipient. </keywords><start-date>1308297600000</start-date><display-name>Campus IT leader wins service award</display-name><path>/2011/06/mary-doyle-scup-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/06/mary-doyle-scup-award</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1308351436111</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenm</last-modified-by><last-modified>1308351727321</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/06/images/mary2.gif</path><link>site://news/2011/06/images/mary2.gif</link><site>news</site><name>mary2.gif</name><display-name>mary2.gif</display-name><file-size>10651</file-size><width>96</width><height>129</height></image><image-alt>Mary Doyle</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Mary Doyle, vice chancellor for information technology</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Mary Doyle, vice chancellor for information technology, has been named the Society for College and University Planning (SCUP) 2011 Distinguished Service Award Recipient. <br/>
<br/>
This award recognizes exceptional contributions to the activities and success of SCUP. Recipients are nominated and selected on the basis of their contributions to the organization, length of service, and commitment to its purposes, goals and activities. This award began in 1989.<br/>
<br/>
Doyle has been vice chancellor for information technology at UC Santa Cruz since 2008. Her responsibilities include strategy and oversight for networking and telecommunications, applications and project management, learning technologies, client services and security, local support, and IT resource management. Previously, she served as vice provost for academic planning, budget, and resource management and vice president for information technology at Washington State University. Before joining WSU, Doyle served as assistant provost at UC Santa Barbara. She held senior research analyst positions in institutional research at both UC Santa Barbara and Arizona State University.<br/>
<br/>
She has served in numerous roles in SCUP since joining the organization in 1985, including Annual Conference and Idea Marketplace Conference Chair for SCUP-42 in Chicago, July 2007, and Pacific Regional Representative, serving on the board of directors 2001-2002. Doyle established the Pacific Regional Council and planned and chaired a number of regional conferences. She has also served for six consecutive years as a member of three SCUP planning academies. She recently completed a term as convener of the Academic Planning Academy. She has presented and convened sessions and workshops at both regional and national SCUP conferences, and reviewed articles and co-edited a book for the organization.<br/>
<br/>
She was a member of and co-chaired SCUP's Publications Advisory Committee (PAC). While serving on PAC several years ago, her "non-facility" perspective to planning was greatly valued by other committee members.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to her SCUP membership, she also is a member of EDUCAUSE and other information technology associations.<br/>
<br/>
She holds a BS in computer information systems and an MBA from Arizona State University. She earned a Ph.D. in educational leadership and organizations from UC Santa Barbara.<br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="af1f0bfb80727046012375a3725984e7"><name>email-calendar-changeover-Google</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus set to retire Cruzmail, Oracle calendar </title><summary>In a two-phase switchover, the UC Santa Cruz campus will retire its homegrown e-mail system and Oracle calendar system and replace them with new, updated versions supplied by Google.</summary><start-date>1308556800000</start-date><display-name>E-mail, calendar changes</display-name><path>/2011/06/email-calendar-changeover-Google</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/06/email-calendar-changeover-Google</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1308608105327</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1308870729685</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/06/images/googlelogo.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/06/images/googlelogo.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>googlelogo.jpg</name><display-name>googlelogo.jpg</display-name><file-size>13278</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Google to supply e-mail and calendar services</article-subhead><article-text><p>In a two-phase switchover, the UC Santa Cruz campus will retire its homegrown e-mail system and Oracle calendar system and replace them with new, updated versions supplied by Google.</p>
<p>The campus will retire CruzMail late in fall quarter 2011, and move faculty and staff e-mail to Google Apps for Education.</p>
<p>The entire student population has already been moved to Google e-mail as of March 2010.&#160;</p>
<p>CruzTime will then be retired and the calendar system will move to Google during spring quarter 2012.</p>
<p>Lisa Bono, a spokesperson for UCSC Information Technology Services, said Google Apps for Education will dramatically increase the level of service provided to the campus &#8211; storage, reliability, and security with a &#8220;robust and innovative feature set.&#8221;</p>
<p>The move is supported by an agreement between the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) and Google. The contract does not require individual campuses to make the switch to Google; instead, it gives each campus permission to implement the Google Apps for Education service.</p>
<p>In the case of UCSC, the campus has decided to participate because its e-mail and calendar systems have become out of date and have reached full potential, Bono said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t grow any further with these systems unless we put a lot of money and resources into them, and we just don&#8217;t have the ability to do that with the budget constraints,&#8221; Bono said. &#8220;When the campus looked for next-generation solutions, Google Apps was the best choice. Plus it&#8217;s free.&#8221;</p>
<p>ITS will provide training opportunities in the coming months.</p>
<p>Bono emphasized that @ucsc.edu e-mail addresses will remain the same. Existing e-mails, files, and current calendar data, will transfer to the new systems and staff and faculty may continue using Outlook, Thunderbird, Apple Mail, or other clients to access UCSC e-mail.</p>

<br/>
Founded by legendary mandolinists David Grisman and Mike Marshall, the annual Mandolin Symposium at UC Santa Cruz is now heading into its eighth year, beginning on June 26.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;For six days we turn Santa Cruz into mandolin heaven,&#8221; said Marshall, who just performed at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival last weekend.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;We have 10 of the greatest mandolinists in the world converging in the hills above your city, with over 100 students just soaking up every conceivable style from classical to jazz, bluegrass, Irish, Brazilian, old timey. The works!&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Marshall was invited to join the original David Grisman Quintet in 1979 at the tender age of 19.</p>
<p>He has since performed and recorded with some of the top names in acoustic music, including Tony Rice, Darol Anger, Mark O' Connor, Stephane Grappelli, Bela Fleck, and Chris Thile of Nickel Creek.<br/>
<br/>
Bringing with them nearly a dozen other mandolin masters, Grisman and Marshall hope to expose students of all levels to the incredible variety of mandolin music and technique developed throughout the world.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;David Grisman and I have thrown this giant net over the whole of the musical world, and we are using the mandolin as our compass,&#8221; Marshall noted.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Many people don't know that the mandolin traveled all over the world when it left Italy in the late 19th century, and since then has reinvented itself in each new place that it has been,&#8221; he added.<br/>
<br/>
Each day at the UCSC symposium begins with a music appreciation class, where students listen to--and view--historic performances hand-selected by the faculty.<br/>
<br/>
A variety of elective classes follow, from beginning to advanced, with students given the opportunity to create small ensembles in the many different styles of mandolin music.<br/>
<br/>
Evening sessions feature special performances and workshops by the instructors, with organized jam sessions beginning each night around 10 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
The weeklong symposium ends with a public concert on Friday, July 1, at 7 p.m. in the Stevenson Event Center.<br/>
<br/>
This year&#8217;s show will feature <strong>David Grisman, Mike Marshall, Don Stiernberg (swing and jazz), Mike Compton (bluegrass), Eric Thompson (old time), Chris Acquavella (classical), Marla Fibish (Irish traditional)</strong>, and <strong>Choro Famoso (Brazilian)</strong>&#8212;plus a piece performed by all the students of the Mandolin Symposium.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It's an incredible six-day mando-freak out! With some of the best players and teachers in the world.... that's all,&#8221; said Marshall.<br/>
<br/>
Tickets to the concert and registration information for the symposium are both available at the UCSC Mandolin Symposium <a href="http://www.mandolinsymposium.com/symposium2011/">web site</a><br/>

Frick</a> and <a href="http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/people/kilpatrick/">A. Marm Kilpatrick</a>, have won a $2 million National Science Foundation (NSF) grant to study the spread of a fungus that is decimating bat populations in the northeastern United States.<br/>
<br/>
The fungus causes "white-nose syndrome" that is blamed for the deaths of more than 70 percent of the little brown bat population in the northeast, said Frick, an NSF bioinformatics post-doctoral fellow in UCSC's Environmental Studies department.&#160; <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/08/3957.html">Earlier work by Frick and colleague Tom Kunz</a> at Boston University predicts the bat populations may become extinct over the next 15 years if the fungus's spread cannot be halted.<br/>
<br/>
"We want to understand the transmission and spread of the pathogen that causes white-nose syndrome," Frick said. The five-year grant is from the NSF's ecology of infectious disease program.<br/>
<br/>
Frick and Kilpatrick, a UCSC assistant professor of ecology &amp; evolutionary biology, will work with Kunz and colleagues from the University of Tennessee and Northern Arizona University. The team will investigate the origin, life cycle, and both seasonal and spatial transmission of the mysterious disease.<br/>
<br/>
Discovered near Albany, N.Y. in 2006, the fungus disrupts bats' hibernation, causing them to awake early, behave oddly, and lose critical fat reserves, resulting in death. It already affects nine bat species across the northeast.<br/>
<br/>
"Kilpatrick will use the data collected from the field studies to build a model of transmission dynamics that can be used to predict the impact of the disease on bats, and to highlight potential management opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
In particular, Kilpatrick said, they will examine how the "sociality" of different bat populations influences how the fungus spreads.&#160; "The big scientific question is to try to understand how differences in sociality -- group size and mixing patterns &#8211; increase or decrease transmission within a population," Kilpatrick said.<br/>
<br/>
The research will provide critical information on the factors driving the spread of the fungus between individuals, among hibernation locations such as caves within a region, and across North America.&#160; The information can be used to predict the impact of the fungus on bat populations and is likely to identify species and populations of greatest concern.<br/>
<br/>
Kilpatrick is a disease ecologist and expert on West Nile virus and chytrid fungus in amphibians who joined the UCSC faculty in 2008.<br/>
<br/>
Frick, who currently is in Texas studying bat populations using weather radar, received her B.A. in environmental studies at UCSC (Porter '98). She completed her Ph.D. at Oregon State University in 2007 and currently holds a joint appointment at UCSC and Boston University.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="be0a322280727046012375a32f3faf56"><name>whistleblower</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>California Whistleblower Protection Act - Annual Notice</title><summary>Provisions of the California Whistleblower Protection Act require the University to post notices regarding the Act and, on an annual basis, to provide a copy of the notice to all employees who have UC authorized access to email.</summary><keywords>whistleblower</keywords><start-date>1308816000000</start-date><display-name> Whistleblower Protection Act </display-name><path>/2011/06/whistleblower</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/06/whistleblower</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1308858397003</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1308858397003</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Provisions of the California Whistleblower Protection Act (Government Code Sections 8545.2 and 8548.3) require the University to post notices regarding the Act and, on an annual basis, to provide a copy of the notice to all employees who have UC authorized access to email.

Hamilton earlier this week.<br/>
<br/>
Mountain residents recalled the visit was the first in at least 30 years, said John Wareham, who lives on the mountain and is deputy director of operations for Lick Observatory managed and operated by UC Santa Cruz. The giant scavengers were first spotted Tuesday, June 21, and also visited the next day, he said.<br/>
<br/>
Lick staff members watched in awe and captured dozens of images as the birds flew by and landed on one of the domes and fire watchtower.<br/>
<br/>
"Seeing the five condors was an incredible experience and historic," said astronomer Elinor Gates. "Their talons clattered on the metal roof as they walked around." Resident golden eagles and turkey vultures looked small in comparison, she said.<br/>

California Condors have a wingspan up to 9&#189; feet and nearly became extinct. Still classified as endangered, the birds are staging a comeback as the result of breeding programs in the Pinnacles National Monument and along the Big Sur coast. Condor experts speculated the Mt. Hamilton visitors were a flock of relative youngsters who usually hang out in the Pinnacles.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_18341487</url><title>Mercury News article</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.peregrinefund.org/explore_raptors/vultures/cacondor.html</url><title>Peregrine Fund condor site</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d37c9d3480727046012375a34774bbda"><name>ucsc-in-the-news-6-27-11</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>Results from the 10-year Tagging of Pacific Predators study by professor of ecology and evolutionary biology Daniel Costa and colleagues attracted worldwide news coverage after their article appeared in the journal Nature.</summary><start-date>1309248000000</start-date><display-name>ucsc-in-the-news-6-27-11</display-name><path>/2011/06/ucsc-in-the-news-6-27-11</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/06/ucsc-in-the-news-6-27-11</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1309218217144</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1309273831540</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Results from the 10-year Tagging of Pacific Predators study by professor of ecology and evolutionary biology Daniel Costa and colleagues attracted worldwide news coverage after their article appeared in the journal <strong><em>Nature</em></strong>.

<p>--Warren Sack</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Warren Sack named associate director of new Data &amp; Democracy Initiative</article-subhead><article-text><p>How can we as citizens use technology to contribute to the public good?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a key question fueling the research of UC Santa Cruz associate professor of film and digital media Warren Sack.</p>
<p>Sack has just been appointed associate director of a new &#8220;Data and Democracy&#8221; initiative established by <a href="http://citris-uc.org/">CITRIS</a>&#8212;the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society&#8212;a joint venture of four University of California campuses.&#160;</p>
<p><span class="caps">CITRIS</span> was founded in 2000 to help UC researchers create and apply technology solutions to the major challenges faced by California and the world&#8212;ranging from climate change to communications.</p>
<p>Sack will embark on the new cross-campus Data and Democracy initiative with two UC Berkeley professors&#8212;professor of new media Ken Goldberg, who will lead the project, and art professor Greg Niemeyer, who has also been named associate director.</p>
<p>The goal of the initiative is to influence communications technologies such as social media to provide ways for people to become personally involved in critical issues that affect their government and community.</p>
<p>To do this, the Data and Democracy Initiative will collaborate with partners such as the <strong>UC Santa Cruz Center for Games and Playable Media</strong> and <strong>UC Berkeley&#8217;s Center for New Media</strong>, along with various other research centers, government, and non-profit organizations.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Social media today has been about connecting with family and friends,&#8221; Sack observed. &#8220;The next phase of social media has to be connecting with each other as citizens, and making it possible to take action.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An early example of this was <a href="http://moveon.org" title="MoveOn.Org">moveon.org</a>&#8212;which began as just an email list, but actually catalyzed a whole political movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>A software designer and media theorist, Sack is also chair of the UC Santa Cruz Digital Art and New Media (<span class="caps">DANM</span>) graduate program. His work explores theories and designs for online public space and public discussion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think of computer and information technology as a history of users,&#8221; Sack noted. &#8220;The first users were soldiers and the military. The next users were in the workplace. Following that was personalized media&#8212;doing things at home. And then it was friends and family through social media.&#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;The next step is citizen-centered media,&#8221; Sack said. &#8220;In many ways, the Arab Spring (recent Mid-East unrest) seems to be the result of this shift.&#8221;</p>
<p>Examples of projects under the Data and Democracy initiative include <a href="http://metavid.org/" title="Metavid - Open Video Archive of the US Congress">Metavid</a>, an archive of legislative video from both houses of the U.S. Congress&#8212;created in 2006 by two <span class="caps">UCSC</span> grad students. It blends video with a wiki format, allowing users to improve the Congressional archive&#8217;s accuracy by correcting transcripts and annotating speeches.</p>
<p>Another project is <strong>Peer to <span class="caps">PCAST</span></strong> (President&#8217;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology)&#8212;a site that enables peer review of expert scientific testimony within government proceedings.</p>
<p>&#8220;We invite high profile scientists to say what they think of the testimony,&#8221; said Sack. &#8220;The idea is that if you develop the right kind of web site, you can allow people to peer review the advice the government is getting. You&#8217;re not just saying you &#8216;like&#8217; or &#8216;don&#8217;t like&#8217; it. You actually have a role to play.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sack noted that the goal of the new Data and Democracy Initiative lies in the basic question: Can we affect the way business is done by government and local communities on the web?</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, with <strong>Peer to <span class="caps">PCAST</span></strong>, we looked at the web site of President Obama&#8217;s advisory council and we then built new software and made it better,&#8221; Sack explained. &#8220;Our goal is to produce something we hope they will use, adopt, and change. And if we&#8217;re effective, we produce a better alternative to what&#8217;s there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the perfect research topic for a public university,&#8221; notes Sack. &#8220;No one in government has time to try out alternatives. So we produce better alternatives, give them away, and move on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a terrible business model,&#8220; Sack admits. &#8220;But our purpose is simply to produce alternatives for the public good.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2007/05/1268.html</url><title>UCSC receives $157,000 to support open archive of congressional proceedings</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://review.ucsc.edu/spring06/RevSp06-pp16-17_Pixels.pdf</url><title>Pixels in the Public Interest</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d885e85e80727046012375a3a2c27477"><name>retirements-9-09-3-11</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Recent retirements, September 2009 - March 2011</title><summary>A listing of staff and faculty members who retired during the period of September 2009 through March 2011.</summary><keywords>staff, faculty, retired, retirement</keywords><start-date>1309248000000</start-date><display-name>Retirements, September 2009 - March 2011</display-name><path>/2011/06/retirements-9-09-3-11</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/06/retirements-9-09-3-11</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1309302712159</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenm</last-modified-by><last-modified>1310067609386</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Retirements</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/06/images/retirement-vista.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/06/images/retirement-vista.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>retirement-vista.jpg</name><display-name>retirement-vista.jpg</display-name><file-size>1502</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>The following staff and faculty members retired during the period of September 2009 through March 2011.

Ovarian serous adenocarcinoma tumors from 500 patients were examined by <a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov">The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network</a>; the analyses are reported in the June 30 issue of Nature.</p>
<p>A team of UCSC researchers contributed to the analysis, led by David Haussler, distinguished professor of biomolecular engineering, and Josh Stuart, associate professor of biomolecular engineering in the <a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a>. Their work focused on understanding the molecular pathways in the cell that are disrupted in ovarian cancer.<br/>
<br/>
"A pathway is a collection of genes that talk to each other in the cell," Haussler said. "Josh Stuart did the analysis to see whether certain pathways were characteristically disrupted in ovarian cancer, and he found one very strong pathway that is disrupted in advanced ovarian cancer."</p>
<p><strong>Most prevalent form</strong></p>
<p>Serous adenocarcinoma is the most prevalent form of ovarian cancer, accounting for about 85 percent of all ovarian cancer deaths.&#160; TCGA researchers completed whole-exome sequencing, which examines the protein-coding regions of the genome, on an unprecedented 316 tumors.&#160; They also completed other genomic characterizations on these tumors and another 173 specimens.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;This landmark study is producing impressive insights into the biology of this type of cancer,&#8221; said NIH Director Francis Collins, M.D., Ph.D.&#160; &#8220;It will significantly empower the cancer research community to make additional discoveries that will help us treat women with this deadly disease. It also illustrates the power of what&#8217;s to come from our investment in TCGA.&#8221;</p>
<p>TCGA is jointly funded and managed by the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov">National Cancer Institute</a> (NCI) and the <a href="http://www.genome.gov">National Human Genome Research Institute</a> (NHGRI), both part of the <a href="http://www.nih.gov">National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UCSC's role</strong></p>
<p>Haussler helped assemble the first working draft of the human genome and now leads efforts to use the information encoded in the genome sequence to transform the practice of medicine and our understanding of biology.&#160; He joined the UCSC faculty in 1986 and earned his B.A. in mathematics from Connecticut College, an M.S. in applied mathematics from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Colorado, Boulder.</p>
<p>Stuart joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 2003 and is affiliated with the <a href="http://www.cbse.ucsc.edu/">Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering</a> headed by Haussler. He earned a B.S. in computer science and a B.A. in molecular, cell, and developmental biology from the University of Colorado, Boulder, and a Ph.D. in biomedical informatics form Stanford University. In 2006, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation selected him as a Sloan Research fellow to support his research in developing computational tools for studying how genes work an identifying networks of genes involved in important biological functions.</p>
<p><strong>Mutations in a single gene</strong></p>
<p>Among the specific findings described in the Nature paper is the confirmation that mutations in a single gene, TP53, are present in more than 96 percent of all such cancers. TP53 encodes a tumor suppressor protein that normally prevents cancer formation.&#160; Mutations in the gene disrupt this protein&#8217;s function, which contributes to uncontrolled growth of ovarian cells.&#160; In addition, TCGA identified a multitude of less-frequent mutations in other genes.&#160;</p>
<p>TCGA researchers also established how sets of genes are expressed in a fashion that can predict patient survival&#8212; identifying patterns for 108 genes associated with poor survival and 85 genes associated with better survival.&#160; Patients whose tumors had a gene-expression signature associated with poor survival lived for a period that was 23 percent shorter than patients whose tumors did not have such a signature.&#160; The overall five-year survival rate for ovarian cancer is 31 percent, which means that 69 percent of patients diagnosed this year will not be alive in 2016, highlighting the urgent need for a better understanding of the disease.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The new knowledge of the genomic changes in ovarian cancer has revealed that the molecular catalysts of this disease are not limited to small changes affecting individual genes,&#8221; said NCI Director Harold E. Varmus, M.D. &#8220;Also important are large structural changes that occur in these cancer genomes. Cancer researchers can use this comprehensive body of information to better understand the biology of ovarian cancer and improve the diagnosis and treatment of this dreaded disease.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Sixty-eight genes targeted</strong></p>
<p>To identify opportunities for targeted treatment, the investigators searched for existing drugs that might inhibit amplified or over-expressed genes that were suggested to play a role in ovarian cancer. The search identified 68 genes that could be targeted by existing Food and Drug Administration-approved or experimental therapeutic compounds. The investigators noted that one type of drug, a PARP (Poly ADP ribose polymerase) inhibitor, might be able to counteract the DNA repair gene observed in half of the ovarian tumors studied.&#160; While researchers have known that these drugs could be effective against the disease, this study revealed that 50 percent of tumors might be responsive to drugs that exploit the genetic instability of the tumors and induce the cancer cells to die.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;Like all cancers, ovarian cancer results from genomic derangements,&#8221; said Eric D. Green, M.D., Ph.D., NHGRI director. &#8220;The efforts of TCGA are confirming that the more we learn about genomic changes in tumor cells, the more we will be able to care for the people affected by cancer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The results of this study support the existence of four distinct subtypes of the disease, based on the patterns seen in the transcription of RNA from DNA.&#160; They also support the existence of four related subtypes based on the patterns of DNA methylation&#8212;a chemical reaction in which a small molecule called a methyl group is added to DNA, changing the activity of individual genes. These patterns likely reflect the functional changes associated with ovarian serous adenocarcinoma, but are not strongly associated with survival duration.</p>
<p><strong>Increased risk</strong></p>
<p>Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are associated with some forms of breast cancer, also confer increased risk for ovarian cancer.&#160; In this study, approximately 21 percent of the tumors showed mutations in these genes. Analysis of these tumors confirmed observations that patients with mutated BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have better survival odds than patients without mutations in these genes.</p>
<p>Importantly, investigators identified that the mechanism by which the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes become defective also relates to survival.&#160; If either of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes is mutated, there is improved survival duration. However, if BRCA1 activity is instead reduced by methylation, there is no improved survival duration.</p>
<p>&#8220;The integration of complex genomic data sets enabled us to discover an intricate array of genomic changes and validate one specific change that occurs in the vast majority of all ovarian cancers,&#8221; said lead author Paul T. Spellman, Ph.D., Lawrence Berkeley. &#8220;Significantly, we have also found new information regarding the role that the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes play in determining survival.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this latest study, the TCGA researchers built upon the approach they used in 2008 to characterize the genome of gliobastoma multiforme, the most common form of brain cancer.</p>
<p>TCGA, launched in 2006, is a comprehensive and coordinated effort to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of genome analysis technologies, including large-scale genome sequencing. TCGA data are being made rapidly available to the research community through a database, http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga. The database provides direct access to most analytic datasets, with other data, such as patient treatment records and raw DNA sequence data, available to qualified researchers through an NIH review and approval process.</p>
<p>Future TCGA analyses of over 20 other tumor types will be primarily funded using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) monies.<br/>

<br/>
As of May 1, UCSC had received 4,119 Statements of Intent to Register (SIRs) from prospective freshmen. The final number of new students who decide to enroll will not be known until September. UCSC had placed more than 1,100 freshmen on a waitlist, but given the number of SIRs received, the campus was unable to admit any waitlisted students.<br/>
<br/>
"We continue to attract highly qualified students to UC Santa Cruz," Chancellor George Blumenthal said. "Their interest is a reflection of the talented people and renowned programs at our campus."<br/>
<br/>
Blumenthal said he was particularly pleased by the sharp increase in interest among underrepresented students.</p>
<p><strong>More California residents</strong></p>
<p>The vast majority of new freshmen are California residents (97.9 percent), up 378 from a year earlier, and the campus also had a small increase in students coming from outside of California.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It is particularly gratifying to have increased the number of students coming from our state,&#8221; said Michelle Whittingham, UCSC's associate vice chancellor of enrollment management and director of admissions. "I believe California students and students from outside our state are drawn to our campus&#8217;s commitment to undergraduate education and world-class research.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
UCSC's anticipates 3,500 freshmen will enroll in fall. The number of SIRs submitted by May 1 is always higher than the eventual fall enrollment for a variety of reasons, Whittingham said, including but not limited to students making a final decision to attend elsewhere, family situations, and final academic outcomes.<br/>
<br/>
Whittingham said many attributes of the incoming class stand out: The students' academic profile remains strong, both in average GPA and test scores. UCSC also continued to attract a high percentage of students from underrepresented ethnic groups, from students coming from low socioeconomic backgrounds, and from students who will be the first in their family to earn a four-year degree.<br/>
<br/>
"The University of California is defined by the quality of its academic programs and by the access to that quality," Whittingham said, "so we are extremely pleased by the academic achievement and diversity of UCSC's incoming freshman class." The average GPA for the incoming freshmen is 3.59. The average SAT-reasoning scores were also strong: 1,696 composite, 559 critical reading, 561 writing, and 576 mathematics.</p>
<p><strong>Increase in underrepresented students</strong></p>
<p>The percentage of underrepresented students among the incoming freshman class increased to 34.9 percent, up from last year's 29.9 percent. Of the incoming frosh, 29.7 percent are Chicano/Latino, and 28.3 percent are Asian American or Pacific Islander.<br/>
<br/>
UC Santa Cruz experienced the highest increase of UC campuses in the number of California African Americans intending to enroll and the second highest increase in the number of California Chicano/Latino students intending to enroll.&#160; Whittingham said she shares deep appreciation for the Student Initiated Outreach programs at UCSC that aim to increase the number of underrepresented students who enroll and graduate from UC Santa Cruz.&#160; During recent graduation ceremonies held on campus, there was a consistent theme of graduates who had first visited campus on these programs.&#160; Their success continues to build excitement and a strong sense of community for students.<br/>
<br/>
"We are especially excited that 44 percent of our incoming freshman class will be the first in their families to earn a four-year college degree, and that 28 percent of the freshmen come from low-income backgrounds (from families earning less than $40,000)," Whittingham added. "All of these numbers underscore our ability to create access and opportunities for highly diverse groups of students, something that our campus takes great pride in."</p>
<p><strong>Community college transfers</strong></p>
<p>The UC system today also released numbers of community college students who have filed SIRs with UC's nine general campuses. At UCSC, 1,615 transfer students from community colleges throughout California have expressed their intent to enroll this fall. UCSC's enrollment target for transfer students in the 2011-12 academic year is 1,250.<br/>
<br/>
"The UC system has made it a priority to expand access to transfer students from California's community colleges, so we are particularly pleased with the strong interest these students have shown in UC Santa Cruz for the coming year," Whittingham said.<br/>

<p>The budget Gov. Jerry Brown signed today includes an additional $150 million cut to the University of California--and it leaves the door open for further cuts if state revenues don't meet expectations. This unwelcome news comes on top of the $500 million cut UC received in March and means that state funding will decline by at least $650 million in the fiscal year that begins tomorrow.&#160;</p>
<p>Although it's too early to say with certainty what this new cut might mean for UCSC, I anticipate that the Regents will consider raising tuition to cover most, if not all, of the additional $150 million budget reduction. Locally, the prospect of another sizable tuition hike underscores the importance of UCSC's student-focused goals, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/05/galloway-goals.html">Five for 2015</a>. We have already begun streamlining major requirements and improving curriculum planning to ensure that students can graduate in four years--or less.</p>
<p>At a policy level,&#160;although this budget leaves much to be desired, at least it is not another of the "smoke and mirrors" budgets we've seen for years. I appreciate the governor&#8217;s attempts to increase revenues to protect higher education, K-12 education, and critical state services, even though he was ultimately unable to persuade key members of the Legislature to join him. Hopefully, this budget will better position UC for funding in the 2012-13 funding cycle.</p>
<p>In the short term, I am disheartened that UC students and their families are bearing the brunt of the state's steadily declining support for the university. In the long term, it is imperative that we all join together to make the case that funding for higher education will benefit all Californians.</p>
<p>At UCSC, Executive Vice Chancellor/Campus Provost Alison Galloway and I are determined to preserve our vibrant research enterprise and the distinctive student experience that is available only at UC Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>Para: La Comunidad de la Universidad</p>
<p>De parte de: Chancellor George Blumenthal</p>
<p>Sobre: Noticias del presupuesto estatal</p>
<p>Ahora que tenemos un presupuesto estatal, el campus debe seguir adelante con la importante labor que estamos hacienda aqui.</p>
<p>El presupuesto que Jerry Brown ha firmado hoy incluye un corte adicional de $150 millones para la Universidad de California--y deja la puerta abierta a nuevos recortes si los ingresos del Estado no cumplen las expectativas. Esta desagradable noticia viene de un recorte de $500.000.000 que la Universidad de California recibi&#243; en marzo y significa que fondos estatales disminuir&#225;n al menos $ 650 millones en el a&#241;o fiscal que comienza manana.</p>
<p>A pesar de que es demasiado pronto para decir con certeza lo que este nuevo recorte podr&#237;a significar para UCSC, preveo que los Regentes se consideran aumentar las cuotas de matr&#237;cula para cubrir la mayor&#237;a, si no toda, de la reducci&#243;n del presupuesto adicional de $150 millones. A nivel local, la perspectiva de otra caminata de matr&#237;cula subraya la importancia de nuestros objetivos centrados en el estudiante, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/05/galloway-goals.html">Five for 2015</a>. Ya hemos empezado a racionalizar los requisitos de los programas del estudio, y mejorar la planificaci&#243;n del curr&#237;culo para asegurar que los estudiantes puedan graduar en cuatro anos--o menos.</p>
<p>En un nivel directivo, a pesar de que este presupuesto deja mucho que desear, por lo menos no es otro de los presupuestos de "humos y espejos" que hemos visto durante anos. Le agradezco los intentos del gobernador en aumentar los ingresos para proteger la educaci&#243;n universitaria, la educacion del K-12, y los servicios criticales del estado, a pesar de que al final no pudo persuadir a los miembros clave de la legislatura a unirse a &#233;l. Se espera que este presupuesto mejorar&#225; la posici&#243;n de UC para su financiaci&#243;n, en el ciclo de financiaci&#243;n 2012-13.</p>
<p>En el corto plazo, estoy desanimado que los estudiantes de UC y sus familias se llevan la peor parte de la disminuci&#243;n del apoyo estatal para la Universidad. En el largo plazo, es imprescindible que todos nos unamos para hacer el caso que la financiaci&#243;n de la educaci&#243;n universitaria se beneficiar&#225;n todos los Californianos.</p>
<p>En UCSC, Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway y yo estamos decididos a preservar nuestra empresa de investigaci&#243;n vibrante y la experiencia de los estudiantes distintiva que s&#243;lo est&#225; disponible en UC Santa Cruz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fb9c9fdb80727046012375a310e83e05"><name>ucop-budget</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Tuition, fee increases sought to meet budget shortfall</title><summary>With cost-cutting and revenue-generating measures in place to fill the bulk of a billion-dollar budget gap resulting from steep cuts in state funding, the University of California staff is preparing to recommend to the Board of Regents that roughly one-quarter of the shortfall be offset with tuition and fee increases, UC Vice President Patrick Lenz said Friday, July 1.</summary><start-date>1309852800000</start-date><display-name>UCOP statement on 2011-2012 budget</display-name><path>/2011/06/ucop-budget</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/06/ucop-budget</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1309891403632</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1309892398040</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/07/images/dollar-sign-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/07/images/dollar-sign-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dollar-sign-80.jpg</name><display-name>dollar-sign-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>20445</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>dollar sign</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>With cost-cutting and revenue-generating measures in place to fill the bulk of a billion-dollar budget gap resulting from steep cuts in state funding, the University of California staff is preparing to recommend to the Board of Regents that roughly one-quarter of the shortfall be offset with tuition and fee increases, UC Vice President Patrick Lenz said Friday, July 1.<br/>
<br/>
Only the Board of Regents can pass a budget or raise tuition. A tuition increase would be among several options presented to the Regents for consideration when they meet July 12-14 in San Francisco.<br/>
<br/>
Lenz, the UC system&#8217;s vice president for budget and capital resources, said it had been determined that an annualized tuition increase of 9.6 percent beyond the 8 percent previously approved by the Regents for the 2011-12 school year would cover nearly $150 million of the $650 million funding reduction in the state budget approved by the state Legislature and signed by Gov. Jerry Brown this week.<br/>
<br/>
Because of these cuts and more than $350 million in unfunded mandatory cost increases largely consisting of unsupported students and rising contributions to the employee retirement plan and health benefits, UC is facing a budget shortfall of $1 billion.<br/>
<br/>
Gov. Brown had proposed a funding reduction of $500 million in January, but the budget plan he signed Thursday (June 30) cut UC&#8217;s funding by $650 million for 2011-12, decreasing state support for the University from a high of $3.25 billion in 2007-08 to $2.37 billion. The total reduction could rise to $750 million if projected state revenues do not materialize.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;We reported to the Regents in May that if we were to receive additional cuts beyond $500 million, we would have to offset those cuts with a dollar-for-dollar tuition increase,&#8221; Lenz said. &#8220;Our campuses and the UC Office of the President already have cut to the bone &#8211; implementing administrative efficiencies, furloughing and laying off employees, consolidating and eliminating programs, increasing class sizes, delaying faculty hires, reducing services and delaying purchases, among other actions.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Lenz added: &#8220;We will present to the Regents a variety of measures that we believe will preserve the quality of education, research and public service benefiting Californians in every part of the state, and ensure access to students from families with low and moderate incomes through financial aid.&#8221;<br/>
