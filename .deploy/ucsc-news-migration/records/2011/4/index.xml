[photo by Dan White]</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Tobias Wolff wishes he could say that reading Thomas Mann started him out on the road to becoming an author.&#160; He remembers reading an interview with Susan Sontag in which she talked about reading Mann and Kierkegaard when she was still in grade school.</p>
<p>"She was very precocious," he said, dryly, during his opening remarks at the first night of the Humanities Division&#8217;s Living Writers reading series, which drew a capacity crowd to the Humanities Lecture Hall on Thursday.</p>
<p>Every one of us has an author like that, said Wolff,&#160; author of the novels&#160;<em>The Barracks Thief</em> and <em>Old School,&#160;</em>the memoirs&#160;<em>This Boy's Life</em> and <em>In Pharaoh's Army,</em>&#160;and the short story collections&#160;<em>In the Garden of the North American Martyrs</em>, <em>Back in the World</em>, and&#160;<em>The Night in Question</em>.</p>
<p>"You look back and think about who it was that made you store up extra batteries in your flashlight so you could stay up reading, and put towels under the doorway so your parents couldn&#8217;t see the light shining in the room."</p>
<p>For Wolff, a creative writing and English professor at Stanford University, that man was Albert Payson Terhune,&#160; a writer and dog breeder who surrounded himself with collies, which he described as a "tawny swarm." Terhune found fame writing genre fiction about his dogs &#8211; with many of narratives told from the point of view of the dog.</p>
<p>On Thursday night, Wolff talked about the way an author can store up readings, encounters and experiences over time and how these things can make their way into a creative work years later, taking the writer by surprise. Terhune&#8217;s books were the first "reading binge" Wolff ever went on.</p>
<p>Though Wolff now thinks Terhune was "probably certifiable," he found himself drawn right back to those collies with one of his latest stories, "Her Dog," in which a man has a prolonged conversation with his dead wife&#8217;s dog. Together they converse about fidelity, marriage, mortality and friendship, and have a tense standoff with a vicious dog and its thuggish &#8211; and curiously litigious &#8211; owner.</p>
<p>"I could not have written this story without Albert Payson Terhune," Wolff said.&#160;</p>
<p>All those childhood reading binges finally paid off, more than five decades after the fact.</p>
<p>Wolff&#8217;s observations should encourage aspiring authors who feel sheepish about their early influences.</p>
<p>But he also offered encouragement to writers whose stories or books have run into dead ends. Sometimes, there is a missing ingredient that is just waiting to present itself and help you finish the story. That was the case for one of his most famous short works, "A Bullet In The Brain," about Anders, a self-satisfied book critic who is caught in the middle of a deadly bank robbery.</p>
<p>Wolff, responding to the request of a young student, read that work out loud on Thursday. The story starts out linear and straightforward, and seems to stop dead about halfway through. "But wait, there&#8217;s more," Wolff told the audience at the moment when the story goes from point-by-point to a more associative "dream time" structure.</p>
<p>It took years for the story to find its ending. The bank robbery scenario &#8211; and the doltish language of the robbers, who seem to have learned every one of their bank-robbing moves and speech mannerisms from television crime shows &#8211; was inspired by a friend&#8217;s account of a real-life Wells Fargo bank robbery. Wolff, digging for details, was "deeply disappointed &#8230; From the way my friend described it, it was one clich&#233; after the other."</p>
<p>On reflection, Wolff was glad he wasn&#8217;t at that bank that day. He wondered what would have happened if he was standing in the line, snickering helplessly and making "ironic judgment" about the robbers&#8217; speech and mannerisms. "Anders is modeled on some aspect of my own character."</p>
<p>But this was not enough to complete the story. Wolff "followed it up" by doing some research on the human brain. "Somehow, the completion of the story had to wait until I had the thing that would give it life. It was a long way around the barn."</p>
<p>Joaquin Mayer, a 22-year-old creative writing major and UCSC senior, was honored to introduce Wolff on Thursday night.</p>
<p>"The short story &#8216;Bullet In The Brain&#8217; showed me how to incorporate significant detail and back story," said Mayer, who described the story as a creative writing master class. "The story&#8217;s words and images stuck in my head long after I finished it. I still have the original copy. The edges are disintegrating."&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://literature.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/living-writers-reading-series.html</url><title>Living Writers Series</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2274049b80727046006b54881cff8b90"><name>ultimate-peace</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alums play hard, work toward "Ultimate Peace"</title><summary>Slugs helped inspire the nonprofit Ultimate Peace, which is committed to building bridges of friendship and understanding for youth from different social and cultural backgrounds around the world.</summary><keywords>ultimate, Karlinsky</keywords><start-date>1301904000000</start-date><display-name>Alums work toward "Ultimate Peace"</display-name><path>/2011/04/ultimate-peace</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/04/ultimate-peace</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1301953119285</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenm</last-modified-by><last-modified>1301960821116</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Sports</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Cori Houston</name><title></title><phone/><email>chouston@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/04/images/matza-balls-team-2009.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/04/images/matza-balls-team-2009.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>matza-balls-team-2009.jpg</name><display-name>matza-balls-team-2009.jpg</display-name><file-size>23681</file-size><width>300</width><height>180</height></image><image-alt>The Matza Balls team</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/04/images/karlinsky-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/04/images/karlinsky-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>karlinsky-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>karlinsky-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>2765</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Danny Karlinsky</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The Matza Balls.

Slug ultimate players and alumni brothers Danny and Dennis Karlinsky (Danny: modern literature and legal studies '08; Dennis: business econ '95), went to Israel in 2005 on the pilot program trip, playing with the Matza Balls.

<p>My goal for the next few weeks is to review these proposals carefully and to consult closely with academic and administrative leaders and the Academic Senate. The campus must make massive cuts to our core budget, which means that impacts will be widespread. We will evaluate these proposals to understand the effects the cuts will have beyond the units in which they occur.</p>
<p>Chancellor Blumenthal and I anticipate communicating our decisions to principal officers in early May.&#160;</p>
<p>I know from talking with faculty, staff, and students that everyone feels anxious about the impact these budget cuts will have on the campus. I wish I could allay that anxiety, but I, too, lose sleep worrying about the changes that are in store.&#160;</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge that it will be impossible for managers to scale back their spending without laying off employees. Some managers will proceed with layoffs earlier than others to address needs within individual units. Knowing that we will lose talented, dedicated employees is the most unfortunate and painful aspect of this budget crisis.</p>
<p>As you may have heard or read, there has been no progress on the extension of current taxes, as proposed by Governor Brown. This means there is still the possibility that the UC system will see further reductions in funding. I pledge to continue to keep you informed, and I encourage you to consider attending the Staff Advisory Board forum on April 7 or a faculty budget forum to be scheduled for early May. We will also schedule budget meetings with students in early May.&#160;</p>

<p>5 de abril, 2011</p>

<p>Para: La Comunidad de la Universidad</p>
<p>De parte de: Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway</p>
<p>Sobre: Actualizaci&#243;n sobre los recortes presupuestarios</p>

<p>Hemos llegado a un etapa en el proceso de planificaci&#243;n presupuestaria, la semana pasada, cuando los decanos acad&#233;micos y otros principales funcionarios propusieron planes detallados de c&#243;mo se proponen aplicar aproximadamente $19 millones en reducciones de presupuesto para el a&#241;o fiscal que comienza el 1 de julio.</p>

<p>Mi objetivo para las pr&#243;ximas semanas es revisar cuidadosamente estas propuestas y consultar con los l&#237;deres acad&#233;micos y administrativos y el Senado Acad&#233;mico. El campus tiene que hacer recortes masivos en nuestro presupuesto de base, lo que significa que los impactos se generalizar&#225;n. Vamos a evaluar las propuestas para entender los efectos que los recortes tendr&#225;n en las unidades.</p>

<p>Canciller Blumenthal e yo anticipamos comunicar nuestras decisiones a los oficiales principales a principios de mayo.&#160;</p>

<p>S&#233; de hablar con el profesorado, el personal y los estudiantes que cada uno se siente ansioso por el impacto que estos recortes en el presupuesto tendr&#225;n en el campus. Me gustar&#237;a poder aliviar esa ansiedad, pero tambi&#233;n pierdo el sue&#241;o preocup&#225;ndome por los cambios que nos esperan.</p>

<p>Quiero reconocer que ser&#225; imposible para los gerentes reducir sus gastos sin despedir empleados. Algunos gerentes proceder&#225;n con los despidos antes que otros para atender las necesidades dentro de las unidades individuales. Sabiendo que vamos a perder esos empleados talentosos y dedicados es el aspecto m&#225;s lamentable y doloroso de esta crisis presupuestaria.</p>

<p>Como usted habr&#225; o&#237;do o le&#237;do, no hay ning&#250;n avance en la extensi&#243;n de los impuestos corrientes, seg&#250;n lo propuesto por el gobernador Brown. Esto significa que todav&#237;a existe la posibilidad de que el sistema de la UC ver&#225; reducciones adicionales de financiaci&#243;n. Les prometo seguir mantenerlos informados, y les animo a considerar que asistan al foro del Staff Advisory Board el 7 de abril o el foro sobre el presupuesto para el profesorado que ser&#225; programado para principios de mayo. Tambi&#233;n se programar&#225;n reuniones de presupuesto con los estudiantes a principios de mayo.</p>

<br/>
Over the last few years, as the campus community&#160;has worked through its responses to a series of decisions &#8211; some of them&#160;imposed from&#160;outside UCSC, some&#160;internal &#8211; it became clear to me that the&#160;administration&#8217;s approach to demonstrations needed to be reconsidered.&#160;I want&#160;to have the best possible&#160;policy, one that&#160;considers the legitimate interests, rights, and duties of all&#160;segments of our community.&#160;A review&#160;of this sort was not something&#160;that could be done by one person&#160;and, when I was appointed as EVC, I wanted to&#160;discuss issues of&#160;demonstration response with the wider campus community.&#160;Helen Shapiro, Provost of Colleges&#160;Nine&#160;and Ten, has been very involved with these&#160;issues and generously agreed to co&#8209;chair&#160;with me a new group that would look at our practices and policies with&#160;regard&#160;to demonstrations.<br/>
<br/>
This new Demonstration Advisory Group includes&#160;people from across the campus &#8211; a complete list of the members is&#160;<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/04/dag-membership.pdf">available here</a>.&#160;There are&#160;leaders&#160;from student government, other students who have been selected from the general&#160;population, faculty, staff (both union-represented&#160;and non&#8209;represented), and&#160;administrators.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of DAG is first to look at the&#160;practices of our campus when people gather to express their opinion on an issue&#160;&#8211; e.g., a&#160;demonstration.&#160;After&#160;learning&#160;about the current practices and policies, DAG wants to then discuss&#160;the changes would be helpful in&#160;encouraging free speech and exchanges of&#160;opinions while&#160;preserving the welfare of the broader campus community.&#160;In other words, DAG aims at&#160;producing a&#160;better outcome for everyone involved and to improve the life of&#160;our&#160;campus.&#160;Other issues we will&#160;consider include campus&#160;surveillance policies, the student judicial process,&#160;and police review.<br/>
<br/>
The goal of DAG is to recommend policy changes to&#160;me, so that I may then ask for opinions and feedback from the wider campus &#8211;&#160;the Academic&#160;Senate, our&#160;students, staff, and other administrators.&#160;This is clearly not going to be a&#160;quick process, but it is a necessary one.<br/>
<br/>
What is your role in this?&#160;&#160;We would appreciate ideas and&#160;suggestions you have on these issues &#8211; please feel free to contact anyone&#160;serving&#160;on DAG to give your&#160;thoughts.&#160;&#160;We want your input as we discuss these important issues.<br/>

<p>6 de Abril, 2011</p>
<p>Para: La Comunidad de la Universidad<br/>
De parte de: Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway<br/>
Subjeto: Consejo Consultivo sobre Manifestaciones</p>
<p>Preboste Helen Shapiro y yo nos complace anunciar la formaci&#243;n de un Grupo Consultivo sobre Manifestactiones (DAG) para la Universidad. Queremos aprovechar esta oportunidad para ofrecerles informaci&#243;n sobre el prop&#243;sito del grupo, sus objetivos y sus miembros.<br/>
<br/>
En los &#250;ltimos a&#241;os, como la comunidad universitaria ha trabajado a trav&#233;s de sus respuestas a una serie de decisiones--algunas de ellas impuestas desde el exterior de la Universidad, algunos internos--se me convirti&#243; en claro que el enfoque de la administraci&#243;n a manifestaciones debe reconsiderarse. Quiero tener la mejor pol&#237;za posible, que considera los intereses leg&#237;timos, derechos y deberes de todos los sectores de nuestra comunidad. Una revisi&#243;n de este tipo no es algo que una sola persona puede hacer y, cuando fui nombrada como EVC, quer&#237;a discutir temas de respuesta a las manifestaciones con la comunidad universitaria en general. Helen Shapiro, Preboste de los Colegios Nueve y Diez, ha estado muy involucrada en estas cuestiones y generosamente acept&#243; convenir conmigo un nuevo grupo que examine nuestras pr&#225;cticas y pol&#237;zas con respeto a las manifestaciones.<br/>
<br/>
Este nuevo Consejo Consultivo sobre Manifestaciones incluye personas de todo el campus, una lista completa de los miembros <a href="dag-membership.pdf">est&#225; disponible aqu&#237;</a>. Hay l&#237;deres de gobierno estudiantil, otros estudiantes que han sido seleccionados entre la poblaci&#243;n general, la Facultad, el personal (tanto representados por sindicato y no representados) y los administradores.<br/>
<br/>
El prop&#243;sito primero de DAG es examinar las pr&#225;cticas de nuestro campus cuando la gente se re&#250;nen para expresar su opini&#243;n sobre una cuesti&#243;n: por ejemplo, una manifestacion. Despu&#233;s de enterarse de las pol&#237;zas y pr&#225;cticas actuales, DAG quiere discutir los cambios que ser&#237;an lo mas &#250;tiles en el fomento de la libertad de expresi&#243;n y el intercambio de opiniones conservando el bienestar de la comunidad universitaria en general. En otras palabras, DAG aspira a producir un resultado mejor para todos los involucrados y para mejorar la vida de nuestra&#160; universidad. Otros temas que consideramos son pol&#237;zas de vigilancia del campus, el proceso judicial de estudiante y revisi&#243;n de la policia.</p>
<p>El objetivo de DAG es recomendar cambios de pol&#237;za para m&#237;, para que yo ruego opiniones y comentarios del campus m&#225;s amplio: el Senado Acad&#233;mico, nuestros estudiantes, personal, y otros administradores. Esto claramente no va a ser un proceso r&#225;pido, pero es necesario.<br/>
<br/>
&#191;Cu&#225;l es su papel en esto? Le agradecer&#237;amos ideas y sugerencias que tiene sobre estos temas: por favor, si&#233;ntase libre de ponerse en contacto con alguien en el DAG para dar su opini&#243;n. Queremos su entrada al debatir estas cuestiones importantes.</p>
<p>Muchas gracias,<br/>

<br/>
As a first-time director, he received the best "Directing, U.S. Drama" award at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival for his debut feature film <em>Sin Nombre</em>.</p>
<p>Fukunaga-who graduated from UCSC in 1999 with a B.A. in history--wrote and directed <em>Sin Nombre</em>, based on his own firsthand experiences with Central American immigrants seeking a better life in the U.S.</p>
<p>Two years later, he has followed that auspicious beginning with <em>Jane Eyre</em>, Fukunaga&#8217;s own take on the classic 1847 novel by Charlotte Bronte&#8212;a book that has already been adapted to the silver screen at least a dozen times before.</p>
<p>The new film--starring Australian actress Mia Wasikowska (Tim Burton&#8217;s <em>Alice in Wonderland, The Kids Are Alright</em>) and Irish actor Michael Fassbender (Quentin Tarantino&#8217;s <em>Inglourious Basterds</em>, HBO&#8217;s <em>Band of Brothers</em>)&#8212;has been creating quite a buzz in the film world.</p>
<p>Below is just a sampling of the reviews Fukunaga&#8217;s latest film has generated in the past few weeks:</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;Cary Joji Fukunaga has reanimated a classic for a new generation, letting <em>Jane Eyre</em> resonate with terror and tenderness.&#8221; --Peter Travers, <strong>Rolling Stone</strong>, (March 2011)<br/>
<br/>
&#8226; &#8220;A splendid example of how to tackle the daunting duty of turning a beloved work of classic literature into a movie.&#8221;&#160; --A.O. Scott, <strong>New York Times</strong>, (March 2011)<br/>
<br/>
&#8226; &#8220;Cary Joji Fukunaga has very likely surpassed all previous cinematic versions of <em>Jane Eyre</em>." &#8211;Andrew O&#8217;Hehir, <strong>Salon.com</strong> (March 2011)<br/>
<br/>
&#8226; &#8220;Using Bront&#235;'s text as the basis for an inquiry into free will versus servitude, Fukunaga mounts a subtly shaded, yet emotionally devastating, examination of what it really means to choose one's own way.&#8221;&#160; --Karina Longworth, <strong>Village Voice</strong>, (March 2011)<br/>
<br/>
&#8226; &#8220;Fukunaga&#8217;s film is exquisitely emotionally calibrated to call forth a single beautiful flower of love out of the cold gray hard ground of 19th century England.&#8221; --Wallace Baine, <strong>Santa Cruz Sentinel</strong> (March 2011).<br/>

<p>On Friday, May 13, UCSC Wellness brings a mini-vacation to all staff, faculty, and students with the Carnival Cruz and the Prediction Walk/Run.</p>
<p>The 2nd Annual <a href="http://wellness.ucsc.edu/index.php/carnival-cruz.html">Carnival Cruz</a> is a free event that will take place from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. on the OPERS East Field. Participants can enjoy free healthy snacks and nutrition demos, race through the inflatable obstacle course, give acupressure a whirl, put on temporary tattoos, play a game of giant Twister, climb up the rock wall, and much more. There will also be a real live goat for everyone to hug! The first 250 people to arrive will receive a free tote bag. No advanced registration is required.</p>
<p>The 22nd <a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22C2W8ZNA2X/">Prediction Walk/Run</a> is another free event that will take place during Carnival Cruz, with the staff/faculty heat starting at 11:30 a.m. and the student heat starting at 1:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: each person on a team of four predicts his/her time to run or walk a distance of half a mile. The captain of the team then adds those predictions together to calculate how long, in minutes and seconds, the team will need to complete two miles (four half-mile mile laps). During the relay, one person from the team will hand the team's baton on to the next person.</p>
<p>Participants do not have to run or walk fast to win the event, since the closest actual time to the predicted time wins. Costumes are encouraged (though not required), and prizes will be given to the top three teams, in addition to the "best-dressed" team and the team with the most creative baton. No watches or timing devices allowed. All participants receive a stainless steel water bottle, not to mention the benefits of exercise and fresh air. Teams must register in advance, and participation is limited to the first 60 teams (per heat) that register.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="31b34fb080727046006b5488186dfbb2"><name>awareness</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month</title><summary>In an ongoing effort to promote a safe, healthy campus environment, we are writing to remind you that April is National Sexual Assault Awareness Month. </summary><keywords>sexual assault awareness</keywords><start-date>1302163200000</start-date><display-name>April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month</display-name><path>/2011/04/awareness</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/04/awareness</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1302208925482</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1302209010949</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff:</p>
<p>In an ongoing effort to promote a safe, healthy campus environment, we are writing to remind you that April is National Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Along with colleges and universities throughout the country, UCSC is taking part in the designated month to reduce the incidence of gender-based violence, including sexual assault, domestic and dating violence, and stalking.</p>
<p>Every member of the community can stand up against sexual violence. Sexual assault is an unfortunate reality on college campuses and affects us all in some way. According to national statistics from the National Institute of Justice and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in six American women and one in 33 American men have experienced rape or attempted rape, and most survivors do not tell anyone about the assault or report to the police.</p>
<p>We strive to make our campus a safe place by bolstering victim assistance services, supporting and advocating for survivors, and enhancing education and prevention programs. In recognition of Sexual Assault Awareness Month, the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/healthcenter/shop/sadv/index.shtml">Student Health Outreach and Promotion</a> (SHOP) office and Women&#8217;s Center are hosting a month-long series of programs to raise awareness about sexual assault and prevention.</p>
<ul>
<li>April 1-30, UCSC Fact Walk: Awareness campaign to educate the campus community about sexual assault.</li>
<li>April 11-27, SHOP Outreach: Increase visibility of campus resources and opportunities to get students involved in ending sexual violence.</li>
<li>April 27, National Denim Day: Wear denim as a visible sign in support of ending sexual assault.</li>
<li>April 29, Take Back the Night: March and rally against rape and other forms of sexual violence.</li>
</ul>
Sexual violence impacts out entire community. Join us in taking a stand and learn more about available resources and campus efforts to end sexual violence. Find out how to get involved and show your support during <a href="http://studentaffairs.ucsc.edu/enough/">Enough is Enough week</a>, from April 4-8, and say &#8220;no&#8221; to violence on our campus.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal and Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Felicia McGinty</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="31bb1d7780727046006b5488f8deb8f9"><name>memoriam-robles</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Celebration of Sophía G.

<br/>
The award recognizes outstanding University of California professors in the humanities or social sciences for research and activities since retirement. Established in 1983, it is named for Constantine Panunzio, a sociology professor at UCLA, who is known as the architect of the UC Retirement System. It includes a $5,000 prize.<br/>
<br/>
Aronson, 79, the eminent social psychologist who retired in 1994, is the fifth UCSC professor to win and the third in consecutive years. Previous UC Santa Cruz winners are Hayden White, History of Consciousness, 2001; G. William Domhoff, sociology, 2007; Thomas Pettigrew, psychology, 2009; and Harry Berger Jr., literature, 2010.&#160; Only UCLA with six winners has more.<br/>
<br/>
Also winning for the 2010-11 academic year is J. Hillis Miller, distinguished professor of literature emeritus at UC Irvine.<br/>
<br/>
"The Panunzio Award is a great idea," Aronson said, "to recognize people for the work they have done after they retire; that is, after they stop working, officially!<br/>
&#160;<br/>
"It is a great honor to have been selected.&#160; For me, doing research on social psychological issues is not work--but a great joy.&#160; So, in a sense, I am being rewarded for having fun!&#160; Not bad."<br/>
<br/>
The UC Santa Cruz Emeriti Association nominated Aronson in recognition of his extensive teaching, research, and writing since retirement. Over the past 17 years, Aronson has published numerous articles and books, including the critically acclaimed <em>Not by Chance Alone, My Life as a Social Psychologist</em> (Basic Books, 2010) and <em>Mistakes Were Made (but not by me)</em> (Harcourt, 2007) with co-author Carol Tavris. He also wrote a children's book, <em>The Adventures of Ruthie and a Little Boy Named Grandpa</em>, with his then six-year-old granddaughter Ruth Aronson.<br/>
<br/>
UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal praised Aronson's selection, calling his work "brilliant, both before and after retirement." Blumenthal said he has long considered <em>Mistakes Were Made</em> <em>(but not by me)</em> "a handbook for chancellors."<br/>
<br/>
The Panunzio is the latest in a long list of accolades awarded Aronson. He received a lifetime achievement award from the Association for Psychological Science and was named one of the 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century in a study published in the <em>Review of General Psychology</em>.<br/>
<br/>
He won the first distinguished teaching award bestowed by the UC Santa Cruz Alumni Association.<br/>
<br/>
His contributions to the field of human behavior have explored the theory of cognitive dissonance and the causes of interpersonal attraction. His research always addressed important social problems, including prejudice reduction, energy conservation, and AIDS prevention. His textbook, <em>The Social Animal,</em> first published in 1972 and now in its 10<sup>th</sup> edition, remains among the most popular texts in social psychology.<br/>
<br/>
UCSC Emeriti Association president John Marcum wrote in the nomination letter that Aronson's scholarly work post-retirement "would be remarkable" for a sighted person; "for someone coping with the loss of his sight, it is hard to find a way to describe Elliot's success."<br/>
<br/>
Aronson has progressively lost his sight from macular degeneration. He continues to write and correspond using voice recognition software and recently acquired a guide dog, a yellow Labrador retriever named "Desilu."<br/>
<br/>
Aronson received his B.A. from Brandeis University in 1954, his M.A. from Wesleyan University in 1956, and his Ph.D. in psychology from Stanford University in 1959. He began teaching at Harvard University in 1959 and moved in 1962 to the University of Minnesota. He joined the University of Texas in 1965 and came to UCSC in 1974. After retirement he continued to teach for several years at UCSC and Stanford University.<br/>

<p>The spring-quarter Staff Advisory Board forum, which drew 150 people to the Stevenson Event Center on April 7, was a chance for Blumenthal and Campus Provost Alison Galloway to answer questions and address concerns about budget impacts.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a tragedy because people are the heart of UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Blumenthal said of an unknown number of layoffs on campus that will occur during the spring quarter.</p>
<p>UCSC&#8217;s share of an estimated half-billion-dollar University of California systemwide reduction in state support is estimated at $31 million. However, the actual amount that must be cut will be closer to $19 million because of prudent financial actions that the campus took last year, Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>Still, the impact will be drastic, he acknowledged. &#160;Final decisions about staffing cuts and other budget reductions are expected to be made in May.</p>
<p>The campus is closely monitoring the progress of discussions &#8212; now stalled &#8212; that would extend a temporary increase in income, vehicle and sales taxes to offset budget cuts. Without that extension, the systemwide cuts could be much higher. Blumenthal mentioned the possibility of another half-billion-dollar cut to the entire UC system, and an additional $31 million cut to UCSC if the measure does not pass.</p>
<p>Blumenthal said that it would be impossible to make such a cut and maintain educational quality. "I simply don't know how we could serve our students with a cut of that magnitude."</p>
<p>Several audience members asked about various ways to raise resources in the face of budget cuts.&#160;Blumenthal mentioned the possibility of UCSC increasing the number of students who pay out-of-state-tuition.&#160;He also focused on the importance of private fundraising, continuing to court federal research funds, and implementing a long-term vision for UCSC that is less reliant on state support.</p>
<p>&#8220;So when will we go back to the good old days?&#8221; Blumenthal said. &#8220;It will probably be a while.&#8221;</p>

<br/>
The event is free and open to the public and runs from 12:30-2 p.m. in the Cervantes Room at the Bay Tree Book Store building.<br/>
<br/>
Rodriquez is a member of the renowned TV Serrana television project that has helped rural Cubans in the Sierra Maestra mountains produce nearly 500 documentaries since 1993. The project will visit 13 universities in 12 cities, in its first tour of the United States.<br/>
<br/>
"Part of idea is to show people a vision of Cuba they've never seen before," said Alexandra Halkin, who will accompany Rodriguez on the tour. Halkin is a documentary filmmaker and founding director of the Americas Media Initiative-Cuba Media Project, a new initiative to distribute Cuban independent and community videos in the U.S.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Halkin said 21 documentaries have been translated for American audiences. The documentaries are all produced by families describing their lives in the Sierra Maestra.<br/>
<br/>
"There's a wide range of subject matter," Halkin said. The 15- to 20-minute documentaries are "about their culture, lives, problems.&#160; It's to educate people in the U.S. that Cuba is a diverse country. It's not just Havana," she said.<br/>
<br/>
TV Serrano was founded with funding from UNESCO, the Cuban government, and the National Association of Small Farmers.<br/>
<br/>
The visit to UC Santa Cruz is sponsored by Latin American and Latino Studies, El Centro (Chicano Latino Resource Center), and Film and Digital Media.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://americasmediainitiative.org/</url><title>Americas Media Initiative</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.tvserrana.icrt.cu/</url><title>TV Serrana</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5t255iz1AA</url><title>TV Serrana on YouTube</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3712d5de80727046006b54882d6169db"><name>atlas</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New atlas takes a graphic approach to global inequalities </title><summary>In 2001, the UC Atlas of Global Inequality went online at UC Santa Cruz.

The site uses downloadable maps and graphics allowing students to explore and research various inequalities around the world.&#160;</p>
<p>Now, millions of hits later, the ideas behind interactive research project have been turned into a book by two UC Santa Cruz professors, <em>The Atlas of Global Inequalities</em>, (University of California, Press, 2011).<br/>
<br/>
In true UCSC fashion, the Atlas is an interdisciplinary effort and one that involves undergraduates throughout.&#160; Although Professor of Sociology Ben Crow and Professor of Computer Science Suresh K. Lodha assembled the Altas and saw it through to eventual publication, they'll be the first to tell you that much of the research work was performed by a distinguished crew of students from two of Crow's classes "World Society" and "Exploring Global Inequalities."<br/>
<br/>
Crow explained that despite the web site's popularity it was difficult to sustain.&#160; UC Press expressed interest in an electronic atlas. From those conversations emerged a plan with Myriad Editions, a book packager in the United Kingdom that publishes a line of atlases such as the Atlas of Migration, Atlas of Human Rights, and Atlas of Climate Change.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The Atlas of Global Inequalities</em> looks at economic, gender, power, health, access, educational, and environmental inequalities. Most are presented in colorful two-page "spreads" that illustrate the material in easy-to-comprehend charts, graphics, and diagrams.<br/>
<br/>
"It's difficult work," Crow said, "to try to translate academic research into popular accessible ideas."<br/>
<br/>
Data must be "distilled into something understandable," said Lodha, describing the process as "visualization of information."<br/>
<br/>
"There is a tendency for the hard sciences to take a common sense approach to social issues," Lodha said, but in this case he found a deeper engagement in the material through the process of putting together the book. "It is pretty powerful."<br/>
<br/>
One of the dozen or so researchers who dug up the data and distilled it is Jasmine Lopez, a third-year biology major from San Diego. She said she took Crow's class as part of her GE requirements, got involved with the project, and now plans to minor in sociology.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm surprised I would enjoy it as much," Lopez said. She contributed spreads on disease, such as HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis; also government action and distribution of wealth.<br/>
<br/>
Taralyn Kawata, a third-year sociology major from Sacramento, researched sections on labor migration, particularly internal migration in China, also freedom and democracy, two concepts, as she points out, that can be measured in different ways.<br/>
<br/>
The book is both a product and a process, Crow said, "a case study of project-based learning."<br/>
<br/>
He also noted, "It showed me Santa Cruz has the best undergraduates, they are fabulous."<br/>

In recognition of the center's efforts, the <em>Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal</em> has named CenSEPS a finalist for the 2011 Energy Award in the category of "Best Conservation Leader (government/nonprofit)."<br/>
<br/>
Based in the Baskin School of Engineering, CenSEPS is exploring the societal implications of new renewable-energy technologies, promoting the use of these technologies to create sustainable communities, and preparing a new generation of engineers and scientists to address the need for increased energy efficiency and reduced carbon footprints.<br/>
<br/>
"We have a lot of projects under way, developing education programs and working with the City of Santa Cruz and other partners on renewable energy projects. We're looking at what can be done on a local scale to develop renewable energy in a practical way," said Michael Isaacson, CenSEPS co-director and Narinder Singh Kapany professor of electrical engineering. <br/>
<br/>
CenSEPS and the other finalists for the 2011 Energy Awards will be honored at an awards ceremony on Tuesday, May 3, at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View. <br/>
<br/>
CenSEPS projects include the Santa Cruz Coastal Renewable Energy Project, which is exploring the potential for solar-, wind-, and wave-energy technologies to make the Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf self-sustaining. UCSC faculty and students led by John Vesecky, professor of electrical engineering, have created a sensor system that measures available energy in the sunlight, wind, and tidal fluctuations at the wharf. Researchers are compiling and analyzing data from the sensors to guide the design of a renewable-energy system to supply power to the wharf. The group has a conditional permit from the California Coastal Commission to install a small wind turbine on the wharf and monitor it for potential impacts on birds. Students are also surveying businesses on the wharf to find out how amenable they are to monitoring their energy use for energy conservation purposes.<br/>
<br/>
"The wharf project will give us data that policy makers need to deal with regulatory issues. If we can figure out how to do this here in Santa Cruz in a way that is acceptable to the community, then we can use that as a model for other coastal communities," Isaacson said.<br/>
<br/>
Researchers affiliated with CenSEPS have also established a renewable energy microgrid test bed at UCSC's Advanced Studies Laboratories at NASA Ames Research Center. Microgrids are localized networks that may offer a reliable way to integrate intermittent sources of renewable energy into large-scale power distribution systems. The UCSC project, led by associate professor of electrical engineering Joel Kubby, incorporates wind and solar energy generation, an electric vehicle that provides energy storage capacity, and state-of-the-art software for optimization of system operations. It is used both for research on renewable-energy microgrids and as a teaching resource. CenSEPS researchers hope to replicate this microgrid concept at the Hartnell College campus in Salinas and at the Lower Quarry on the UCSC campus, Isaacson said.<br/>
<br/>
On the academic side, the center is creating a new curriculum in the Baskin School of Engineering focused on sustainable energy technology, electric power systems, power electronics, and resource planning. According to studies from the U.S. Department of Energy and other national organizations, a serious need is emerging for more power and energy engineers to replace retiring engineers, modernize the grid, and solve engineering challenges associated with new energy technologies. CenSEPS is developing a teaching environment to produce the next-generation workforce needed to meet the energy and power needs of California and the nation.<br/>
<br/>
Another of the educational programs that CenSEPS is involved in is the California-Denmark Summer Program on Renewable Energy, led by professor of electrical engineering Ali Shakouri, which brings together students and researchers from three UC campuses and leading universities in Denmark. The program, held alternate years in California or Denmark, allows students with various academic backgrounds to interact and work together on final projects that target energy problems from different angles.<br/>
<br/>
"In our academic programs, we try to bring together students from the social sciences and engineering to work on common projects, so they're looking at the social implications of the technology as well as the technology itself. It's important to develop appropriate technology that will be accepted by the community," Isaacson said.<br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4594ead180727046006b5488856dca94"><name>flatte-lecture</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Cosmology and particle physics are focus of public talk on Monday, April 25</title><summary>Princeton University physicist Curtis Callan will give a free public lecture on cosmology and particle physics on Monday, April 25.</summary><keywords>Flatte Lecture, Curtis Callan</keywords><start-date>1302508800000</start-date><display-name>Cosmology and particle physics lecture</display-name><path>/2011/04/flatte-lecture</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/04/flatte-lecture</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1302542477899</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1302542571417</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/04/images/curtis-callan-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/04/images/curtis-callan-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>curtis-callan-250.jpg</name><display-name>curtis-callan-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>54511</file-size><width>250</width><height>356</height></image><image-alt>photo of curtis callan</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/04/images/curtis-callan-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/04/images/curtis-callan-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>curtis-callan-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>curtis-callan-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25055</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Curtis Callan</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Princeton University physicist Curtis Callan will give a free public lecture on cosmology and particle physics on Monday, April 25, at 7 p.m. at the University Inn and Conference Center, 611 Ocean Street, in Santa Cruz. <br/>
<br/>
"What is the world made of? Answers (and questions) from particle physics and cosmology" is the title of Callan's talk, the second annual Stanley Flatt&#233; Memorial Lecture presented by the UC Santa Cruz Department of Physics. <br/>
<br/>
Particle physics probes the smallest distance scales, while cosmology observes the large-scale structure of the universe. Both sciences have made enormous strides in the past 50 years, and each has produced its own nearly complete picture of the world. The origin of our universe in a "Big Bang" ties the two pictures together, and Callan asks whether particle physics and cosmology are telling the same story. They are, he says, but only up to a point. Reconciling their stories will be the central task of fundamental physics for many years to come.<br/>
<br/>
Callan is the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Physics at Princeton University. He works on quantum field theories which underlie the phenomena of particle physics. In recent years, this has led him to study issues in string theory and quantum gravity. His honors include the Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Physics from the American Physical Society, the Dirac Medal of the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, and election to the National Academy of Sciences.

The new program would allow career staff, except members of the Senior Management Group (SMG), to voluntarily reduce their time in order for the University to achieve salary savings.</p>
<p>Subject to department approval, eligible employees could choose to participate in the program for one month or more beginning July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012, and voluntarily reduce pay and hours worked between 5 and 50 percent of full time.</p>
<p>In return for a voluntary reduction in time, participants will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accrue vacation and sick leave credits at their rate accrued prior to participation in ERIT;</li>
<li>Continue their UC health and welfare benefits without changes to premiums or benefits while participating in ERIT;</li>
<li>Have their UC Retirement Plan (UCRP) contributions based on their reduced salary, and UCRP service credit will accrue based on their reduced appointment;</li>
<li>Have other retirement benefits calculated based upon their pre-ERIT compensation rate as outlined within the proposed program guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Represented employee&#8217;s participation in ERIT would be subject to collective bargaining.</p>

The UCSC team mustered a handful of votes, but was summarily dismissed as a serious contender.<br/>

Not only did the entirely student-led team make it out of regionals, it then went on to place in the top six at the Opening Round Championship Series in Irvine in March, and grabbed UCSC a spot in the National Championships to be held April 15-17 in Des Moines, Iowa.</p>

How did still life painters portray the conflict between order, harmony and beauty on the one hand and disorder, damage and death on the other?</p>
<p>Harry Berger, a founding faculty member at UC Santa Cruz,&#160; will focus on this subject during a free Emeriti Faculty Lecture scheduled for 7 p.m., April 21 at the Music Recital Hall.</p>
<p>Berger is famous for his wide-ranging, interdisciplinary approach as a literary and cultural critic. Now in his mid-80s, he hasn&#8217;t slowed down, continuing his regular output of scholarly essays and books.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also known for his irreverent wit; in a poster for the event, Berger promised to explore still life &#8220;through the lens provided by Stephen Colbert&#8217;s idea of &#8216;truthiness,&#8217; while paying special attention to the way still-life painters delight in depicting &#8220;the depredations inflicted by such tiny terrorists as snails and caterpillars.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, the insect damage portrayed in the still life inspired the title of this presentation: &#8220;Caterpillage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The talk will be an opportunity to hear Berger&#8217;s far-ranging, adventurous mind at work.</p>
<p>"Although the breadth of Berger's work is awesome, he doesn't dabble," said David Lee Miller, co-editor of <em>A Touch More Rare: Harry Berger Jr. and the Arts of Interpretation</em>. "When he turns to art history, he challenges and transforms the field's repertoire of methodologies. Whatever his mind touches starts to glow."</p>
<p>Berger came to UC Santa Cruz in 1965 where he taught a variety of subjects under the general category of culture theory and Renaissance culture, including Renaissance drama and Shakespeare.</p>
<p>In art history, he specialized in Italian and Dutch painting and the theory and practice of portraiture. Berger has published extensively over the years, with numerous books and more than 100 articles to his credit. Since his retirement, Berger has written dozens of articles and completed nine books.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/05/3770.html</url><title>A feature on Harry Berger</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="469bbb5180727046006b54883b34a977"><name>pasolini-conference</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Center for Visual and Performance Studies to host conference on Pasolini</title><summary>On April 29-30, the UCSC Arts Division’s center for Visual and Performance Studies (VPS) will host an international conference titled "Pasolini’s Body: New Directions in Pasolini Scholarship" at the Cowell College Conference Room. </summary><keywords>Pasolini, Center for Visual Studies and Performance, Mark Franko, arts, ucsc</keywords><start-date>1302559200000</start-date><display-name>Visual-and-Performance-Studies-pasolini-conference </display-name><path>/2011/04/pasolini-conference</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/04/pasolini-conference</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1302559701745</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1302570210189</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value><value>Theater Arts</value><value>History of Art and Visual Culture</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/04/images/PasoliniPoster-300-finalcrop-.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/04/images/PasoliniPoster-300-finalcrop-.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>PasoliniPoster-300-finalcrop-.jpg</name><display-name>PasoliniPoster-300-finalcrop-.jpg</display-name><file-size>60080</file-size><width>300</width><height>354</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/04/images/Pasolini-t humb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/04/images/Pasolini-t humb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Pasolini-t humb.jpg</name><display-name>Pasolini-t humb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17361</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Pier Paolo Pasolini is best known to American audiences through his films--from&#160;<em>The Passion According to Saint Matthew</em> (1964) and <em>The Hawks and the Sparrows</em>&#160;(1966), to <em>Il Decameron</em>&#160;(1971) and <em>Salo</em>&#160;(1975).<br/>
<br/>
One of the great Italian artistic and intellectual figures of the 20th century, he was also a major Italian poet and an artist of remarkable interdisciplinary range--he was additionally known for his work as a screenwriter, theatre critic, playwright, essayist, journalist, graphic artist, and novelist .<br/>
<br/>
On April 29-30, the UCSC Arts Division&#8217;s Center for Visual and Performance Studies (VPS) will host an international conference titled <em>"</em>Pasolini&#8217;s Body: New Directions in Pasolini Scholarship<em>"</em> at the Cowell College Conference Room. <br/>
<br/>
Coordinated by Director of the Center for Visual and Performance Studies Mark Franko with literature professor Deanna Shemek, the conference will include presentations by scholars from around the world in four different sessions. <br/>
<br/>
There will also be a screening of Pasolini's <em>Arabian Nights</em> on Thursday, April 28 at 7 p.m., and <em>Notes on an African Orestes</em>,&#160;on Friday April 29, at 5:30 p.m. Both films will be shown in Studio C of the Communications Building.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The Center for Visual and Performance Studies has chosen to focus on Pasolini for its upcoming conference because of his wide interdisciplinary range,&#8221; Franko noted. <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Since its inception, VPS has been interested in the way the body mediates between art practices of the visual and the performative,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We believe this approach--Pasolini's body--brings critical discourses of film, dance, literature, social theory, history, gender, and post-coloniality into dialogue.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
The Center for Visual and Performance Studies is a faculty and graduate student research group established in 1996 to bring interdisciplinary activities in the arts, humanities, and social sciences into greater visibility at UCSC. <br/>
<br/>
Today it serves as a collaborative research and programming "think tank" for faculty and graduates from 13 departments. <br/>
&#160;<br/>
VPS is dedicated to the support of graduate students and faculty engaged in research and writing on any area of visual and performance studies, including dance, texts, digital new media, moving image media, and works of art.<br/>
<br/>
This conference is sponsored by the UCSC Arts Division, Arts Research Institute, Istituto Italiano di Cultura di San Francisco, Cowell College, and the Theater Arts, Literature, Film and Digital Media, History of Art and Visual Culture, History of Consciousness, Feminist Studies, and History departments.<br/>

<br/>
The piece will be the central artwork for the embassy and will consist of a large diptych on lightboxes, with images of Niagara and Victoria Falls. &#160;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It is similar to my <em>Average Niagara</em> work that is in the collection of San Francisco&#8217;s de Young Museum,&#8221; Anderson noted.<br/>
<br/>
The work was commissioned by the State Department's Art in Embassies program, and the piece will have a prominent place in the entry atrium of the new US embassy in Lusaka, Zambia.</p>
<p>&#8220;A person associated with the State Department saw my solo exhibition <em>Average Landscapes</em> at the de Young in 2007,&#8221; said Anderson. &#8220;Originally, they contacted me about loaning a piece to them for an embassy in Burkina, West Africa, but on the advice of the de Young curator, I declined lending the piece.&#8221; &#160;<br/>
<br/>
Recently, the Art in Embassies program contacted Anderson again--only this time they were willing to commission a work.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;They wanted a similar piece to the <em>Niagara</em>, but they wanted one image to be Victoria Falls, which is in Zambia,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;This was to illustrate a relationship between the natural wonders of both countries.&#8221; &#160;<br/>
<br/>
The work will be installed there later this year. &#8220;Currently, they are looking for funds to send me there and arranging for me to work with students in Lusaka,&#8221; Anderson noted.<br/>
<br/>
Anderson&#8217;s latest research has been focused on questions about what it means to be a landscape artist in the 21st century, and how an artist represents landscape with contemporary practices and tools.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
He noted that environmentalism is an important aspect to incorporate in representing &#160;21st Century landscapes.<br/>
<br/>
One of his projects involves working with the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition along with DANM grad student Phoenix Toews--developing augmented reality software that runs on iPhones and iPads.<br/>
<br/>
Their work is titled <em>Tour of the Monuments of Silicon Valley</em>. A viewer will be able to run an application on a device and visit a particular Silicon Valley Superfund site--there are currently 29 in the valley.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Their phone locates them at the site and as they look through the camera on the phone, audio about the history and condition of the site plays, and 3D graphics appear in certain locations,&#8221; said Anderson.&#160;&#8220;They can interact with the 3D objects and hear more sound or see other images. And they can follow virtual objects through the space to learn about certain spots on the site.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Anderson said that goal of the project is to create an interactive, locative storytelling platform using the phone, sound, text, and interactive computer graphics.&#160;A prototype was exhibited this past summer at the&#160; <em>01SJ International Biennia</em>l of technology art in San Jose.<br/>
<br/>
Anderson is also taking part in a residency&#160;at SF Camerawork&#160;Gallery titled "As Yet Untitled"&#160;with a collective called &#8220;Nonsite Collective.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It's a group of Bay Area writers and artists,&#8221; said Anderson. &#8220;The residency is also an exhibition--the public witnesses the work done during the residency as it develops.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The piece we're working on now is titled <em>Common/Use</em>--an exploration of the meaning of the commons in the 21st century,&#8221; said Anderson. &#160;&#8220;My segment is 'Common/Waste,' which examines how refuse, environmental contamination, and degradation are part of the commons.&#8221;&#160;<br/>

The new major, leading to a B.S. degree, is the first of its kind in the UC system.</p>
<p>"Robots are used in many industry segments today, including automotive, aerospace, electronics and computers, industrial machinery, telecommunications, medicine, agriculture, mining, and textiles. As technology continues to bring cyber and physical worlds together, the demand for robotics engineers will continue to increase, which makes our new major a much needed addition to the curriculum of the Baskin School of Engineering," said J. J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, Baskin Professor and chair of computer engineering in UCSC's Jack Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>The Department of Computer Engineering will administer the new program. Students can start enrolling in the robotics engineering major in fall 2011. The new degree will prepare students for a wide range of careers in areas of industry that include not only robotics, but also biotechnology, computer hardware, and instrumentation.</p>
<p>Richard Hughey, a professor of computer engineering who was instrumental in developing the robotics program, said he expects it to attract a lot of students. "The students definitely wanted this degree. It's very well suited for undergraduates who like to design and build things. I'm hopeful that it will attract more engineering students to UCSC, like we saw previously with new degrees in bioengineering and computer game design," Hughey said.</p>
<p>The undergraduate degree program complements a graduate minor in robotics and control begun last year by faculty in computer engineering, applied mathematics and statistics, electrical engineering, and technology and information management. The robotics engineering degree will give students a thorough grounding in the theoretical foundations of robotics and control, as well as hands-on experience with robotics platforms and hardware implementation.</p>
<p>"Our approach is very multidisciplinary, so students are prepared to deal with both the theoretical and applied concepts, including hardware and software aspects of the field," said Jacob Rosen, associate professor of computer engineering. "The faculty come from very different backgrounds, which reflects the multidisciplinary nature of the field."</p>
<p>Rosen's research focuses on medical robotics, including surgical robots and robotic exoskeletons with therapeutic applications. Other faculty involved in the robotics engineering program include Gabriel Elkaim and William Dunbar, both associate professors of computer engineering. Elkaim, whose research focuses on autonomous and embedded systems, teaches the highly popular "Introduction to Mechatronics" course, in which teams of students build fully autonomous robots in just 10 weeks and present them in a public competition at the end of the quarter.</p>
<p>"The mechatronics class is a great launching pad for students to prepare them for their capstone design projects," Elkaim said. "We've had an informal robotics and control track, and now that we've formalized it with this new degree, I think it will be a huge draw. It's a very forward-looking degree."</p>
<p>Robotics engineering will be an especially intensive and challenging major, but it will give students valuable training, he said. "There's no question we need more people trained in robotics."</p>
<p>"The robotics engineering degree will prepare students for building anything that has embedded computer chips and sensors," Hughey added. "Whether or not it's a robot, if a problem involves computers interacting with the real world, robotics engineers will be able to design a solution."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4b4a714c80727046006b548830684d30"><name>tajima-pena</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>SocDoc graduate director wins Guggenheim Fellowship</title><summary>Renee Tajima-Peña, graduate director of the masters Social Documentation program at UC Santa Cruz, has been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for 2011.</summary><keywords>uc, ucsc. uc santa cruz, social documentation, renee tajima-pena, mas bebes, guggenheim fellowship, </keywords><start-date>1302595200000</start-date><display-name>Renee Tajima-Peña</display-name><path>/2011/04/tajima-pena</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/04/tajima-pena</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1302638260449</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1303160705623</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Community Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/04/images/tajima-pena-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/04/images/tajima-pena-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tajima-pena-400.jpg</name><display-name>tajima-pena-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>161418</file-size><width>400</width><height>305</height></image><image-alt>Renee Tajima-Peña on a film shoot </image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/04/images/tajima-pena-renee-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/04/images/tajima-pena-renee-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tajima-pena-renee-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>tajima-pena-renee-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22579</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Renee Tajima-Peña</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Renee Tajima-Pe&#241;a, left, during the filming of an interview for her documentary "Mas B&#233;b&#233;s?" currently in production. <br/></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Renee Tajima-Pe&#241;a, graduate director of the masters Social Documentation program at UC Santa Cruz, has been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for 2011.<br/>
<br/>
She is one of 180 scholars, artists, and scientists in 78 fields to win a Guggenheim out of nearly 3,000 applicants.<br/>
<br/>
Tajima-Pe&#241;a, an independent documentary filmmaker as well as professor of community studies, said she plans to use the fellowship to complete work on film and transmedia projects.&#160; One is "Mas B&#233;b&#233;s?," a film she is currently shooting, that documents allegations of coercive sterilizations of Mexican American women at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center in the 1960s and 1970s. The sterilizations were performed as part of family planning programs widespread at the time in the United States and abroad.<br/>
<br/>
Those charges "catalyzed a whole generation of young Chicana activists," Tajima-Pe&#241;a said, and led to a class-action suit brought by eleven of the sterilized mothers. "The case has never been resolved in the minds of the women," she said.<br/>
<br/>
Tajima-Pe&#241;a said her next project will focus on the political and social impact of Asian martial arts around the world during the 1970s. The spread of Asian martial arts, including kung-fu, karate, and judo "influenced a lot of social movements," Tajima-Pe&#241;a said.<br/>
<br/>
She recalls a proliferation of dojos, or training studios, at the time. "Young people were magnetized," said.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest martial arts name of the era, Bruce Lee, was frequently outspoken on racial images on screen and in Hollywood, Tajima-Pe&#241;a remembers. His films often had an underlying anti-colonialist theme, specifically regarding Japanese colonialism.<br/>
<br/>
Tajima-Pe&#241;a was nominated for an Academy Award for the 1987 documentary "Who Killed Vincent Chin" about a Chinese-American draftsman mistaken for Japanese and killed in Detroit during a backlash against Japanese carmakers.<br/>
<br/>
Among her other films are "My America &#8230; or Honk if you Love Buddha," winner of the Eastman Kodak Award at the Sundance Film Festival, and &#8220;Calavera Highway,&#8221; which aired on PBS&#8217;s &#8220;P.O.V.&#8221; series and will be one of the transmedia projects that Tajima-Pe&#241;a plans to work on with the fellowship.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Tajima-Pe&#241;a joined UC Santa Cruz in 2003. She received her B.A. from Radcliffe College, Harvard University.<br/>

The event is free and open to the public.<br/>
<br/>
According to Fletcher, right-wing populism is a phenomenon deeply rooted in the U.S system and tends to emerge during times of economic distress and crisis. He argues it plays on fears and prejudices and is integrally connected to matters of race. Fletcher will address the importance of understanding right-wing populism and the role that a renewed labor movement can play in combating it.<br/>
<br/>
Fletcher is the co-author with Fernando Gapasin of <em>Solidarity Divided, the Crisis in Organized Labor and A New Path Toward Social Justice</em> (UC Press). He was formerly vice president for International Trade Union Development Programs for the George Meany Center of the AFL-CIO. Earlier, he served as education director and later assistant to the AFL-CIO president.<br/>
<br/>
He is an editorial board member and columnist for <a href="http://blackcommentator.com/">BlackCommentator.com</a> and a senior scholar for the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C. He is the immediate past president of TransAfrica Forum and a founder of the Black Radical Congress.<br/>
<br/>
Fletcher began in the labor movement as a rank-and-file member of the Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of America. He was also involved in efforts to desegregate the Boston building trades. He later served in leadership and staff positions in District 65-United Auto Workers, the National Postal Mail Handlers Union, and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).<br/>
<br/>
Fletcher is a graduate of Harvard University, author of numerous articles, and speaks widely on domestic and international topics, racial justice, and labor issues.<br/>

<p>The Maccabiah Games is an international Jewish sporting event similar to the Olympics that is held every four years in Israel.&#160;"Sports is something really easy to relate to and provides a special energy and bond," Erez Shacar, the Israel program director for the Santa Cruz Hillel, which coordinated the day of competition, told the Santa Cruz Sentinel. "Having these games is good because it gives added value to the original games back in Israel and provides students a chance to meet new people."</p>
<p>Shacar expected participants from UCSC, University of San Francisco, Cal, Stanford, UC Davis, Sacramento State, Chico State and Sonoma State.</p>
<p>The games included competition in Frisbee, chess, board games, basketball, volleyball and field events, among other activities.</p>

(Ed) Green, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz. Green, who studies ancient DNA and human evolution, is one of 15 young scientists to receive the prestigious grants this year.</p>
<p>The Searle Scholars Program makes grants to selected universities and research centers to support the independent research of exceptional young faculty in the biomedical sciences and chemistry. The program recognizes scientists who have already demonstrated innovative research with the potential for making significant contributions to biological research over an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Green has helped pioneer the use of advanced sequencing technology to study ancient DNA extracted from fossil bones. As a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, he coordinated the Neanderthal Genome Project. A paper on the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/05/3754.html">Neanderthal genome</a> published in 2010 earned him the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/02/newcomb-cleveland.html">Newcomb Cleveland Prize</a> for the outstanding paper published in the journal <em>Science.</em> A subsequent paper published in December described a previously unknown group of human relatives, called "<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/12/denisovans.html">Denisovans</a>." In addition to the Neanderthal genome and ancient DNA, Green's research interests include human evolutionary genetics and the regulation of gene expression.</p>
<p>"It's a great honor to receive this award, and it will be a big help in getting my research program off the ground," Green said. "I know how selective the Searle Scholars Program is, so I'm ecstatic to be selected."</p>
<p>Green earned a B.S. in genetics at the University of Georgia, Athens, and a Ph.D. in molecular and cell biology, with an emphasis in computational and genomic biology, at UC Berkeley. He joined the faculty of the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz in January 2010. He was awarded a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/02/green-sloan.html">Sloan Research Fellowship</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.searlescholars.net/">Searle Scholars Program</a> is funded from the estates of Mr. and Mrs. John G. Searle. Mr. Searle was the president and grandson of the founder of the pharmaceutical company G.D. Searle &amp; Company. It was Mr. Searle's wish that certain funds be used to support research in medicine, chemistry, and biological science.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="50c4372180727046006b5488d85640a8"><name>carnival-cruz-predictionwalk</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Carnival Cruz and Prediction Walk/Run</title><summary>On Friday, May 13, UCSC Wellness brings a mini-vacation to all students, staff, and faculty via Carnival Cruz and the Prediction Walk/Run. </summary><keywords>Carnival Cruz, Prediction Walk/Run</keywords><start-date>1302681600000</start-date><display-name>Carnival Cruz and Prediction Walk</display-name><path>/2011/04/carnival-cruz-predictionwalk</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/04/carnival-cruz-predictionwalk</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1302730127026</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1302730127026</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>This is one Friday the 13th you won't want to avoid!&#160; On Friday, May 13, UCSC Wellness brings a mini-vacation to all students, staff, and faculty via Carnival Cruz and the Prediction Walk/Run. <br/>
<br/>
The 2nd Annual Carnival Cruz is a free event that will take place from 11:30am-2:30pm on the OPERS East Field.&#160; Participants can enjoy free healthy snacks and nutrition demos, race through the inflatable obstacle course, give acupressure a whirl, put on temporary tattoos, play a game of giant Twister, climb up the rock wall, and much, much more.&#160; There will also be a real live goat for everyone to hug!&#160; The first 250 people to arrive will receive a free tote bag.&#160; No advanced registration is required-- just show up! <br/>
<br/>
The 22nd Annual Prediction Walk/Run is another free event that will take place during Carnival Cruz, with the staff/faculty/retiree heat starting at 11:30 am, and the student heat starting at 1:30pm.&#160; Here's how it works:&#160; each person on a team of four predicts his/her time to run or walk a distance of 1/2 mile.&#160; The captain of the team then adds those predictions together to calculate how long, in minutes and seconds, the team will need to complete 2 miles (four 1/2 mile laps).&#160; During the relay, one person from the team will hand the team's baton on to the next person. Participants do not have to run or walk fast to win the event, since the closest actual time to the predicted time wins!&#160; Costumes are encouraged (although not required), and prizes will be given to the top three teams, in addition to the "best-dressed" team and the team with the most creative baton. No watches or timing devices allowed!&#160; All participants receive a stainless steel water bottle, not to mention the benefits of exercise and fresh air. Teams must register in advance, and participation is limited to the first 60 teams per heat that register. <br/>

<p>The peregrine falcons nesting atop San Jose City Hall have successfully hatched four eggs this year in a nest box provided for them by the UC Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group (SCPBRG). As it has since 2007, the SCPBRG's falcon <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/scpbrg/nestcameras.htm">nest camera</a> provides year-round live streaming video of the activities at the nest, including the laying of the first eggs in February, the rearing of the chicks, and the first flights of the fledglings in May. Another SCPBRG nest cam monitors a nest box on the PG&amp;E headquarters building in San Francisco, where three nestlings hatched this year.</p>
<p>"Thanks to the nest cameras, people get excited about falcons and nature, including community members and UCSC students," said SCPBRG director Glenn Stewart. "Peregrine falcon-watching is now an important leisure activity for many Bay Area residents who assist with my research by reporting sightings of the falcons I band at half a dozen nests each year."</p>
<p>Stewart will determine the sex of the chicks when he bands them on April 28. In San Jose, this task involves using climbing gear to rappel down from the roof of City Hall to the nest box on an 18th-story ledge of the building. The City of San Jose is inviting youths ages 5 to 18 to suggest names for the birds. Details about the contest are available <a href="http://www.sanjoseca.gov/falcons">online</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2009/06/3009.html">Fledge watch</a> volunteers in both San Jose and San Francisco will help Stewart monitor the fledglings during their perilous first flights. Stewart's partners in San Jose include the City of San Jose and the <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/sanjosefalcons">San Jose Peregrine Falcon Alliance</a>, a citizen's group committed to support of the SCPBRG educational mission centered on the recovery of the peregrine falcon population. PG&amp;E also helps underwrite SCPBRG's conservation education programs, including presentations to school assemblies throughout Central and Northern California.</p>
<p>Established at UCSC in 1975, the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group was instrumental in the recovery of the peregrine falcon population, which was in danger of extinction in the 1970s due to the effects of the pesticide DDT. During the population recovery effort, SCPBRG scientists released more than 1,000 captive-raised peregrine falcons into the wild. Stewart estimates there are now more than 250 nesting pairs in California. The peregrine falcon was removed from the federal endangered species list in 1999 and from the state endangered species list in 2008.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="55747d6e80727046006b54888a65ccdb"><name>more-zipcars</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>More Zipcars in the Santa Cruz Community </title><summary>Based on the success of the Zipcar program both on campus and in the Santa Cruz community, I am pleased to announce that three additional Zipcars are now available in Santa Cruz for use by all UCSC students, staff and faculty.</summary><keywords>zipcar</keywords><start-date>1302768000000</start-date><display-name>More Zipcars in Santa Cruz</display-name><path>/2011/04/more-zipcars</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/04/more-zipcars</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1302808788226</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1302808788226</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Based on the success of the Zipcar program both on campus and in the Santa Cruz community, I am pleased to announce that three additional Zipcars are now available in Santa Cruz for use by all UCSC students, staff and faculty. Whether you live on campus or in town, you do not need to own your own car&#8212;consider car sharing instead. Reduce your expenses, lower your carbon footprint, yet still have "wheels when you want them." <br/>
<br/>
One additional vehicle will be added to the Olive Street pod (at Mission near the CVS Pharmacy) and a new pod of two cars is located on Soquel Avenue in front of the Whole Foods shopping area. <br/>
<br/>
These three new vehicles augment the eight cars located on campus at the East Field House, Upper College Eight, Heller/McLaughlin intersection, and at College Nine/Ten. In addition, five more Zipcars are available in and around downtown Santa Cruz: at the Cathcart/Cedar Street parking lot, the Walnut Tree parking lot (on Cedar between Union and Center Street), and on Laurel Street near Blackburn. <br/>
<br/>
To join Zipcar or for more information please go to www.zipcar.com/ucsc&#160; or call Teresa Buika, TAPS, at 831-502-7941. <br/>
<br/>
Please continue to help UCSC lead the way in reducing transportation impacts throughout the Santa Cruz community.

<p>Instead, they've organized an entire <a href="http://eight.ucsc.edu/earth-week.html">Earth Week</a>, which kicks off on Friday, April 15, and continues through Earth Day itself--Friday, April 22. This year's theme is "Celebrating Sustainable Community, Culture and the Place We Live."</p>
<p>Earth Week is part carnival, part art fair, and part brainstorming session. Activities are free and open to the public.</p>
<p>The week will feature everything from a serious discussion about the Japanese nuclear disaster to a sunset walk, a stargazing workshop, a hike to hidden spots on campus, an outdoor movie screening, and an art workshop featuring recyclable materials. There will be a strong emphasis on DIY and hands-on activities as well as hikes and lectures.</p>
<p>Here are just a few of the featured activities that will be held on and off campus. (for a full list of all Earth Week activities, go to the official Earth Week website.)</p>
<p><strong>Climb a wall:</strong> Friday, April 15 from noon to 4 p.m. The Earth Week kick-off event, held at the UCSC Quarry Plaza, features farm-fresh produce at the Program in Community and Agroecology's market cart, free climbing on a climbing wall, and a special "hydration station" showing the benefits of reusable water bottles. The display also encourages people not to use single-use disposable water bottles.</p>
<p><strong>Clean a lagoon:</strong> Saturday, April 16. A clean-up at Younger Lagoon will take place between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., involving the Campus Stewardship Program and the Campus Natural Reserve. Volunteers will plant various native species after meeting at the Seymour Discovery Center whale skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>Celebrate with Santa Cruz</strong>: Saturday, April 16. A community Earth Day celebration will be held from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at San Lorenzo Park in Santa Cruz, with help from the City of Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz County, Ecology Action, Save Our Shores, and other groups of local nonprofits and concerned citizens. The event will feature a river clean-up.</p>
<p><strong>Hike to a secret spot:</strong> Saturday, April 16: Hikers will light out from the Stevenson Knoll above East Field at 1 p.m. and explore some of the campus's legendary hidden and natural locations. The hiking and exploring last until 5 p.m. Bring water and snacks. The guides promise places "you can really sink your toes into."</p>
<p><strong>Head to the fair:</strong> Saturday, April 16. College Eight and Oakes College have teamed up to present an Earth Fest&#8211;Sustainability Fair from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. at College Eight Plaza, featuring sustainable foods and activities.</p>
<p><strong>Learning from tragedy:</strong> Tuesday, April 19. UCSC nuclear policy lecturer Daniel Hirsch will present a lecture on the recent nuclear tragedy in Japan from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. at the Stevenson College Event Center.</p>
<p><strong>Talk about the future</strong>: Thursday, April 21. The artist/author/social and environmental justice advocate Osprey Oriel Lake will lead a discussion called "Where Are We Going: Environmental and Cultural Sustenance for our Times," at 7 p.m at the Oakes Learning Center.</p>
<p><strong>Join a summit on sustainability</strong>: The 10th annual Campus Earth Summit begins at 9:30 a.m. Friday at the College Nine and Ten multipurpose room. The Earth Summit's keynote speakers are Fred Keeley, past state assemblymember and current treasurer of Santa Cruz County, and Matthew St. Clair, sustainability manager for the UC Office of the President.</p>
<p><strong>Student&#160; groundswell</strong></p>
<p>As shown by this comprehensive activities list, this is the most intensive set of UCSC Earth Day celebrations ever.</p>
<p>While the emphasis is on celebration and fun, there is a pragmatic aspect to the events; many activities are meant to be jumping-off points for students who want to undertake their own green-friendly projects, get funding for their programs, and engage with other user groups.</p>
<p>The UCSC community has united behind each of these events, with staff and faculty helping out at each event. But Earth Week is the result of a strong student vision that has been taking shape on campus in recent years.</p>
<p>"There is a collective capacity to make good things happen here," said Michael Kittredge, the College Eight programs coordinator. "And there are so many folks, from so many aspects of life at UCSC, that have a hand in this: the dining staff, programs offices, faculty and staff--they are all connecting back to our community."</p>
<p>Kittredge and Chancellor's Undergraduate Internship Program intern Tyler Jessen organized a number of Earth Week activities that center around College Eight this year and reached out to other stakeholders on campus.</p>
<p>The two of them coordinated this year's Earth Week website, the outreach campaign, the logo, and the keynote speaker event.</p>
<p>"This is a perfect example of what I like to call grassroots organizing," Kittredge said. "We started meeting with other campus groups and organizations in January, from OPERS to the Farm to the resource centers. We started throwing out an idea that grew out of a student project a number of years ago; wouldn't it be great if we had a UCSC Earth Week?"</p>
<p>But why would UCSC need such a high-profile "green" event, on a campus that is starting to draw national recognition for "green" building and a food service program that has helped UCSC win recognition from the Sierra Club and other organizations?</p>
<p>Kittredge explained that there is plenty of room for UCSC to grow its green practices and increase community awareness. "While there is definitely a culture that exists at UCSC around sustainability work, we are still the size of a small town, with15,000 students and 2,500 employees. While there is a sustainable culture here, not all students know about these opportunities." Earth Week, he said, is a great way for the broader population to get its feet wet and become more involved.</p>
<p>Planting seeds of sustainability</p>
<p>Another major shareholder in this year's Earth Week activities is the Student Environmental Center, which organized the Campus Earth Summit, one of the week's cornerstone events.</p>
<p>"I am so inspired to see how Earth Week has grown from a few students to a campus-wide collaborative effort," said Gabi Kirk, a Kresge College junior who is majoring in environmental studies and history. Kirk is co-chair of the Student Environmental Center, the influential student organization that is hosting and organizing the summit.</p>
<p>The all-day, student-run summit will bring together students, staff, faculty, and community members to prioritize green-minded and sustainable projects on campus. The summit, which takes place at the Colleges Nine and Ten multipurpose room, begins at 9:30 a.m. and wraps up at 2 p.m. on Earth Day.</p>
<p>This event is a brainstorming session and an intensive dialogue aimed at helping the campus on its path toward sustainability. Attendees will hear updates on UCSC's Campus Sustainabilty Plan, and will contribute ideas to a non-binding, informational "blueprint" for a sustainable campus.</p>
<p>"These discussions are geared to get as many ideas on the table as possible," said Tyler Pitts, a staff member who is working with the Student Organization Advising &amp; Resources [SOAR] on the Earth Summit event.</p>
<p>Pitts also works with the Student Environmental Center and the Education for Sustainable Living Program as an advisor. Pitts said the campus has made strides in recent years, "but a lot of people have great ideas and don't realize there are places to go to get funding for their projects on campus."</p>
<p>Earth Week will also include a special visit and discussion with a group of visiting Hawaiian academics and food growers, who want to learn from UCSC's green practices and hope to incorporate some of them back home.</p>
<p>UCSC's&#160;&#160;Division of Social Sciences, the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food System, and the Sustainability Office will host several faculty members and the vice chancellor of academic affairs from the University of Hawaii West O'ahu campus, along representatives from Ma'o Farms during their two-day UCSC visit.</p>
<p>During the visit, UCSC staff and faculty will share insight about making campus operations more efficient, incorporating green practices into a curriculum, and developing a campus-wide sustainability plan.</p>
<p>Presentations featuring the University of Hawaii and Ma'o Farms will be held at Thursday, April 21st, from 10am-12pm at UCSC's Namaste Lounge, which i<span>s located along the College Nine service road, off of McLaughlin Drive.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://eight.ucsc.edu/earth-week/schedule-of-events.html</url><title>Full schedule for Earth Week activities</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5a00181180727046006b5488e1c7910e"><name>spring-plant-sale</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Farm &amp; Garden’s Annual Spring Plant Sale slated for  April 30 and May 1</title><summary>The UCSC Farm &amp; Garden’s Spring Plant Sale takes place Saturday, April 30, and Sunday, May 1, in the Barn Theater parking lot at the base of the UC Santa Cruz campus, near the intersection of Bay and High streets in Santa Cruz.

<br/>
I am pleased to announce that UC Santa Cruz has been invited to join the Hellman Fellows Program. We are grateful to the Hellman Family Foundation for providing this funding.<br/>
<br/>
This program provides research support to junior faculty in all fields of study, and can help bridge funding streams between start-up packages and the later flow of competitive external funding. Eligible faculty are those at the rank of assistant professor who have completed two or three years of service at that rank at UCSC as of July 1, 2011. Faculty who will be considered for tenure in 2011-12 are not eligible.<br/>
<br/>
Applications are due Monday, May 2, by 5 p.m. and should be emailed to&#160;<a href="mailto:vpaa@ucsc.edu">vpaa@ucsc.edu</a>. More information on the program, including application details, is available at:<br/>

It is likely to be disruptive for many on campus and in&#160;the surrounding community. This message is sent to help members of the campus&#160;community, others with valid reasons for visiting UCSC on the afternoon of April&#160;20, and campus neighbors plan accordingly.</p>
<p>To minimize this anticipated disruption, the following measures will be in place&#160;next Wednesday, April 20:</p>
<p>&#8226; All inbound traffic at the campus's West entrance will be diverted beginning at&#160;2:15 pm.</p>
<p>&#8226; Metro buses will enter campus through the Main Entrance only, travel up Coolidge,&#160;and loop back to the Main Entrance via Hagar. Metro buses during this period of&#160;time will only make one stop in the campus core, on Hagar between Quarry Plaza and&#160;OPERS.</p>
<p>&#8226; A reduced number of campus shuttles will be in operation connecting the east and&#160;west sides of campus, following the normal "core" route west before turning uphill&#160;on Heller, and returning along McLaughlin to the east side of campus. (Disability&#160;van service, with the possible exception of delays caused by traffic congestion,&#160;will be unaffected by these changes.)</p>
<p>&#8226; Campus parking regulations will be strictly enforced.</p>
<p>&#8226; Sections of Empire Grade, uphill from the Arboretum, will be designated as a tow-away zone. Extra patrols will be on duty to enforce this restriction, and vehicles&#160;will be ticketed and towed at owners' expense.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your cooperation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Faculty and Staff</audience><admin>UCSC Public Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6a7759a380727046006b54882e662d65"><name>420-students</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Message about unsanctioned '4/20' event</title><summary>In a message to UCSC students, Student Affairs vice chancellor Felicia McGinty describes the challenges that '4-20' creates for the campus—and provides detail about operational changes in effect that afternoon.</summary><keywords>4-20, students</keywords><start-date>1302768000000</start-date><display-name>Message about unsanctioned '4/20' event</display-name><path>/2011/04/420-students</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/04/420-students</link><created-by>jrburns</created-by><created-on>1303161297148</created-on><last-modified-by>jrburns</last-modified-by><last-modified>1303161542284</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear Students:</p>
<p>I am writing to advise you about a non-University sanctioned event next week, &#8220;4/20&#8221; or &#8220;Four-Twenty.&#8221; As you are probably aware, 4/20&#160;activities create a variety of challenges for everyone in the campus community. The unwelcome event diminishes UCSC&#8217;s reputation and&#160;brings unwanted negative attention to the campus.</p>
<p>Your safety is our priority as well as the need to continue regular University business. To help minimize the disruption of 4/20, please&#160;remember the no overnight guest policy in on-campus residences will be in effect Tuesday, April 19 through Thursday, April 21. You should&#160;also expect traffic delays and different bus and shuttle schedules next Wednesday afternoon and also strict parking enforcement. For more&#160;information on transportation issues, go to the&#160;<a href="http://taps.ucsc.edu/">Transportation &amp; Parking Services Web site</a>.</p>
<p>This notification is being provided to help you plan for April 20 and make positive choices about your time. UCSC continues to educate&#160;students about the risks of alcohol and drug use, provide alternative activities, and enforce University policies. Ultimately, events like 4/20 are&#160;shaped by the individual choices and behaviors of community members. I encourage you to engage with your peers, other campus community&#160;members, and Student Affairs staff about these issues. We can support you in planning and participating in alternative activities that highlight&#160;your accomplishments as scholars and engaged world citizens.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Student Community</audience><admin>Felicia McGinty, Vice Chancellor, Student Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6a98f64080727046006b54884dff149a"><name>admit-data-fall11</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz increases access for California students seeking freshman admission</title><summary>Numbers released today (April 18, 2011) by the UC Office of the President show that UC Santa Cruz offered admission to 17,917 prospective first-year students from California high schools – an increase of more than 1,100 – out of the record 26,136 California high school seniors who applied.

<br/>
<a href="http://www.ucop.edu/news/factsheets/fall2011adm.html">Numbers released today</a> (April 18, 2011) by the UC Office of the President show that UC Santa Cruz offered admission to 17,917 prospective first-year students from California high schools &#8211; an increase of more than 1,100 &#8211; out of the record 26,136 California high school seniors who applied. UCSC also increased offers of admission to out-of-state and international students.<br/>
<br/>
"We are eager to welcome a new group of students" said Michelle Whittingham, associate vice chancellor for enrollment management and director of admissions. &#8220;We will be graduating one of our largest classes this June and this allows us to extend more offers of admission than last year.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
UC Santa Cruz increased the number of admission offers for African American students (113 or 25 percent) and Chicano and Latino students (1,086 or 31 percent) over last year&#8212;more than any other UC campus. Whittingham said the increases in admission to underrepresented students moves the campus closer to reflecting the diversity of California.<br/>
<br/>
Whittingham also noted that UCSC extended admission offers to more students who would be the first in their family to earn a four-year degree than in previous years. Of all UCSC freshmen admission offers, 40.4 percent went to first-generation college students.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing a practice piloted last year, UCSC also "wait-listed" approximately 2,000 first-year applicants for fall 2011 admission. Students will be notified in mid-May if they are accepted to UCSC.<br/>
<br/>
Admitted freshmen have until May 1 to accept their offer of admission. The campus' admissions decisions for the coming fall are based on a goal of enrolling approximately 3,500 new first-year students, about 200 more students than the previous year.<br/>
<br/>
Thousands of admitted students and their families are expected to visit the campus during the annual "Spring Spotlight" for admitted students from April 14 through April 23. Activities include daily student-led walking tours, providing an overview of the academic, residential, and student-life experience at UCSC.<br/>
<br/>
Spring Spotlight is an opportunity to visit the campus&#8217; 10 residential colleges, attend presentations, and visit classrooms. For details, including a schedule of activities, please go to: <a href="http://admissions.sa.ucsc.edu/springspotlight/">admissions.sa.ucsc.edu/springspotlight/</a><br/>
<br/>
Admitted freshmen, their families, and the neighboring community is invited to Day by the Bay, UCSC's second-annual community picnic and open campus on Saturday, April 30. Attendees will find an exciting array of events, including an intellectual forum, local food, wines, and microbrews, along with activities for kids. Details at <a href="http://ucsc.edu/daybythebay">ucsc.edu/daybythebay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Michelle Whittingham, UCSC's associate vice chancellor of enrollment management and director of admissions, is available to discuss freshman admissions to the campus for fall 2011.

<p>While they did not walk away with a top prize, this group of underdogs wowed the judges with its character and conduct.</p>
<p>In fact the group won a special honor, the "Spirit of the American Mock Trial Association Award", given to the team "that best exemplified the ideals of honesty, civility and fair play." They were the only team to be honored in this way.</p>
<p>Also, team member Megan Cole won an All-American Witness Award for serving as a trial witness; she was one of a dozen students honored for exceptional performance in this area.</p>
<p>"Hooray for our team," said UCSC mock trial instructor Dena Robertson. "I am so proud of their accomplishment; I think it is very impressive to win this Spirit award."</p>
<p>UCLA won the overall competition with a score of 6-2, while UCSC scored 3-5.</p>
<p>"But we were the under-Slugs coming in, so I count this a victory," Robertson added.</p>
<p>The debating team defeated expectations twice in a row &#8211; first by scoring out of the regionals, then placing high in the Opening Round Championship Series in Irvine this spring that it nabbed a spot in the nationals.</p>

<br/>
Yamashita will receive a gold medal in the Fiction category for her novel <em>I Hotel</em> at a public awards ceremony to be held in San Francisco on June 2.</p>
<p>The California Book Awards were established by <a href="http://commonwealthclub.org/events/2011-06-02/80th-annual-california-book-awards">The Commonwealth Club</a> in 1931 to honor "the exceptional literary merit of California writers&#8221; whose works were published in the previous year.<br/>
<br/>
Past winners have included such authors as John Steinbeck, Wallace Stegner, Diane Johnson, Ray Bradbury, T.C. Boyle, Amy Tan, and Michael Chabon.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, Yamashita was also nominated for a 2010 National Book Award for <em>I Hotel</em>, her 600-page epic novel published by the independent Coffee House Press&#8212;she was one of five finalists in the Fiction category.<br/>
<br/>
Yamashita is the author of four previous books, including <em>Through the Arc of the Rain Forest</em> (1990), which received the American Book Award, and <em>Brazil-Maru</em>, named by the <em>Village Voice</em> as one of the 25 best books of 1992.<br/>
<br/>
Her third novel, <em>Tropic of Orange</em> (1997), was a finalist for the Paterson Fiction Prize, and she followed that with <em>Circle K Cycles</em> (2001), a book based on her research on the Brazilian community in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Yamashita received the Chancellor&#8217;s Award for Diversity at UC Santa Cruz in 2009.<br/>

<h1>Media reform, policy, activism</h1>
<p><strong>By Corinne Warnshuis</strong></p>
<p>I'm still trying to wrap my mind around the amazing and inspiring information presented at the <a href="http://conference.freepress.net">National Conference for Media Reform</a> in Boston April 8-10. The conference was the fifth of its kind over the past decade, gathering more than 2,500 media reformers, activists, policymakers, artists, students, journalists, and scholars under the motto "Change the Media. Change the World."<br/>
<br/>
Focusing on themes of media reform, policy and activism, the event kicked off early Friday morning with a live broadcast of "Democracy Now!" Host Amy Goodman was just one of the many luminaries I looked forward to hearing.<br/>
<br/>
Others giving lectures and speeches included renowned media scholars Jean Kilbourne, Robert McChesney, Stanford University law and technology professor Lawrence Lessig, and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz. Many important policymakers from Washington also attended, including FCC commissioners and U.S. House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>Public funding</strong></p>
<p>Among the topics were the current attack on federal funding of public media, including PBS and NPR (which, by the way, makes up less than 1/100th of 1 percent of the federal budget), recent mega-mergers (like AT&amp;T&#8217;s acquisition of T-Mobile) and Network Neutrality.<br/>
<br/>
I spent most of my time in panels that focused on women&#8217;s roles in changing media. One panel on copyright issues included an inspiring feminist artist named Elisa Kreisinger who uses Fair Use to remix pop culture videos to create new narratives, resulting in some really interesting readings. Another panel brought together women from the National Organization of Women, ColorLines.com, Sister Song, and Women's Media Center in New York to discuss issues such as reproductive justice, pervasive racial stereotyping and women&#8217;s absence from media ownership. (Less than one-third of women are in decision-making positions in media).</p>
<p><strong>Blending sociology and film</strong></p>
<p>As a sociology major with a minor in film and digital media, I have been able to blend the two departments nicely to fit my interests, putting social justice together with critical cultural analysis. After taking Professor Herman Gray's illuminating seminar "TV &amp; the Nation" during winter quarter, I went into the conference with an understanding of the history, structure, and political economy of the media, as well as a grasp of some of the current issues.<br/>
<br/>
One assigned reading was the revelatory <em>Reality Bites Back: The Troubling Truth about Guilty Pleasure TV</em>.&#160; Its author, Jennifer L. Pozner, who is also founder of the organization Women in Media and News, hosted a media literacy workshop that engaged participants to discuss the representations and stereotypes that reality TV shows reinforce. For me, one of the highlights of the conference was the chance to connect with and talk to such an accomplished and powerful feminist about her work.<br/>
<br/>
Although media issues are women&#8217;s issues, media issues are also universally human rights issues. Media issues affect everyone. When it comes to the media, everyone has something at stake, and everyone should understand its importance.</p>
<p><strong>Call for media reform</strong></p>
<p>As Peter Rothberg from "The Nation" put it: &#8220;Media reform is probably the second most important issue in the world &#8230; Whatever one&#8217;s most important issue is, whether it&#8217;s climate change, ending the wars, income redistribution, social justice, media reform is so critical to any of those issues.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Now back from the conference, I am excited to become educated on the issues, more engaged with the movement, and the many organizations involved, and I am more prepared to spread the word about the importance of media reform to the health and vitality of our democracy.<br/>
<br/>
For the next few days, weeks, and months, I will be doing more research on the issues, organizations, and presenters I learned about, and giving a more detailed re-cap in my blog -- <a href="http://dearmarthas.wordpress.com">dearmarthas.wordpress.com</a> -- including videos from the conference.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://conference.freepress.net</url><title>National Conference for Media Reform  </title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://dearmarthas.wordpress.com </url><title>Corinne Warnshuis's blog</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/04/images/warnshuis-216.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/04/images/warnshuis-216.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>warnshuis-216.jpg</name><display-name>warnshuis-216.jpg</display-name><file-size>53523</file-size><width>216</width><height>90</height></thumb><thumb-alt>CORINNE WARNSHUIS</thumb-alt><title>CORINNE WARNSHUIS</title><description>Sociology major monitors the media after winning a scholarship to attend the National Conference for Media Reform.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6ed4116880727046006b54883100e658"><name>our-university-april</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Our University – budget, advocacy and HR news for UC faculty and staff</title><summary>Read the latest issue of Our University.&#13;

Clifford</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Three UCSC faculty members have been selected as newly elected 2011 fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences:<br/>
<br/>
&#8226; <strong>Thomas Banks</strong>, Distinguished Professor of Physics<br/>
&#8226; <strong>James Zachos</strong>, Professor, Earth and Planetary Sciences<br/>
&#8226; <strong>James Clifford</strong>, Professor Emeritus, History of Consciousness<br/>
<br/>
They join two dozen other current UCSC faculty members who are fellows of the academy, one of the nation's oldest and most prestigious honorary societies.</p>
<p>The three UCSC faculty are among 212 leaders in the sciences, arts, humanities, business, public affairs, and the nonprofit sector, who have been elected this year as fellows and foreign honorary members of the academy.</p>
<p>Among the 2011 class are winners of the Nobel, Pulitzer, and Pritzker Prizes; the Turing Award; MacArthur and Guggenheim fellowships; and Kennedy Center Honors, Grammy, Golden Globe, and Academy awards.</p>
<p>They include astronomer Paul Butler, jazz icon Dave Brubeck, Levi Strauss &amp; Company&#8217;s Robert Haas, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns, actress Helen Mirren, and Nobel laureate writer Mario Vargas Llosa.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas Banks</strong> has been an influential thinker on a broad range of topics in theoretical physics, both individually and in collaboration with other physicists. He has done significant work in areas such as the physics of black holes, particle physics, quantum gravity, and quantum field theory. Banks is the author of a 2008 textbook on quantum field theory titled <em>Modern Quantum Field Theory: A Concise Introduction</em> (Cambridge University Press).<br/>
<br/>
The development of string theory, an ambitious attempt to find a unified theory of the forces of nature, is just one area in which Banks has made important contributions. The first proposal for a complete formulation of string theory was presented in a widely known paper published in 1997 by Banks in collaboration with other scientists. Known as the Matrix theory, it gave rise to many later developments.<br/>
<br/>
A leader in the field of paleoceanography, <strong>James Zachos</strong> studies marine environments in Earth's past by analyzing evidence in the layers of sediments deposited on the seafloor. Using the chemical compositions of fossils and other clues, he and his students are able to reconstruct climate conditions and ocean chemistry during past episodes of extreme climates. They have also been able to show how the climate has responded to periodic changes in Earth's orbit.</p>
<p>Much of Zachos's research has focused on major climate shifts during the past 65 million years, such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). This work is highly relevant to understanding how human activities are driving modern-day global climate change.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>James Clifford</strong> taught in UCSC&#8217;s History of Consciousness Department for 33 years and was founding director of the Center for Cultural Studies. He is best known for his historical and literary critiques of anthropological practice, travel literature, and a variety of cultural performances. He is currently completing a book about indigenous cultural politics that he has been researching for nearly a decade. The book examines what it means to be "rooted" in a world where everything seems to be in motion.</p>
<p>Clifford's new book will complete a trilogy. The widely influential first volume <em>The Predicament of Culture</em> (Harvard University Press, 1988) wove together essays on 20th-century ethnography, literature, and art. It has been translated into eight languages. The second, <em>Routes: Travel and Translation in the Late 20th Century</em> (1997) explored issues of dwelling and travel in anthropology, travel, tourism, and museum work. The books are inventive mixtures of scholarly analysis with meditative essays and poetic experimentation.</p>
<p>The 212 new members join one of the nation&#8217;s leading centers for independent policy research--members contribute to Academy studies of science and technology policy, global security, social policy and American institutions, the humanities, and education.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It is a privilege to honor these men and women for their extraordinary individual accomplishments,&#8221; noted Academy President Leslie Berlowitz. &#8220;The knowledge and expertise of our members give the Academy a unique capacity--and responsibility--to provide practical policy solutions to the pressing challenges of the day. We look forward to engaging our new members in this work.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
The new class of 2011 AAAS fellows will be inducted at a ceremony on October 1, at the Academy&#8217;s headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<br/>

<div>Dear Colleagues,<br/>
<br/>
This is a difficult time for many across the campus as <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/04/galloway-update.html">principal officers and campus leadership evaluate the proposed budget cuts</a>. I ask for your patience as we go through this process.<br/>
<br/>
Many of you have asked about how to suggest ways to trim costs, increase revenue, or make operations more efficient &#8212; suggestions that may or may not have appeared in the broader documents from principal officers. Indeed, last week I met with the graduates of the campus's Leadership Academy for just such an exercise.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, in the Santa Cruz tradition, many people are thinking "out of the box." If you would like to forward a suggestion or comment, <a href="http://www1.ucsc.edu/administration/evc/comment.asp">a web form on my web site</a> enables you to do just that. Submissions can be made anonymously.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.</div>

<p>De parte de:&#160; Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway</p>
<p>Sobre:&#160; El comentario y sugerencias sobre el presupuesto&#160;</p>
<p>Estimados colegas,</p>
<p>Este es un tiempo dif&#237;cil para muchos en todo del campus, a mientras que <a href="galloway-update.xml">los funcionarios principales y el liderazco est&#225;n evaluando los recortes de presupuesto</a>.&#160; Les pido su paciencia a medida que avanzamos en este proceso. &#160;</p>
<p>Muchos de ustedes han preguntado como se pueden sugerir maneras de reducer costos, aumentar los ingresos, o hacer operaciones m&#225;s eficientes--sugerencias que pueden o no han aparecido en los documentos m&#225;s amplio de los funcionarios principales. De hecho, la semana pasada me reun&#237; con los graduados de la Leadership Academy (Academia de Liderazgo) del campus, solo para este dicho ejercicio.</p>
<p>Claramente, en la tradici&#243;n de Santa Cruz, mucha gente esta pensando "fuera de la caja." Si desea enviar una sugerencia o comentario, hay <a href="http://www1.ucsc.edu/administration/evc/comment.asp">un formulario web en mi sitio web</a> que le permite hacer justamente eso. Las comunicaciones se pueden hacer de forma an&#243;nima.</p>
<p>Muchas gracias.</p>

<p>The portable scoreboard was only 5 feet wide and 2.5 feet tall. That&#8217;s not very large considering that home games for the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s soccer teams can draw more than 300 people to the scenic field.</p>
<p>&#8220;Usually it is positioned directly across the field from where the guests sit, but it&#8217;s not ideal,&#8221; said Ryan Andrews, UCSC&#8217;s executive director of Student Engagement, which includes the Office of Physical Education, Recreation and Sports [OPERS], Student Organization Advising and Resources [SOAR] as well as Student Media. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to have pretty good eyes, and it just doesn&#8217;t feel right.&#8221;</p>
<p>This longstanding situation is about to change thanks, to a donation by Wells Fargo Bank, which is paying for the $15,000 project &#8211; the first permanent outer playing field scoreboard in the campus&#8217;s history. The scoreboard will be solar-powered.</p>
<p>A Wells Fargo representative, Michelle Bassi, found out about the scoreboard situation during a tour of the campus, following Wells Fargo&#8217;s initial sponsorship of UCSC&#8217;s annual Scholarship Benefit Dinner. The bank tabled at a recent student orientation event and has ATMS on the campus.</p>
<p>Later, several other Wells Fargo representatives, including Jeff Oellerich, vice president&#8217; community banking district manager, and senior vice president/regional marketing director Alec Hughes, also visited the site and approved the donation to pay for the scoreboard.</p>
<p>The scoreboard&#8217;s installation, scheduled for late this summer, is good news for sports groups that use the field, including men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s soccer, which hold matches as well as practice here. Rugby, ultimate Frisbee and various intramural sports teams also play there.</p>
<p>The new project will be installed in time for a major soccer tournament this fall on campus.</p>
<p>The current portable scoreboard operates on a generator, and must be hauled out for each match.</p>
<p>&#8220;It basically gives you the number of goals and the timing, and that&#8217;s it,&#8221; Andrews said. &#8220;We run a big extension cord to the generator.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dimensions of the upcoming permanent scoreboard will be much more viewer-friendly than the old one. It will be 5 feet and 6 inches high and 16 feet across. The board will be set up on seven-foot-high posts for even better visibility.</p>
<p>As an additional perk, the pesky extension cord will no longer snake across the field; there will be no need to draw power from a generator.</p>
<p>&#8220;This scoreboard is going to enhance the experience for players as well as spectators at the Lower East Field,&#8221; said Kathleen Hughes, UCSC&#8217;s director of development. &#8220;The fact that it&#8217;s solar-powered is an additional boon for the campus. This fits right in with all the eco-friendly building, retrofitting and carbon-reducing projects we&#8217;re seeing on campus right now.&#8221;&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6ff1147b80727046006b5488095b2c5d"><name>future-of-games-symposium</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC looks ahead with Inventing the Future of Games </title><summary>University research and an enthusiasm for bridging disciplines mark the pathways to the future of games, according to speakers at the first-ever Inventing the Future of Games symposium, held April 15. </summary><start-date>1303200000000</start-date><display-name>Inventing the Future of Games</display-name><path>/2011/04/future-of-games-symposium</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/04/future-of-games-symposium</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1303253160980</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1304011940914</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer Mahal</name><title></title><phone/><email>jkmahal@soe.ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/04/images/gillian-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/04/images/gillian-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gillian-300.jpg</name><display-name>gillian-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>79498</file-size><width>300</width><height>263</height></image><image-alt>Gillian Smith</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/04/images/gillian-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/04/images/gillian-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gillian-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>gillian-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>3253</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Gillian Smith</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Graduate student Gillian Smith demonstrated Tanagra, a design tool her team created for computer game developers.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/04/images/prom-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/04/images/prom-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>prom-300.jpg</name><display-name>prom-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>67682</file-size><width>300</width><height>210</height></image><image-alt>Prom Week demonstration</image-alt><image-caption>Prom Week, a social simulation game developed by a team of students, was a popular demonstration at the symposium.

<br/>
More than 250 people from the game industry and academia attended the event at the India Community Center in Milpitas, which featured speeches interspersed with engaging sessions on games and cinema, speaking characters, authoring tools, and games and the future of culture.&#160; The symposium was sponsored by the UC Santa Cruz Center for Games and Playable Media.<br/>
<br/>
Will Wright (The Sims), Rod Humble (Second Life) and Michael Mateas (UCSC, Facade) joined session participants Jordan Mechner (Prince of Persia), Emily Short (Galatea), Tracy Fullerton (USC, The Night Journey), Chris Crawford (Balance of Power), Graeme Devine (7th Guest), Ian Bogost (Georgia Tech, Cow Clicker), Chaim Gingold (Spore), Robin Hunicke (BOOM BLOX), and UCSC computer science professors Noah Wardrip-Fruin, Arnav Jhala, Marilyn Walker, and Jim Whitehead in speaking at the event.<br/>
<br/>
Guests got a look at what research in games looks like at UC Santa Cruz as they browsed graduate students' technology demonstration projects, which lined the lobby.<br/>
<br/>
After an introduction by Art Ramirez, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering, UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal started off the symposium by speaking briefly on the role of university research in game design.<br/>
<br/>
"All of the early games had one thing in common--they came out of research universities and national labs," Blumenthal said, adding later, "UCSC is committed to forward-looking technologies."<br/>
<br/>
It was a theme expanded on by Mateas, associate professor of computer science and director of the Center for Games and Playable Media, in his opening address. Mateas pointed to the innovations other academic fields have contributed to their industry counterparts--from better solar panels to the invention of the Internet.<br/>
<br/>
"In industry, games research is an oxymoron," he said. "The only value is to work on something shipping soon. Games are media, so progress is made by creating things to be experienced."<br/>
<br/>
Mateas explained that his goal is to bring forward the field of computational media, which creates "new tools and approaches that allow you to make games that you couldn't even think of today." Currently, more universities focus on game studies and design research.<br/>
<br/>
"You can't make the Mona Lisa if you only have broken crayons," Mateas said. "You need different tools."<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of art, in a speech on apocryphal game design problems, Linden Labs's Humble said debate about whether games are art has finally been put to rest. Linden Labs runs the virtual world Second Life.<br/>
<br/>
"That's an amazing victory," he exclaimed. "I thought this was going to be the struggle of our lives."<br/>
<br/>
However, he cautioned that becoming a massive art form creates a need for game designers to be responsible.<br/>
<br/>
"I think that games can change human behavior," he said. "I've played games that have changed my entire outlook on life."<br/>
<br/>
Wright, creator of The Sims and Spore, also spoke of games as life-changers, pointing out that we start our lives as children playing games to help us explore and understand reality. The head of game think tank Stupid Fun Club, Wright returned to the idea--first mentioned by Ramirez in his opening comments--that being interdisciplinary is important to the future of games.<br/>
<br/>
"All of the really interesting trends in entertainment are in the intersections," he said, adding that he likes to think of it as "interdisciplinary entertainment."<br/>
<br/>
Wright said that in the future, he can see "people going in as entertainment designers, not game designers, or film directors, or TV producers."<br/>
<br/>
David Yager, dean of the UC Santa Cruz Arts Division, pointed to his work with doctors at Johns Hopkins as an example of what interdisciplinary work can bring to the table.<br/>
<br/>
"My value in a hospital is that I'm not a physician," Yager said. "With the way I see things, I'm able to convey a very different point of view."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://games.soe.ucsc.edu/videos-ifog-2011</url><title>Videos from the Inventing the Future of Games Symposium</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="73f2f80380727046006b5488534f69a4"><name>review-spring-2011-chancellor-letter</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>From the chancellor </title><summary>Chancellor George Blumenthal acknowledges the budgetary challenges facing UC Santa Cruz this spring. </summary><start-date>1303286400000</start-date><display-name>From the chancellor </display-name><path>/2011/04/review-spring-2011-chancellor-letter</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/04/review-spring-2011-chancellor-letter</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1303320393581</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenm</last-modified-by><last-modified>1303326068520</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/04/images/review-spring-2011-chancellor.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/04/images/review-spring-2011-chancellor.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>review-spring-2011-chancellor.jpg</name><display-name>review-spring-2011-chancellor.jpg</display-name><file-size>10704</file-size><width>275</width><height>421</height></image><image-alt>Chancellor Blumenthal</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Chancellor George Blumenthal (photo by Paul Schraub)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Dear Friends, <br/>
<br/>
As you read this issue of <em>Review</em> magazine, you&#8217;ll see that UC Santa Cruz remains fertile ground for innovation and creativity. The people behind our programs are thought leaders who take the initiative, ask bold questions, and change the world. <br/>
<br/>
I feel great pride reading these articles and seeing every day the vibrancy of our campus. Yet I must acknowledge the budgetary challenges facing the campus this spring. I have real concerns about how we will retain our distinctive programs and nurture this unique ecosystem that encourages people to question, explore, discern, and discover. <br/>
<br/>
We face threats that are unprecedented in the 50-year history of California&#8217;s Master Plan for Higher Education. As you likely know, California is wrestling with a $26 billion budget deficit. The best-case scenario for the University of California will be a $500 million cut in the fiscal year that begins July 1; the worst-case would be a cut of $1 billion. This will be the third major cut to the university in the past four years. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to learn more, I encourage you to read our campus&#8217;s coverage of a recent UC Regents meeting, during which I discussed the impacts on UC Santa Cruz of the state&#8217;s ongoing disinvestment in the university (go to our <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/budget-update/">Budget Update page</a> and see updates from March 16). <br/>
<br/>
These are serious cuts. Our challenge is to implement these budget reductions without sacrificing what matters most: the distinctive experience we offer undergraduates, the top-flight research conducted by extraordinary faculty, and our commitment to access and diversity. <br/>
<br/>
Although I am hopeful that the state of California will overcome its persistent budget problems, I do not expect the state to return to previous levels of investment in the university anytime soon. I believe the only way to maintain quality and access is to take our destiny into our own hands and build a long-term vision for the future based on diminished state support. To that end, faculty and staff are joining campus leaders in an internal campus discussion beginning this spring that will chart our course for the future. <br/>
<br/>
As we begin the five-year countdown to our 50th anniversary, we must work harder than ever to ensure that future generations will have access to what we offer at UC Santa Cruz. We owe it to our founders, our alumni, and our current and future students. <br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="73ff48b180727046006b5488ea3dcee3"><name>class-council-giving-2011</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Senior Slugs pay it forward with student-to-student philanthropy project</title><summary>This year, 21 UCSC seniors are asking classmates to help fellow undergraduates pay for their education.

<p>In the past few years they preserved McHenry Library&#8217;s operating hours when threatened with reduction, paid for environmentally friendly building materials at the campus health center, and instituted a carbon fund to reduce UCSC's environmental impact.</p>
<p>Now, 21 seniors are asking classmates to help fellow undergraduates pay for their education.</p>
<p>Members of Class Council 2011 are asking students in their graduating class to contribute $20.11 each. Council members hope to inspire 15 percent of the class to contribute, and expect to raise about $10,000. The council will give the money to the Class of 2012 to distribute in scholarships.</p>
<p>Scholarship contenders must submit essays about the importance of "spirit, legacy, unity, and giving." Not coincidentally, the first letters of those four words spell "SLUG," a reference to UCSC&#8217;s banana slug mascot, which turns 25 this year.</p>
<p>The first round of scholarships is modest--$500 each. But even that is significant, said Brittany Arvizu, 23 (Oakes, marine biology). "That much money can pay for books for a quarter of study,"&#160; Arvizu said. "For students with jobs, it could mean one less day of work every week. It might not seem like a lot of money but it makes a big difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>A student-to-student philanthropy project may sound counterintuitive and risky during these uncertain budget times. The University of California faces cutbacks amounting to a half-billion dollars. But the group insists budget cuts and concerns about student access to education add urgency to their campaign.</p>
<div class="callout-right"><iframe frameborder="0" height="244" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/GLs70p2m40Q" title="YouTube video player" width="380"></iframe></div>
<p>The newly minted group is getting strong responses. An alumna, who prefers to remain anonymous, heard a Class Council presentation this quarter. She was so impressed that she decided to match all gifts to the council up to $10,000.</p>
<p>These students are part of the first senior-class fundraising drive in UCSC history.</p>
<p>But the group has more on its mind than building a pool of money for future graduates, said Cortney Kammerer, 21 (College Eight, business management economics), Class Council 2011's co-president.</p>
<p>Aside from fundraising, the Class Council is creating a social movement to strengthen bonds between future UCSC graduates and the campus, while giving fellow students a stronger sense of identity, pride, and place, Kammerer said.</p>
<p>"There is no big sports team to rally around, so we have to figure out a way to rally around ourselves," Kammerer said.&#160; "Why not make it a positive experience instead of worrying about the budget cuts 24-7? Why not rally around the fact that future graduates will be the next generation of innovators? We&#8217;re proud of them. We need to create lasting ties with them.</p>
<p>"The point is not to advertise school spirit in an artificial way but to change the student body&#8217;s attitude," Kammerer said. "The banana slug mascot sets our campus apart, but it&#8217;s much more than that. It also represents a way of life on campus."</p>
<p>The group created an anchor event called UCSC Slug Pride Week, designed to "instill a legacy fueled by proud Slugs" with student-run activities. The week will include a scavenger hunt and a Zero Reunion Barbecue (a reunion for graduating seniors) along with a "Sip, Snack, and Slug" event. See below for a full list of upcoming Class Council-related events. The Student Council will also take part in the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/04/day-by-the-bay.html">Day by the Bay</a> festivities set for April 30 from 12 to 3 p.m.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to create an engaged young alumni base. "By teaching students the impact philanthropy has on the campus, and instilling a sense of Slug pride, we are cultivating the next generation of philanthropic leaders who will stay connected and continue to give back after they graduate," said UCSC outreach coordinator Shayna Kent.</p>
<p>"Students at UCSC are already very philanthropic," Kent continued. "Stand in front of the [Baytree] Bookstore. You'll see five or six organizations fundraising for different causes. It&#8217;s great to see that student groups are raising money for their own community, too."</p>
<p>As part of its campaign, the group is handing out temporary tattoos showing a banana slug in a frilly red bathing suit, next to the logo: &#8220;GIVING IS SEXY.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to unite the school and raise more spirit,&#8221; Michael Wan, 21 (College Ten, business management), said. "When people have more school pride, they are more likely to give back to the university. Having a big alumni base is important for any university to grow.&#8221;</p>
The group has been approaching fellow students through face-to-face contact, e-mail solicitations, group presentations, and tabling. They plan to run a phone pool soon. 
<p>The task can be scary at first, especially with student attitudes about tuition hikes and the state of the budget.</p>
<p>"It can be intimidating to ask people, especially with the attitude going around the campus because of tuition hikes and the budget," said council member Sandra Drago, 23 (College Ten, literature). "Sometimes at first I get a negative vibe. That changes quickly when they hear this is something that students are doing for other students."</p>
<p>All of the student volunteers are passionate about social issues and access to education.</p>
<p>Suzi Stocken, 31 (College Ten, politics), is active in LGBT causes and hopes to pursue a career in anti-discrimination law. Stocken was vice president of her high school's first gay-straight alliance in 1995. Instead of heading directly to a four-year university after high school, she attended community college classes. She spent time as a photographer for a portrait company, working in sales for AT&amp;T, waiting tables, and bartending. Now that she is back in school, she sympathizes with students having trouble paying for their education.</p>
<p>"I come from a lower-middle-income family--strictly working class," Stocken said. "In these tough economic times, it&#8217;s so important to be there for each other. Small donations of $10, $20, $30--that&#8217;s a night out at the movies. It is not a big sacrifice. Every little bit counts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Through her volunteer work on the Class Council, Stocken hopes to make the path to college less bumpy for other young scholars. "Going back to college was a long time coming for me," she explained. "I&#8217;ve had to do it largely on my own. I&#8217;ve always felt that &#8216;philanthropist&#8217; is the ultimate occupation--to be able to give back to my fellow man."</p>

E-mail us at review@ucsc.edu.   </article-subhead><article-text><h2>Feedback on &#8216;Oh brother, where art thou?&#8217;</h2>
<p><em>Ed. note: We received numerous letters expressing an emotional response to our story on UCSC&#8217;s pioneering art professors, "Oh brother, where art thou?," in the fall 2010</em> Review <em>(page 16), including the ones below.</em><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I especially enjoyed the fall 2010 issue of UC Santa Cruz <em>Review,</em> in particular the article about past art instructors with whom I studied&#8212;in particular Don Weygandt. I am still painting and etching, exhibiting, and teaching a kids' arts and crafts workshop at the Activities Center at Park La Brea, Calif., and I also published an illustrated children's book.<br/>
<em>&#8212;Debora Gillman (Porter &#8217;74, French literature, art minor)</em><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for bringing back some very fond memories of Don Weygandt and his art classes. While I did not make art a career, it has remained a very important part of my life, in part due to lessons learned from Prof. Weygandt's palette.<br/>
<em>&#8212;Tom Frady, pioneer class of &#8217;69 (psychology)</em><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was so happy to see the article about art at UCSC and have often wondered what had become of some of the teachers I dealt with. I was there in 1973, when I transferred as a junior working toward a B.A., mainly in painting. At the time I was just over 40 years old, so I was close in age to the professors in the article.<br/>
<br/>
Don Weygandt was my favorite of the bunch. He had a way of making you feel as though you were special and that you had promise in what you were doing.<br/>
<br/>
The whole experience at UCSC was great, and it gave me the feeling that my need to express my art was a true one.<br/>
<br/>
I have long since thought that UCSC has moved away from art, as I knew it then; it is good to know that it still exists there.<br/>
<em>&#8212; Gerald Avenmarg (Porter &#8217;68, art)</em><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>The article on Don, Doug, and Jack moved me to tears on the train this morning.<br/>
<em>&#8212;Susan Stauber (Porter &#8217;76, art)</em></p>
<h2>Has UCSC lost its edge?</h2>
In the 45th anniversary issue of the <em>Review</em> (fall 2010), I looked in vain for celebration of the unique educational experiment that UCSC represented from its inception. You discuss the university&#8217;s founding solely in terms of the local climate, and you highlight every milestone of enrollment growth. I suggest you keep a copy of <em>The Perpetual Dream</em> (1978), by Gerald Grant and David Riesman, in your offices and make it required reading for your writers and editors. <br/>
<br/>
Universities are subject to "regression toward the mean," and radical institutions like the early Santa Cruz gradually lose their distinctiveness over the years. The early Santa Cruz atmosphere cannot be recaptured, and that's probably just as well. But it should be honored. To quote Michael S. Brown's letter (fall, p. 2, "Your turn"), this is "UCSC's heritage and soul."<br/>
<em>&#8212;Winslow Rogers, parent of current student, Grass Valley, Calif.</em> <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Make evals student optional</h2>
<p>Regarding "Narrative evaluations become instructor optional" (spring 2010, p. 25), I consider this an unfortunate move, and would rather see the Academic Senate make narrative evaluations student optional.<br/>
<br/>
Even looking back after 28 years, I can read my narrative evaluations and see why graduate schools, and later medical schools, recognized that I was an optimal candidate for their programs. My narrative evaluations would have translated into a 4.0 GPA virtually anywhere if graded, but they would say next to nothing about me other than about my academic prowess.<br/>
<br/>
I urge the Academic Senate to reconsider this misguided subversion of UCSC&#8217;s core mission.<br/>

<br/>
You know the feeling when you're in one of these spots: There's a quality to the air, an energy in the atmosphere, an aesthetic, a magnetic <em>something</em> that pulls you in. Think of a novel with a sense of place so strong that the setting becomes a character in its own right. <br/>
<br/>
UC Santa Cruz is one of those places. Your weakness may be the redwood groves, the rolling meadows at the base of campus, the marine layer over the hills. Perhaps it's the bustling plaza, a brilliant professor, a laboratory, a secret spot, a classroom, or some other place where youthful idealism and good ideas rise to the surface. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it's a combination of all these ingredients. Anyone who's spent time on campus knows the feeling. <br/>
<br/>
It's a place that supports an exceptionally large number of flora species, from native wildflowers to Douglas firs&#8212;and, of course, an organic farm and garden. But this place also encourages a strong diversity of thought. Just being up here encourages the mind to wander outside boundaries and across disciplines. Something about the place encourages adventure and risk. It's fertile ground for the imagination. <br/>
<br/>
To illustrate, we present stories about the ways UCSC has attracted and nurtured some of the most gifted creative thinkers over the years ("<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/04/review-spring-2011-brain-farm.html">Brain farm</a>"), how it's enriching bright young minds ("<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/04/review-spring-2011-phage-hunters.html">Phage hunters</a>"), and how it's recently cultivated a growing crop of entrepreneurs ("<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/04/review-spring-2011-entrepreneurs.html">From farming to pharmaceuticals, UCSC sprouts entrepreneurs</a>"). <br/>
<br/>
UCSC's founders dreamed of the campus as an experimental institution of learning&#8212;marked by progressive, cross-disciplinary undergraduate education and innovative teaching methods. Some of the fruits of their labor&#8212; evidenced in profiles of 50 of our alums&#8212;can be seen in <a href="http://45years.ucsc.edu/plus5/index.html">45+5</a>. <br/>
<br/>
We can't wait to see what blooms at UC Santa Cruz next. <br/>

<p>A remarkable planetary system discovered by NASA&#8217;s Kepler mission has six planets around a Sun-like star, including five small planets in tightly packed orbits.</p>
<p>Astronomers at UC Santa Cruz and their coauthors analyzed the orbital dynamics of the system, determined the sizes and masses of the planets, and figured out their likely compositions&#8212;all based on Kepler&#8217;s measurements of the changing brightness of the host star (called Kepler-11) as the planets passed in front of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only is this an amazing planetary system, it also validates a powerful new method to measure the masses of planets,&#8221; said Daniel Fabrycky, a Hubble postdoctoral fellow at UC Santa Cruz, who led the orbital dynamics analysis.</p>
<h3>Student-run carbon fund fights waste, encourages green</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to grouse about food waste, water consumption, and inefficient energy use on campus.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s another thing to reach into your own pocket, raise a pool of money and help UC Santa Cruz solve the problem. An enterprising group of UCSC students is doing just that with the newly instituted Carbon Fund, founded last spring to diminish the campus&#8217;s carbon footprint with environmentally friendly projects undertaken by staff, faculty, and students.</p>
<p>So far the group has set aside $100,000 for this purpose.</p>
<p>The Carbon Fund uses money raised by Measure 44, a student-approved ballot initiative that raises money through a $3-per-quarter student fee. The fee itself is not new; it has been in place since 2006, when students imposed a previous renewable energy ballot measure. Measure 44 simply redirects that money to the Carbon Fund.</p>
<h3>Prof helps in major discovery, wins multiple awards</h3>

<p>A 30,000-year-old finger bone found in a cave in southern Siberia came from a young girl who was neither an early modern human nor a Neanderthal, but belonged to a previously unknown group of human relatives who may have lived throughout much of Asia during the late Pleistocene epoch.</p>
<p>DNA extracted from the bone has yielded a draft genome sequence, enabling scientists to reach some startling conclusions about this extinct branch of the human family tree, called &#8220;Denisovans&#8221; after the cave where the fossils were found.</p>
<p>The findings were reported by an international team of scientists, including many of the same researchers who earlier published the Neanderthal genome. Coauthor Richard Green, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering, played a lead role in the analysis of the genome sequence data, for which a special portal was designed on the UCSC Genome Browser.</p>
<p>Green and his coauthors of the landmark paper describing the Neanderthal genome went on to receive the prestigious Newcomb Cleveland Prize from the American Association for the Advancement of Science in February. Also in February, Green received a Sloan Research Fellowship from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.</p>
<h3>Lit prof&#8217;s novel gains notice</h3>
<p>Karen Tei Yamashita, professor of literature and co-director of the Creative Writing Program, was nominated for a 2010 National Book Award. Yamashita was one of five finalists in the fiction category for her novel I Hotel.</p>
<p>One of the most significant honors in American literary life, the National Book Awards are presented annually by the National Book Foundation.</p>

<h3>A Writer&#8217;s Life</h3>
<p>As part of UCSC&#8217;s 2011 Day by the Bay weekend, the Humanities Division will host a writing symposium on Sunday, May 1. The symposium will feature UCSC alumni writers&#8212; novelists, journalists, and screenwriters&#8212;coming together for a community event to focus on the joys and challenges of writing for a living, the business of writing, and trends for the future. The event is called A Writer&#8217;s Life: A Celebration of Writing at UCSC.</p>

<p class="prCaption">Sue Carter (photo by r. r. jones)</p>
</div>
<p>Sue Carter, a UCSC professor of physics, is pursuing a variety of strategies to develop cheaper and more efficient solar cells. She was awarded five new grants last year totaling more than $1 million to fund her research on new materials and technologies for solar energy.</p>
<p>Carter&#8217;s research focuses on lowering the cost of solar cells and reducing the energy &#8220;payback time&#8221;&#8212;how long it takes a solar cell to generate the amount of energy that was used to manufacture it. Her lab uses thin-film technologies and printable semiconductor materials that enable the production of solar cells using less material and less energy compared to standard manufacturing processes.</p>
<h3><em>Time</em>&#8217;s White House correspondent returns to campus</h3>
<p>Michael Scherer, the White House correspondent for <em>Time</em> magazine and a UC Santa Cruz alumnus (Oakes &#8216;98, creative writing), returned to campus in November to describe his journey from UCSC to riding Air Force One with the president.</p>
<p>Scherer had good news for the creative writing majors who attended his informal talk at Kresge College. &#8220;It&#8217;s not as gloomy as people tell you,&#8221; he said. Opportunities are there &#8220;if you are willing to work cheap and really hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>He worked for a small New Hampshire daily newspaper for a couple of years, then <em>Mother Jones</em> magazine in a job that didn&#8217;t pay enough to live on. A masters in journalism from Columbia University followed, then another stint at <em>Mother Jones,</em> a jump to Salon.com, and finally during the 2008 presidential campaign a call to join <em>Time</em> in covering Republican candidates.</p>

<p class="prCaption">Gabriel Zimmerman, enjoying a walk in Grand Teton National Park in 2009 (photo courtesy of Ross Zimmerman)</p>
</div>
<p>Gabriel Zimmerman, community outreach director for Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., was one of six people fatally wounded in January in Tucson, Ariz., in the shooting rampage that left Giffords critically wounded.</p>
<p>Zimmerman, 30, graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2002 with a degree in sociology. Friends and colleagues remembered Zimmerman as a seasoned community organizer with a strong sense of social justice and conflict resolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;People have to engage,&#8221; said sociology professor Paul Lubeck, who vividly remembers Zimmerman&#8217;s eager presence in three of his classes. &#8220;They have to get out there on the ground, get out into the community, go out and get their hands dirty. He exemplified that.&#8221;</p>
<h3>The Gabriel Zimmerman Scholarship Fund</h3>
<p>Moved by Zimmerman&#8217;s death, UCSC alumnus Jonathan Klein established a scholarship fund in the young congressional aide&#8217;s honor and offered an initial gift.</p>
<p>In March, the fund exceeded the $50,000 level needed to endow it.</p>
<p>The Gabe Zimmerman Scholarship will provide funds for outstanding students in the Division of Social Sciences who wish to pursue public service.</p>

<p class="prCaption">Possibly the most distant galaxy ever seen (image provided by NASA, ESA, Garth Illingworth [UCSC], Rychard Bouwens [UCSC and Leiden University] and the HUDF09 team)</p>
</div>
<p>Astronomers studying ultra-deep imaging data from the Hubble Space Telescope have found what may be the most distant galaxy ever seen, about 13.2 billion lightyears away. The study pushed the limits of Hubble&#8217;s capabilities, extending its reach back to about 480 million years after the Big Bang, when the universe was just 4 percent of its current age.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re getting back very close to the first galaxies, which we think formed around 200 to 300 million years after the Big Bang,&#8221; said Garth Illingworth, UCSC professor of astronomy and astrophysics.</p>
<p>Illingworth and UCSC astronomer Rychard Bouwens (now at Leiden University in the Netherlands) led the study.

Organic vegetables do well up here, too.</p>
<p>But UCSC is fertile ground for far more than flora and fauna. It's also a place where animated films, prizewinning novels, and tomorrow's computer games germinate and thrive. Sometimes, the projects begin on campus. Other times, the university inspires projects that flourish elsewhere.</p>
<p>These people and projects may not seem to have much in common. But all of them are connected in one important way:</p>
<p>Each flourished because the UCSC campus gave them the necessary nutrients to thrive.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the presence of other colleagues offering inspiration and critical insight. It might have been the way the campus encourages people to question assumptions, recognize a rising talent, and draw outside disciplinary lines.</p>
<p>Or it could be the sheer beauty of the campus, and the way the setting inspires creativity.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at some of the talents, projects, and creative expression that have prospered at UCSC. But first, a disclaimer:</p>
<p>This is by no means an exhaustive list; consider it a crop sampler.</p>
<h3>Growing games</h3>
<div class="callout-right"><img alt="Michael Mateas" height="141" src="images/review-spring-2011-mateas.jpg" width="191"/><span>Michael Mateas</span></div>
<p>UCSC is known for an atmosphere that allows creative work to happen and prosper. That's what lured innovative game designer Michael Mateas to campus.</p>
<p>Now the director for UCSC's Center for Games and Playable Media, he is planting seeds for a new generation of games. Instead of just preparing students for today's gaming, he wants them to look beyond the realm of zombie shooters and rescue missions.</p>
<p>"I want innovation and new experiences," Mateas says. "And I want to get those experiences into the hands of as many people as possible."</p>
<p>But what does that future look like? Mateas believes it will be a time for "interactive dramas," self-contained, social network-driven projects featuring fully conversational characters, who will work with players to shape the storyline. Perhaps we'll get closer to the "holodeck," the interactive room that sent Captain Jean-Luc Picard and his crew into the Wild West in <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation.</em></p>
<p>In 2005, a year before his arrival at UCSC, Mateas&#8212;along with co-creator Andrew Stern&#8212;solidified his reputation with a quirky interactive drama called Fa&#231;ade. Challenging design clich&#233;s, it rebelled against the idea of an "open world" game in which characters range across vast spaces. Instead, the action unfolds at an awkward party hosted by the unhappily married Grace and Trip. The player is the third wheel in their nasty disputes.</p>
<p>The <em>New York Times</em> and <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> hailed the game's innovation, including the unusual depth of its artificial intelligence and the fluent language of its characters. It has much more in common with an Edward Albee play than a Sylvester Stallone movie.</p>
<p>"The game was a contrarian stance," Mateas says.</p>
<p>Mateas was drawn to UCSC because it was creating an innovative undergraduate degree program&#8212;the first of its kind in the UC system&#8212;and he saw the campus as a place that was flexible enough to put itself at the forefront of a new field of study. In return, UCSC gave him the resources to recruit strong faculty and establish the Center for Games and Playable Media&#8212;one of the largest technical game research groups in the world. The campus also has fostered collaborations with the Art and Digital Arts and New Media departments.</p>
<p>Now Mateas is creating rich soil for students and colleagues to grow ideas of their own, including a soon-to-be-released game called <em>Prom Week,</em> which was designed entirely by UCSC game design graduate students. Mateas and Noah Wardrip-Fruin are the design team's advisors.</p>
<p>In <em>Prom Week,</em> players try to manipulate characters including the nerdy Zack, who wants to be Prom King. In one scenario, he impresses a classmate, Naomi, by flexing his biceps, only to blow his chances by showing off an ill-timed light saber trick. "Yer weird!" Naomi declares.</p>
<p>In doing so, the player changes the social dynamic of the school, but only to a point.</p>
<p>"You can't make these characters do anything they don't want to do," Mateas says.</p>
<p>Like <em>Fa&#231;ade, Prom Week</em> will be released free of charge.</p>
<h3>Roots of greatness</h3>
<div class="callout-right"><img alt="Raymond Carver" height="141" src="images/review-spring-2011-carver.jpg" width="191"/><span>Raymond Carver</span></div>
<p>American short story writer and poet Raymond Carver (May 25, 1938&#8211;August 2, 1988) is considered a major American writer of the late 20th century and a force in the revitalization of the short story in the 1980s.</p>
<p>When Carver arrived as a lecturer in 1971, the writing scene was thriving. George Hitchcock, influential editor and founder of the literary magazine <em>Kayak,</em> was here. So were authors Jim Houston and Page Stegner.</p>
<p>A master of dialogue, Carver turned conversations into games of misdirection. Dialogue should be "non-sequiturs," he told his students.</p>
<p>Many early stories of this celebrated writer are sad and bruising, but his brief period at UCSC was productive and enjoyable for him, bolstering his confidence, starting lifelong friendships, and inspiring some of his early works. His friend and colleague, David Swanger, says Carver's outgoing, low-key personality melded with the writing scene on campus.</p>
<p>"Working relationships were not bureaucratic, official, or competitive," says Swanger, now a UCSC professor emeritus of education and creative writing. "We were all starting out and we were all in it together, and he was a man whose friendships counted."</p>
<p>Carver and Swanger frequented a Santa Cruz restaurant that provided free dinners to poets who read their work out loud.</p>
<p>"It was big deal for Ray and me," Swanger recalls. "Reading was not something we took for granted. It was celebratory."</p>
<p>"Life spread before Ray like a buffet in Santa Cruz," writes Carol Sklenicka in her Carver biography. "His letters, typed on university letterhead ... convey the excitement of a kid in a candy shop."</p>
<p>This excitement included <em>Quarry West,</em> the literary magazine Carver launched here.</p>
<p>"This guy who became the American Chekhov was so thrilled about this small university literary magazine that he ran into the cafeteria during lunchtime to show me a review that had been written about it," Swanger recalls.</p>
<p>Soon after his UCSC stint, Carver became a much-lauded writer, but he stayed in contact with Swanger. Artifacts from that friendship&#8212;26 letters, notes, and cards that Carver penned to Swanger&#8212;now have a permanent home in UCSC's Special Collections.</p>
<h3>Cross-disciplinary currents</h3>
<div class="callout-right"><img alt="Karen Yamashita" height="141" src="images/review-spring-2011-yamashita.jpg" width="191"/><span>Karen Yamashita</span></div>
<p>Acclaimed writer and UCSC literature professor Karen Tei Yamashita refuses to squirrel herself away when creating fiction. She puts herself in the world, allowing life and learning to inform her work.</p>
<p>This campus turned out to be the ideal place for her creative expression to thrive; UCSC's world of ideas, and its thinkers from various disciplines on campus, helped inform and grow her work.</p>
<p>In 1997, the year she was hired to teach at UCSC, she began work on her book <em>I Hotel,</em> which was shortlisted last year for the National Book Award.</p>
<p>"It is a small miracle that the long work of this book and the stories of these people and this history were honored by the NBA," says Yamashita, who believes the book "would not have happened" without her UCSC job.</p>
<p>UCSC gave her access to the Bay Area and the diverse Asian American community that populates her book, which concerns a standoff over evictions at San Francisco's International Hotel.</p>
<p>Wisdom gleaned from UCSC lectures, conferences, and graduate seminars made its way into her work. So did the scholarship of colleagues like Daniel Linger in anthropology, who shared research about Brazilian migrant workers in Japan, and professor emerita of American studies Judy Yung, who helped her re-create the culture of San Francisco's Chinatown in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Yamashita found it striking that the book covers the same time period when UCSC began to take shape in the 1960s.</p>
<p>The time correlation is perhaps "not a coincidence," she speculates now. Some of the ideals that informed the creation of the campus can also be found in her work.</p>
<p>"The founding history of UCSC is embedded in this time period. Those ghosts of change must also be present."</p>
<h3>Incubating Freedom</h3>
<div class="callout-right"><img alt="Jonathan Franzen" height="141" src="images/review-spring-2011-franzen.jpg" width="191"/><span>Jonathan Franzen</span></div>
<p>Some plants require agitated soil. Others grow best with little disturbance. Put bestselling author Jonathan Franzen in the latter category. He famously wore noise-blocking headphones while creating his 2001 National Book Award&#8211;winning novel <em>The Corrections.</em></p>
<p>Franzen craves quiet while at work, and he found that space at UCSC, where he frequently used offices at Cowell College during the years he was working on his critically acclaimed 2010 best-seller, <em>Freedom.</em> The secluded, forested campus turned out to be an ideal spot for him to create. (Franzen does not teach at UCSC, but he lives in Santa Cruz part-time.)</p>
<p>"UCSC is a great place to write fiction, especially in the summer months, when the campus is very quiet and the days often start out very foggy," writes Franzen via e-mail. "I can go from the fog of sleep and up the foggy drives to a dark office, put in a good morning in the dream state of fiction-writing, and then emerge to a beautiful blue sky in the early afternoon."</p>
<p>Franzen is not the only creative mind to find safe haven at UCSC. For example, Tom Lehrer&#8212;the fearless musical satirist of the Cold War era&#8212;turned his back on his career and later became a UCSC math lecturer while collaborating on campus musical productions. The late Spalding Gray, actor and comic monologist, took part in a performance group workshop on the UCSC campus in 1978 and performed here well into the '90s.</p>
<h3>Seeds of magic</h3>
<div class="callout-right"><img alt="Mark Henne" height="141" src="images/review-spring-2011-henne.jpg" width="191"/><span>Mark Henne</span></div>
<p>Pixar animator Mark Henne adds weight, impact, and movement to digital characters&#8212;and his years at UCSC led to a creative partnership that continues to inspire his work more than 20 years later.</p>
<p>Consider the robots swarming through the Axiom starliner, and the overweight human "guests" zipping around in self-propelled lounge chairs in the computer-animated movie <em>Wall-E.</em></p>
<p>In 1990, Henne graduated from UCSC's computer science masters program, where the seedlings of his Pixar career were planted. Much of his current work grows out of his mentorship with Jane Wilhelms, the UCSC professor who stretched his understanding of animation's potential.</p>
<p>He remembers Wilhelms investigating the possibilities of movement during a summer conference he attended. She had animated gymnast characters twirling on parallel bars, and boxy, bug-like beings swarming through an environment.</p>
<p>"She wasn't directing their path," Henne says. "It was kind of an AI (artificial intelligence) approach where they somehow could reason about where they were and the obstacles in front of them."</p>
<p>Her ideas influenced Henne, who still thinks about crowd dynamics when animating groups of characters. To show crowd movement, he says, you must start with the individual and build outward.</p>
<p>The classic example is a flock of birds. The flock doesn't have a thought process, he says. The amalgamation of individual behaviors creates the crowd's behavior: "Follow my neighbor but don't let them get too close." "If a gull has a fish, let's try to take it."</p>
<p>Henne, who wrote his UCSC master's thesis about flexible digital skin for human characters, does not believe in technology for its own sake. But by showing him the possibilities of animation, UCSC taught him how to captivate a movie audience.</p>
<h3>Sound of silents</h3>
<div class="callout-right"><img alt="Shelley Stamp" height="141" src="images/review-spring-2011-stamp.jpg" width="188"/><span>Shelley Stamp</span></div>
<p>The UCSC campus helped film and digital media professor Shelley Stamp&#8212;an expert on silent movies and early women filmmakers&#8212; start a small project that grew into an international franchise.</p>
<p>Along with her former colleague Amelie Hastie, now an associate professor at Amherst College, she coordinated a conference that would draw 60 film scholars to explore and celebrate the remarkable&#8212;but often overlooked&#8212;contributions of women to the silent films of the early 20th century.</p>
<p>The conference was the first of its kind. For years, women's early contributions to film were neglected in film studies, in spite of the astonishing amount of influence and creative control they had in the industry.</p>
<p>But the idea took off. Since then the conference, designed as an open and friendly place to share research and ideas, spread from Santa Cruz to Montreal, Guadalajara, Stockholm, and Bologna. Another Women and the Silent Screen conference is already planned for Melbourne, Australia, in 2013.</p>
<p>UCSC's long-standing, pioneering support for feminist scholarship made it a logical launching pad for the series of conferences, said Stamp.</p>
<p>"And although my current research takes me to archives in New York, D.C., and Los Angeles, the community of feminist scholars here provides me with a sustaining and inspiring home base," she says.</p>
<p>Aside from helping to grow a conference, Stamp helps her young UCSC students grow future careers by encouraging them to look into filmmaking's distant past.</p>
<p>"Students come into the program with an incredible level of media literacy," Stamp continues. "But several of them confessed to me that they'd never seen a black-and-white film, and some have never seen a film more than 10 years old. It is my job and also my great pleasure to get them excited about the older films. Their socks are blown off by the rich cinema culture that existed before 1928."</p>
<p>Clearly, the students are paying attention.</p>
<p>One former student is the archivist at Francis Ford Coppola's American Zoetrope Films. Another is vice president for development at Warner Bros. Pictures.</p>
<p>"The best students recognize that you can't move forward without seeing what came before you," Stamp says.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="79c2c73a80727046006b54885419c577"><name>community-building-study</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Diversity and Community Building Study begins next week </title><summary>UCSC’s Diversity and Community Building Study begins next week. </summary><keywords>diversity, Community Building Study</keywords><start-date>1303372800000</start-date><display-name>Community Building Study</display-name><path>/2011/04/community-building-study</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/04/community-building-study</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1303417898700</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1303418438092</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>UCSC&#8217;s Diversity and Community Building Study begins next week.

It will start with two online surveys of the entire student body, with one focusing on undergraduate students and the other on graduate students. There will also be questions on campus-wide climate for diversity and inclusion. Faculty and staff surveys will take place in fall 2011. <br/>
 &#160; <br/>
 <strong>SPEAK YOUR MIND &amp; WIN AN iPAD!</strong> Students who complete the survey will have several opportunities to win a prize. During the month of May, we will have a daily random drawing for a $50 gift card to the Bay Tree Bookstore. At the end of the survey we will have a random drawing for two iPads &#8211; our Grand Prizes. Also, the college with the highest response rate will receive an award of $300 to support its own programs.<br/>
 <br/>
 The study&#8217;s main goals are to evaluate the university&#8217;s existing culture and institutional support of all members of our campus community, and to provide valuable information for improvement of everyday practices, policy decisions and other community-building efforts. <br/>
 &#160; <br/>
 The undergraduate student survey is part of a new national study conducted by the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) at UCLA and involves five other UC campuses. This survey focuses on students&#8217; academic and social experiences in a diverse learning environment.<br/>
 <br/>
 The graduate student survey is part of an ongoing effort to evaluate and improve graduate programs and services.. The Division of Graduate Studies, with the assistance of Institutional Research, has conducted this survey since 2007. <br/>
 <br/>
 I ask every student to look for an email invitation and complete the survey. I also ask all members of administration, faculty and staff to support this study by encouraging student participation. If you have questions or comments regarding this study, you can email me at <a href="mailto:diversity@ucsc.edu">diversity@ucsc.edu</a>. <br/>

<div class="callout-right"><strong>Cooper will give a reading at the Bay Tree Bookstore at noon on April 29.</strong></div>
In her new book, UC Santa Cruz psychology professor Catherine R. Cooper examines how culturally diverse youth can develop pathways to college without losing ties to their families, peers, and cultural communities. <br/>
<br/>
Cooper, founding director of the doctoral program in developmental psychology at UCSC, is the author of <em>Bridging Multiple Worlds: Cultures, Identities, and Pathways to College</em> (Oxford University Press, 2011). Following book signing events earlier this month at professional gatherings in Montreal and New Orleans, she will give a reading at the Bay Tree Bookstore on the UCSC campus at noon on April 29.<br/>
<br/>
The work that culminated in the book began with a collaboration 30 years ago in Texas and draws on an ongoing set of collaborations that extend across California to Hawaii, Australia, and Israel. Cooper developed much of the material in the book with graduate students and colleagues, while teaching an undergraduate class at UC Santa Cruz called "Cultural Perspectives on Adolescence."<br/>
<br/>
Based on new evidence from a wide variety of cultural communities, Cooper&#8217;s Bridging Multiple Worlds theory also brings together insights from psychology, anthropology, education, and sociology to understand how individuals, families, and institutions can open educational opportunities from preschool through college.&#160; In addition to this new theoretical framework, the book provides practical tools for partnerships among researchers, educators, families, and students themselves. <br/>
<br/>
"Under what conditions do these students succeed? That is the focus of this book,&#8221; she said. "It is crucial to understand what works." <br/>
<br/>
The traditional notion that success requires culturally diverse youth to relinquish their family and cultural ties doesn't hold up to research evidence, Cooper says. &#8220;Our work shows that among the most successful pathways is one in which youth draw resources from across their cultural worlds as they learn new skills such as academic English and advanced math.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Cooper is the director of the Bridging Multiple Worlds Alliance, a network of researchers, educators, and policymakers who focus on understanding how culturally diverse young people build their pathways through school. BMWA helps youth build pathways to college while improving practice and advancing knowledge, in collaboration with alliance partners and youth themselves. <br/>
<br/>
In a local collaboration that is part of this network, Cooper has worked for the past 15 years with Elizabeth Dom&#237;nguez, Director of the Cabrillo Advancement Program (CAP) at Cabrillo Community College. CAP helps low-income middle and high school students succeed in school and attend college. It celebrated its 20-year anniversary last month. <br/>
<br/>
With CAP students participating as researchers, the CAP-UCSC partnership maps their resources, challenges, and pathways from the time youth enter the program at age 12 into early adulthood. These activities help students and help the program link its services to student learning.<br/>

On Friday, April 15, they beat Cal Tech 9-0 and were able to play almost everyone who made the trip. <br/>
<br/>
Erik Rosner and Ian Stanley won at one doubles, Bryce Bettwy and Chris Goetz won at two doubles, and Josh Mason and Jordan Randolf won at three doubles. In singles, Sam Rodgers led the singles sweep followed by Ian Stanley, Erik Rosner, Bryce Bettwy, Josh Mason, and Chris Goetz.<br/>
<br/>
Next up was Pomona Pitzer Colleges, who came into the match ranked 8th in the country with a 15-2 record. The Slugs jumped out to an early lead in all three doubles. But the Hens fought hard and were able to turn around the early leads at one and two doubles to win 8-6 at one and 9-7 at two doubles to take a lead into the singles. <br/>
<br/>
Erich Koenig and Sam Rodgers continued their recent strong play, winning 8-4 at three doubles. <br/>
<br/>
With their backs to the wall, the team came out firing in singles. First off was Erich Koenig, who showed that he is one of the top players in the West region in defeating Chris Wiechert 6-3, 6-0. <br/>
<br/>
Next off was Yushi Ayabe, who won 6-4, 6-3 at six singles, putting the Slugs up 3-2. Brian Pybas started strong in the first set, winning 6-2, and then held strong to win the second in a tiebreaker to put the Slugs within one win of clinching. After losing the first set, Parker Larsen righted the ship and iced the match with a 4-6, 6-0, 6-3 win at three singles. Andre Halabi got on the board with a 6-4, 7-6 win at four singles, hitting more winners than ever and showing off his improved offense. <br/>
<br/>
With the match decided, Sam Rodgers lost a very close tiebreaker for the third set against Max Sabel in a beautifully played match by both players. In exhibition matches, Chris Goetz and Bryce Bettwy posted a win in doubles, and Jordan Randolf won in singles.<br/>
<br/>
Against Chapman University, the Slugs played their top three doubles teams and rolled to a 3-0 lead with Brian and Parker winning 8-4 at one, Rosner and Stanley winning 8-6 at two, and Koenig and Rodgers winning 8-2 at three. <br/>
<br/>
In singles, Yushi Ayabe led the way with a straight set win at one singles to remain undefeated. At two singles, Ian Stanley bounced back from a first set loss to dominate the second and third sets in a 3-6, 6-1, 6-1 victory. Rosner, Bettwy, Mason, and Goetz all won in straight sets, showing team strength and massive improvement throughout the lineup in this 9-0 victory.<br/>

<br/>
College Nine, founded at UC Santa Cruz in fall 2000, celebrates its 10th anniversary the weekend of May 13-15 with a multitude of events including "Peace on Fire: Global Blues, Poetry, &amp; Politics," a spoken-word and live music performance featuring Angela Davis, Corey Harris, Ekua Omosupe, and Shailja Patel on Saturday, May 14 at Kuumbwa Jazz Center in Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
Details are available at <a href="http://collegenine.ucsc.edu/news/alumni/">collegenine.ucsc.edu/news/alumni/</a>.<br/>
<br/>
College Nine opened with the theme of international and global perspectives and a close association with the Division of Social Sciences. Professor Helen Shapiro, provost since 2006, said the anniversary is a chance to celebrate the uniqueness of College Nine and everything it has accomplished in its first 10 years.<br/>
<br/>
"It is also an opportunity to highlight and celebrate the continuing importance of the colleges at UC Santa Cruz," Shapiro said. <br/>
<br/>
Anniversary events kick off with the screening at 7 p.m. Tuesday, April 26, of&#160; "Will the Real Terrorist Please Stand Up," a new documentary film by acclaimed filmmaker Saul Landau. The film tells the story of five Cuban intelligence agents now imprisoned in the United States who infiltrated Miami-area groups plotting against their homeland. The screening is at the Colleges Nine and Ten multipurpose room and will be followed by Landau's comments and a question-answer session. <br/>
<br/>
Saturday night, May 14,&#160; "Peace on Fire," an event for the community, takes place at Kuumbwa Jazz Center. Doors open at 7 p.m.; the event begins at 8 p.m.&#160; All proceeds benefit the College Nine Book Fund, established in honor of the 10-year anniversary. The fund provides textbooks for low-income students.<br/>
<br/>
Tickets are $25 or $50 for VIP "Gold Circle" admission that includes entrance, a brief and informal meet-and-greet with the performers after the event, wine and cheese reception, and a signed commemorative poster. Tickets are available at Streetlight Records in Santa Cruz and online at <a href="http://inticketing.com./">inticketing.com</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Headlining the evening is UC Santa Cruz professor emerita Angela Davis, for whom a residential house at College Nine is named.&#160; Also appearing will be Shailja Patel, a poet, playwright, and activist, born in Kenya, who now splits her time between Nairobi and Berkeley; Ekua Omosupe, a Cabrillo College English instructor who received her M.A. and Ph.D degrees in literature from UCSC; and Corey Harris, a delta blues and reggae musician, who has attracted a wide following. He was named a MacArthur Fellow in 2007.&#160;&#160; <br/>

<br/>
It presents the work of a variety of UCSC alumni who are active and practicing artists from New York to California.<br/>
<br/>
The show is curated by Julie Baker (Porter '89), executive director of the Center For The Arts in Grass Valley, who has also spent time working in New York art galleries and Christie's auction house.<br/>
<br/>
"It is so gratifying to return to UCSC 22 years after I graduated to curate this show, and to include artists I know personally, or have come to admire, in my years as a gallery owner,&#8221; says Baker.</p>
<p>&#8220;UCSC should be proud of such an amazing group of talented and successful artists,&#8221; she added.<br/>
<br/>
One of those artists&#8212;Charles Goldman (Porter '90) has just learned that he was one of 180 applicants out of 3,000 who has been awarded a 2011 Guggenheim Fellowship in the 87th annual competition for the United States and Canada.<br/>
<br/>
Goldman graduated from UCSC in 1990 with a double major in Painting and American Studies. He is permanently based in Brooklyn, NY, and has exhibited internationally.<br/>
<br/>
The featured alumni artists will also include: <strong>Delia Brown, Jason Middlebrook, Mungo Thomson, Nellie King Solomon, Don Fritz, Sarah Coleman, Andrea Borsuk, Michelle Stitz, Evan Holloway</strong> and <strong>Julie Heffernan</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
An informal reception for the artists is planned for Alumni weekend on April 30.<br/>
<br/>
These events are sponsored by the UCSC Alumni Association Special Projects Fund. More information about UCSC&#8217;s Alumni Weekend can be found at the <a href="ucsc.edu/daybythebay">Day By The Bay</a> web site.<br/>

<br/>
So begins graduate student Meredith Drum in the written description of her project, <em>Louisiana Re-Storied</em>, for the UC Santa Cruz <strong>Digital Arts and New Media (DANM) 2011 MFA Exhibition</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Tracing plastics to their birthplace, <em>Louisiana Re-Storied</em> is an interactive documentary examining the massive petrochemical plants along the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans--home to communities that suffer disproportionately from this weakly regulated industry,&#8221; she goes on to explain.<br/>
<br/>
Drum is one of 10 DANM graduate students at UCSC exhibiting works in the program&#8217;s annual show that are employing advanced technologies for creative potential and social impact.<br/>
<br/>
The students&#8217; final projects will be featured in <em>Permutations, the 2011 DANM MFA exhibition</em>, set for April 30-May 1 and May 5-8, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at UCSC&#8217;s Digital Arts Research Center.<br/>
<br/>
The culmination of two years of research and artistic exploration, the show includes new media works that focus on performance, interactivity, and participation.<br/>
<br/>
DANM faculty member Soraya Murray is curator of the exhibition.</p>
<p>She said that by combining innovative storytelling with new technology, the student artists are&#160; experimenting with digital media to produce unforeseen outcomes or &#8220;permutations.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The title &#8216;Permutations&#8217; arose from a conversation between all of the artists and myself,&#8221; said Murray. &#8220;While there were vastly different types of work being done, the one common theme everyone shares is their use of tools that we call &#8216;digital,' recombining or reconfiguring them to give rise to something more.&#8221;&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Murray noted that through their projects and research, the DANM students are probing fundamental questions and examining the borders and edges of new media art practices.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Much of the work is oriented toward the experiential,&#8221; said Murray. &#8220;It encourages participants to have a hands-on experience in relationship to social and ethical concerns--or even in relation to simply being in the world. The work asks, &#8216;how can we think differently about this, or come at it from a totally different angle?&#8217;&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Several of the works also use technology to point back to the body and the senses--which is interesting since so much of the mythologies around technology are about escaping the limits of the body,&#8221; Murray added.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Much of this art throws the body right back into the mix, and in a way, the participants actually complete the work with their own bodies by playing, touching, and engaging.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
A reception for the exhibition will be held on Friday, May 6, from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. at the Digital Arts Research Center, immediately followed by a performance of a newly composed opera. Admission is free and open to the public.<br/>

(Photos by Jim MacKenzie)<br/></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>A unique genomics class offers motivated freshmen the opportunity to do first-hand research </article-subhead><article-text><p>After shaking out small strips of paper from test tubes, the phage hunters bend over the table in concentration, moving pieces around until the strings of A&#8217;s, C&#8217;s, G&#8217;s, and T&#8217;s that form DNA start matching and overlapping. Under the fluorescent lights of the laboratory, the phage hunters are solving this puzzle on their path to tackling greater mysteries in the biomedical world.</p>
<p>This is the Phage Genomics class, and the phage hunters&#8212;freshmen just beginning their college careers&#8212;are already conducting original investigations. &#8221; Phage hunting&#8221; is the art, science, and adventure of finding phages (viruses that infect bacteria) in the wild, breaking down and studying their DNA, and figuring out what genes they hold.</p>
<p>Along with 11 other universities, UC Santa Cruz has offered the three-quarter Phage Genomics course for three years as part of the Science Education Alliance, developed and funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). Molecular, cell and developmental (MCD) biology professors Grant Hartzog and Manuel Ares lead the lab, where freshmen learn laboratory skills, independence, and critical thinking, but most of all, a love of meaningful research.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard for motivated undergrads to find research opportunities,&#8221; Hartzog says. Phage genomics is a good entry into research because the technical manipulations at the beginning are quite simple, he says, but as students get deeper into the project, the techniques and questions grow in sophistication.</p>
<p>On this day in mid-February, the students have just received data from a DNA sequencing center and are about to start analyzing their phage DNA sequence. The exercise using paper strips with letter strings&#8212;representing bases, the building blocks of DNA&#8212;gives them a chance to work through the process computers undertake to combine the many DNA fragments obtained by the sequencing center into an entire phage genome sequence.</p>
<p>The class is studying mycobacteriophages, viruses that infect mycobacteria. An infecting phage can kill the bacteria or it can integrate its DNA into the host chromosome. Once integrated, the phage can stay inside the bacteria without causing harm; in this way, phages can be used to manipulate bacteria. Although the students are studying a harmless mycobacterium that lives in soil, it is related to a mycobacterium that causes tuberculosis; understanding mycobacteriophages has been a key to understanding tuberculosis genetics. Phages are abundant in nature, but their genetic diversity and complexity have only recently been recognized. The contributions of this class of phage hunters will add to the growing bank of phage, mycobacteria, and possibly tuberculosis knowledge.</p>
<p>&#8220;This helps people understand the genome of the bacteria, and has applications in bacterial infections,&#8221; says student Julia Froud, 19, of Cowell College. &#8221; I like the idea of finding out something no one in the scientific community has ever seen.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Helping minority students pursue research</h3>
<p>Launched nationally by the National Institutes of Health, the Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) and Initiative for Maximizing Student Diversity (IMSD) programs have been a part of campus life for several decades. <a href="review-spring-2011-marc-imsd.xml">Read more</a></p>
</div>
<h3>Gene finding</h3>
<p>Phage Genomics gives freshmen the chance to go out into the field and collect soil samples, use powerful lab tools such as electron microscopes to view their samples magnified many thousands of times, and analyze phage DNA to find genes and their possible functions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gene finding is a bit of an art,&#8221; says Hartzog. &#8221; Just because a student sees their gene prediction matches that for a related gene in a database doesn&#8217;t mean either prediction is necessarily valid. They need to critically evaluate the data, and not just trust [the database].&#8221;</p>
<p>The students and professors from the inaugural class of the 12 participating schools coauthored a paper published this January in academic journal PloS ONE, presenting the 18 new mycobacteriophages isolated by freshmen. Their work indicated that, among other things, mycobacteriophages are still under-sampled, since the students had found phages with genomes completely unrelated to known phages.</p>
<p>Every year, Hartzog and Ares invite incoming freshmen who have done well in high school biology to apply for the class. There is a written application, then an interview, during which the professors look out for the spark that tells them that student will succeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the applicants are smart, but the interviews help us see who&#8217;s motivated, who&#8217;s interested in the world,&#8221; Hartzog says.</p>
<p>Ares believes research universities provide a different flavor of education than schools focused solely on teaching: professors at research universities are practitioners of their field, and can expose students to the roots of how we know what we know.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we produce students who know fixed facts, their knowledge is static and stagnant. But if we incorporate an experimental basis of understanding, now we&#8217;ve produced students who can continue to learn and teach themselves,&#8221; Ares says.</p>
<p>Such self-directed learning can be challenging. For enterprising phage hunters, when the going gets tough, the tough use the Phage Hat. A wearable talisman Hartzog made to inspire stymied students, the Phage Hat is an impressive contraption of foil, cardboard, and good vibes. No one has failed to isolate a phage yet, so the Phage Hat must be working. On the other hand, perhaps it is simply dedication and hard work at play.</p>
<h3>Draw for the science-minded freshman</h3>
<p>Victoria McElroy collected more than 45 soil samples before finding success, even driving off campus with her mother on her search. At the beginning of the course, she hadn&#8217;t known what to expect and found it rather nerve-wracking. She jumped on the learning curve from day one, picking up basic lab techniques such as pipetting. Now such skills are second nature, and she&#8217;s found herself in the lab at midnight, putting in hours for her favorite class.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait for Tuesdays and Thursdays,&#8221; says McElroy, 19, a Crown College MCD biology major.</p>
<p>Courses like Phage Genomics are a draw for future UCSC science-minded applicants. &#8220;Most other colleges don&#8217;t have the opportunity for freshmen to do research,&#8221; says Froud. The chance to conduct undergraduate research was a large factor in Froud&#8217;s decision to come to UCSC.</p>
<p>The UCSC course has been so successful that, although the three-year HHMI grant is ending, it will continue under UCSC (and possibly National Science Foundation) funding. From next year, it will be a two-quarter class offered to sophomores, reaching out to students early in their college education, but after they have taken basic biology and writing courses. Phage Genomics will add a scientific writing component, a musthave skill in the research world.</p>
<p>Phage expert William Jacobs of HHMI developed the original phage class for young students (&#8220;Phage Phinders&#8221;) when he worked with his local high school. Phage hunting, he says, is &#8220;a lifechanging experience even if you don&#8217;t go into research. You learn that you, a high school kid, can discover something new and unique.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his pioneering research, Jacobs used phages as tools to genetically manipulate mycobacteria, a technique that enabled a greater understanding of tuberculosis and other bacterial diseases.</p>
<p>Of the UCSC phage hunters, Jacobs says, &#8220;Anybody sequencing a phage is fine in my book. Just by using phages, we&#8217;re developing all the tools we need to manipulate TB. The trick to overcoming every obstacle, I found in a phage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two years after taking Phage Genomics, junior Kimberly Davis, 20 (Cowell, biochemistry and molecular biology), looks back on the experience as giving her a leg up in her science education. &#8220;For once I felt that what I was learning was important,&#8221; she says. Without the class, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be where I am now, doing my second year of research.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hartzog and Ares guide their students even after the course has ended, helping them find research opportunities on campus and hoping they go on to productive scientific careers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fun to do science!&#8221; Ares says. &#8220;We do it because we like it. And we want to give them the same feeling.&#8221;</p>

Molecular, cell and developmental professors Alan Zahler and Barry Bowman helm MARC and IMSD, respectively.</p>
<p>MARC is exclusively an undergraduate honors program, focusing on students who have an early commitment to graduate research. IMSD accepts undergrad and graduate students. Though separate, the programs share many resources, and a few students transfer from IMSD to MARC every year. MARC awardees receive a monthly stipend, while IMSD students are given an hourly salary.</p>
<p>MARC and IMSD are not simply financial aid. Programs staff director Malika Bell and assistant Yulianna Ortega offer both academic and personal support. The programs provide everything from equipment for printing conference posters to tutoring. The program staff know each student personally, and have even had students stay with them on occasion.</p>
<p>Shewit Tekeste (Oakes &#8216;08, MCD biology), now a third-year doctoral student at UCLA studying HIV proteins, credits her love of research to the program. The friendly environment, regular seminars, opportunities to attend national conferences, tutoring, and private meetings with Bell helped build her confidence as a young scientist, she says.</p>
<p>The success of these programs is reflected in the impressive achievements of their alumni. In the last five years, for example, 50 percent of MARC students have gone on to Ph.D. programs. Together, the programs are about to celebrate their 100th Ph.D. awarded.</p>
<p>Juan Noveron (Ph.D. &#8216;00, bioinorganic chemistry) benefited from both programs as a student, and calls them critical to his success. &#8221; As an undergraduate student, it allowed me to network with people in research careers and inspired me to pursue a college-level teaching career. As a graduate student, the MARC-IMSD program provided the financial support to focus on my research projects.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, as associate professor of chemistry at University of Texas at El Paso, Noveron works with his local MARC-IMSD program and young students just starting their scientific careers, paying forward the support he received at UCSC.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8dab932680727046006b54886c789634"><name>hellman-fellows1</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Gift establishes Hellman Fellows Program to support junior faculty</title><summary>The Hellman Fellows Fund has approved a gift of $625,000 to establish the UCSC Hellman Fellows Program.</summary><keywords>Hellman Fellows, Hellman Fellows Program</keywords><start-date>1303718400000</start-date><display-name>Hellman Fellows Program</display-name><path>/2011/04/hellman-fellows1</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/04/hellman-fellows1</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1303751922303</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1304448944683</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Hellman Fellows Fund has approved a gift of $625,000 to UC Santa Cruz to establish the UCSC Hellman Fellows Program, which will provide support for research by promising assistant professors who show capacity for great distinction in their research.</p>
<p>"Since we started this program seventeen years ago, I have had the opportunity to have lunch with hundreds of Hellman Fellows. To listen to what they accomplish and the potential of where their careers will take them is always a gratifying experience. Creating the Hellman Fellows Program is one of the best things my family has ever done with our giving," said Warren Hellman.</p>
<p>The awards are open to support assistant professors in all fields of study who have served two to three years at the assistant professor rank. Funding will be split roughly equally between assistant professors in two groups: engineering, physical sciences, and life sciences; and arts, humanities, and social sciences. The maximum award is $50,000, although most awards are expected to be in the $10,000 to $25,000 range.</p>
<p>"Junior faculty are often well-funded when first hired, but challenges arise in two to three years when start-up funding is exhausted and before first grants are obtained. We are grateful to the Hellman Fellows Fund for creating a program to assist promising young faculty at this point in their careers," said Herbie Lee, interim vice provost for academic affairs.</p>
<p>Awards may be used for any research-related expenses, including salaries for students or research assistants, equipment, or travel. Established in 1994 by Warren and Chris Hellman of San Francisco, the Hellman Fellows Program now supports junior faculty at 13 institutions, including nine UC campuses.</p>

(Photo by Jim MacKenzie)<br/></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Dan Heller looks into the future and sees creativity, innovation, and enough money to stop fretting about state budget cuts. <br/>
<br/>
"If we start building companies, we can replenish some of that lost revenue," he said. "If the school can rewrite its perception in the world as a place of innovation and entrepreneurship, we will attract even better students and even better faculty." <br/>
<br/>
Heller (College Eight '85, computer and information sciences) was a member of the e-mail vanguard (remember Zmail?) and is the executive director of the Center for Entrepreneurship at the Baskin School of Engineering. His job and the program are less than a year old, but he's aiming high: A focused academic program to incubate business and technology development, and technology licensing to attract cash and prestige to the campus. <br/>
<br/>
The City of Santa Cruz is watching the center's activities with interest. <br/>
<br/>
"It's essential to the local economy for us to support the commercialization of research as well as empower the entrepreneurial potential of the UCSC faculty," said Peter Koht (Stevenson '05, music and history), economic development coordinator for the City of Santa Cruz. "By creating the space for entrepreneurship, you create opportunity for resilience and innovation in an economy undergoing rapid transformation." <br/>
<br/>
The center is so young there's not yet any tie between it and the school's Silicon Valley Initiatives. <br/>
<br/>
In the early stages, Heller is focused on professionalizing the school's business plan design contest and working with faculty with innovative ideas. <br/>
<br/>
One idea that's already been patented is the brainchild of chemistry professor Rebecca Braslau, who invented a spray that, in conjunction with a basic fluorescent light, will detect the presence of poison oak and ivy oils on tools or clothing. <br/>
<br/>
"The methodology is patented to UCSC, but the development of the product to a level that it can be licensed or produced by a start-up company has not been pursued due to lack of funding, and lack of connections by the inventor&#8212;me," Braslau said. <br/>
<br/>
There are many researchers at UCSC with great ideas who are not interested or experienced in the business world, Braslau continued. <br/>
<br/>
With the center's help, Braslau hopes the many novel ideas germinating on campus will lead to great innovations in the market.

Goodman</image-alt><image-caption>Drew Goodman, Earthbound Farm (photo by r. r. jones)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Over the decades, UCSC has spawned a number of innovators with the help of a world-class faculty and an emphasis on an interdisciplinary education that gives students space to follow their muses.</p>
<p>And eight years after the university created Silicon Valley Initiatives, a true culture of entrepreneurial spirit has gripped the campus&#8212;thanks to an intentional focus on innovation, a growing crop of young entrepreneurs, and the stewardship of Silicon Valley veterans.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an opportune time to build our network and form the alliances that will really help boost our reputation and presence in the Valley,&#8221; said Gordon Ringold, head of Silicon Valley Initiatives, a set of educational and research activities that increase the presence of UC in Silicon Valley. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of intellectual capital we can tap into to bolster our resources in a challenged economic environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ringold, who earned his bachelor&#8217;s in biology from UCSC in 1972, became director last summer. A former professor at Stanford University, he has started a handful of companies in genetics and biofuels, including Codexis, which manipulates enzymes to improve the conversion of sugar cane into fuel. It&#8217;s based on technology&#8212; also created by a Ringold company&#8212;used to heighten drug performance.</p>
<p>For Silicon Valley Initiatives, Ringold is focused on the big industries on the peninsula and the South Bay: computer science, computer engineering, and material sciences. Of course, if Silicon Valley Initiatives is to be a nexus of innovation between the Valley and the campus, there has to be something to connect.</p>
<p>Enter the <a href="review-spring-2011-center-for-entrepreneurship.xml">Center for Entrepreneurship</a>, a campus outfit born last fall and, just as important, a growing cadre of UCSC grads gaining influence in Silicon Valley, the Bay Area, and beyond.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cohort of UC Santa Cruz alums who are entrepreneurs in the Valley has really started to grow,&#8221; Ringold said. &#8220;Because of that, we can tap into a network that even five or 10 years ago would have been harder to accomplish. There aren&#8217;t many of us who have been around for a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>But alumni with fewer gray hairs than Ringold are making names for themselves in a broad array of fields, everything from farming to pharmaceutical to bikes and Internet mapping.</p>
<p>We feature four of them:</p>
<h3>Brandon Allgood and Nigel Duffy, Numerate</h3>
<p>Brandon Allgood and Nigel Duffy radiate confidence. According to Allgood, who earned a master&#8217;s degree in physics from UCSC in 2001 and a Ph.D. in 2005, their use of the cloud&#8212;a network of computers linked in cyberspace&#8212;is &#8220;a fundamental paradigm shift&#8221; in pharmaceutical design.</p>
<p>In traditional drug development, researchers make incremental changes to chemical compounds and wait to see if the effects are good, bad, or indifferent.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.numerate.com">Numerate</a>, based in San Mateo, uses a network of up to 2,000 computers to conduct simultaneous virtual screenings of chemical combinations to find what works, much faster and cheaper than the old ways, the company says.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve solved the problem of getting a computer to design a small molecule,&#8221; said Duffy, who obtained his doctorate in computer science in 2001 at UCSC. &#8220;We partner with people with insight into what a therapeutic should do to treat a disease, and we deliver to them molecules that implement their biological insight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allgood and Duffy work with some big pharmaceutical companies they can&#8217;t name publicly and universities including Stanford and Cornell. They&#8217;re excited at the prospect of more technology licensing and development at UCSC, and Allgood will use his new position on the UC Santa Cruz Foundation board to fan the entrepreneurial flames.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an overall creativity you find at UCSC you don&#8217;t find at other places,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It lends itself to thinking outside the box, which is an absolute necessity for an innovator.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Bernt Wahl, Factle</h3>
<p>Anyone who&#8217;s ever obsessed over ZIP code prestige has a friend in Bernt Wahl. So do real estate agents.</p>
<p>Wahl (Crown &#8216;86, mathematics and physics) lives in Berkeley and teaches entrepreneurship to engineers at UC Berkeley. He&#8217;s also CEO of <a href="http://factle.com">Factle</a>, which specializes in hyperlocal mapping and location intelligence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was involved in search engines,&#8221; Wahl said by way of explaining the germination of Factle and his failed attempt to take over the former search engine Infoseek. &#8220;I noticed that things were getting more hyperlocal. I consulted with a real estate company, breaking down regions into smaller units.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cities were fine, but nobody had aggregated the neighborhood boundary data. We pioneered it.&#8221;</p>
<div class="callout-left narrow">
<h3>Center cultivates innovation to propagate home-grown businesses</h3>
<p>A focused academic program to incubate business and technology development, and technology licensing to attract cash and prestige to the campus. <a href="review-spring-2011-center-for-entrepreneurship.xml">Read more</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Factle&#8217;s technology allows searches so granular they take a lot of guesswork, and legwork, out of the home-buying process. For example, a house hunter who loses out on a home in a particular San Francisco neighborhood can get an e-mail alert the moment another house in the same area goes on the market. The technology is malleable enough to do foreclosure or public health analysis, and track damages and repairs house by house after a catastrophe like last summer&#8217;s San Bruno pipeline explosion or the March earthquake and tsunami in Japan.</p>
<p>How valuable can Wahl be to UCSC&#8217;s efforts to promote innovation on campus? Well, earlier this year he was one of 350 entrepreneurs from around the world invited to an event at the United Nations in New York, and he scored an invite to dinner with the Rockefellers along with his college buddies, one of whom created a search algorithm Microsoft bought and named Bing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was pretty interesting,&#8221; he said of the dinner. &#8220;I learned that the pool room isn&#8217;t the billiards room. It actually has a pool in it.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Rob Forbes, PUBLIC</h3>
<p>Already known for starting Design Within Reach, the avant-garde-gonemainstream furniture store launched as a web-direct business in 1999, Rob Forbes now has &#8220;a mission to bring the same level of intensity, education, and value to our public spaces and cities as DWR has brought to our personal and private environments.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the web site for his urban bike design company <a href="http://publicbikes.com">PUBLIC</a> makes clear, the people at the company don&#8217;t hate cars&#8212;they just want bikes to overtake cars as the preferred American way of getting around.</p>
<p>They aim to take back public spaces with bikes affordable enough to fit middle-class budgets and cool enough to be used on the Google and Apple campuses. It&#8217;s exactly the kind of company that would be operated by someone who graduated with a degree in aesthetic studies from Porter College (1974). And to hear Forbes tell it, every bike he sells is a consumer good and a purchase for the public good.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe the quality and usage of our public spaces is the measure of the success of our democracy,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h3>Drew Goodman, Earthbound Farm</h3>
<p>Drew Goodman and his wife Myra didn&#8217;t start <a href="http://www.ebfarm.com">Earthbound Farm</a> in Carmel Valley on a whim, but it was close.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started the farm based on the romantic notion of living on a farm,&#8221; the New York City native said. &#8220;That it would be fun before we got on with our career thing. We ended up staying and pursuing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And a little raspberry patch they tended in exchange for free rent is now the second-biggest organic vegetable brand in the country. It&#8217;s a development Goodman (College Eight &#8216;83, environmental studies and environmental design) attributes to their innate tenacity and the values he absorbed on the UCSC campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an entrepreneur, you need to think through where you&#8217;re going, but at some point you need to take the plunge and know you&#8217;re going to be able to navigate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For those with the appetite, it&#8217;s fall down seven times and pick yourself up eight. You have to feel like you&#8217;re going to figure it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as UCSC evolves into an entrepreneurminded institution, Goodman thinks it&#8217;s the logical leader of &#8220;do good and do well&#8221; business.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a great opportunity for entrepreneurs to finance businesses that can help push us to a more sustainable way of doing things and making money in the process,&#8221; Goodman said. &#8220;It would be nice to see UCSC take the lead in that.&#8221;</p>

<br/>
Like millions of other young Arabs, Mohammad Bouazizi, age 26, had been repeatedly humiliated. <br/>
<br/>
He could not find a decent job. <br/>
<br/>
To survive, he sold vegetables on the street of the Tunisian town of Sidi Bouzid. <br/>
<br/>
The authorities repeatedly harassed and abused him. Finally, he immolated himself in protest on December 17, 2010. <br/>
<br/>
And thus the match was lit and touched to the tinder of a young, savvy, and enraged generation. The fire spread, as other youth in the town protested against penury and oppression, corruption and humiliation. The regime resorted to violence&#8212; but the rebels were undeterred. The revolt spread to the capital, Tunis, and after weeks of demonstrations, the dictator Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia in February. <br/>
<br/>
Critically, this generational revolt spread next to Egypt, home of one-third of all Arabs. Years of struggle and organizing by opposition movements, liberal, socialist, and Islamist, culminated in the dramatic 18 days in which the corrupt, brutal regime of Hosni Mubarak was toppled. Similar revolts have spread (as of this writing) to Bahrain, Oman, Yemen, and Libya, as well as to Morocco, Algeria, Jordan, Iraq, and Iran. <br/>
<br/>
Why did this happen? What are its implications for Americans? Two kinds of causes may be identified&#8212;immediate ("sparks") and structural ("tinder"). The sparks are sketched above&#8212;and a key component, in each case, is the triumph over fear&#8212;when an illegitimate, widely despised regime resorts to violence, and the protestors refuse to back down, the regime is doomed. <br/>
<br/>
Structural causes are numerous. They include the fact that some 60 percent of Arabs today are younger than 30. They are by far the most educated generation in the region's history. Millions are unemployed, and food prices are rising. In both Tunisia and Egypt, the revolutions of 2011 were preceded&#8212;and accompanied by&#8212;widespread labor protests. <br/>
<br/>
Most fundamentally, however, most Arabs despise their regimes&#8212;for their corruption, nepotism, violence, and complicity in American and Israeli abuses of power. Arab dictators have humiliated their peoples for decades. Finally, when the spark was struck, the tinder ignited. Modern social media facilitated the spread of revolt. <br/>
<br/>
In today's world, everyone knows what is going on, everywhere. <br/>
<br/>
Some say that today's Arab revolution confronts Americans with a choice between our values and our interests. Our values are, of course, democratic. But Arab democracy does <em>not</em> threaten our "interests," <em>if</em> "our interests" are the interests of the vast majority of Americans, rather than those of the (very well-heeled) minorities that profit from an Empire of foreign bases, pretensions to "control oil," and mindless support of unsustainable Israeli occupation policies. <br/>
<br/>
From conflating Arab nationalists with friends of the USSR during the Cold War to positing non-existent WMD in Iraq, the U.S. record of interventions in the region is one of countering threats that did not <em>in fact</em> exist. Arab democracy is no threat. On the contrary, the revolt of Arab youth against humiliation should make anyone pledging allegiance to the principles of 1776 very proud, indeed. <br/>
<br/>
Moments such as the present where many vectors of change come together in unpredictable ways are fraught with peril. This is no time for ill-conceived U.S. interventions, which can seriously harm our long-term interests. In the face of this massive uncertainty and unpredictability, we should recall the Hippocratic Oath: "First do no harm."

<br/>
Gliessman was teaching at the Colegio Superior de Agricultura Tropical in Tabasco, Mexico, and studying the traditional Mayan techniques that form the foundation of sustainable small-scale farming that respects the land, farmers, and their culture. <br/>
<br/>
Three years later, in 1980, Gliessman joined the UC Santa Cruz environmental studies faculty and founded the UCSC Agroecology Program. In 1997, he wrote the textbook <em>Agroecology: The Ecology of Sustainable Food Systems</em> and published a second edition 10 years later. Today, agroecology is an interdisciplinary concept that extends beyond organic farming, and is widely known and taught in universities (often using Gliessman's textbook) across the nation and around the world. <br/>
<br/>
"Steve is one of the pioneers and founders of agroecology worldwide," said professor Miguel Altieri at UC Berkeley's Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management. "His influence has been enormous." <br/>
<br/>
Said another colleague, Professor Charles A. Francis, director of the Center for Sustainable Agricultural Systems at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln: "Three decades ago, agroecology was a little known idea in the minds of a few academics in Latin America, the U.S., and Germany. Through his writing and teaching, Steve became one of the most prolific and articulate advocates of this confluence of agriculture and ecology." <br/>
<br/>
Today, Gliessman, holder of the first endowed chair at UC Santa Cruz, the Ruth and Alfred E. Heller Chair in Agroecology, is scaling back ever so slightly. After all, he is supposed to be retired as of last July. But that hasn't seemed to slow him down. <br/>
<br/>
He spent two weeks teaching in Spain this winter. He's organizing the 12th annual International Agroecology Shortcourse that will bring 35 to 40 participants from around the world to UCSC in July for two weeks of intensive instruction and practice in transforming food systems from field to table. <br/>
<br/>
He continues to be editor-in-chief of the <em>Journal of Sustainable Agriculture,</em> and his <em>Agroecology</em> publisher is lobbying hard for a third edition because the book is selling better than ever. <br/>
<br/>
Gliessman's dream of establishing a "green kitchen" at the Program in Community and Agroecology (PICA), where he has focused his attention since 2002, is nearing fruition. Located at the Sustainable Living Center in UCSC's lower quarry, PICA brings students from diverse disciplines to live in a community where they learn firsthand the principles of sustainable agriculture through classroom learning and community gardens. <br/>
<br/>
The modular kitchen building will demonstrate the latest in green building, alternative energy, and reducing the carbon footprint, Gliessman says. He envisions it as a sustainable living laboratory for students from multiple majors to experience, learn about, and even research sustainable technologies. <br/>
<br/>
Sustainability, as Gliessman defines it, is an approach to life based on treating the land in an ecologically sound way. It must also encompass a just system socially and economically that treats people, land, animals, and water in "a way that lasts forever." <br/>
<br/>
"It's about healthy food, healthy land, and healthy people," he says, "and it's going to require some social changes. <br/>
<br/>
"Social change doesn't happen overnight," Gliessman notes. The goal, he says, "is to create transformative action and a whole new way of thinking about the entire food system."<br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8ebc3e7180727046006b5488c8158de9"><name>denim-day</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Denim Day is April 27: Wear your jeans</title><summary>Take a stand against rape, sexual assault and dating violence.</summary><keywords>denim day, SAFE</keywords><start-date>1303718400000</start-date><display-name>Denim Day is April 27</display-name><path>/2011/04/denim-day</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/04/denim-day</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1303769792008</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1303769874039</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Make a social statement with your fashion statement. Take a stand against rape, sexual assault and dating violence.&#160; Denim Day at UCSC will be held on Wednesday, April 27. This campaign gives people the chance to make a social statement with their fashion statement while supporting survivors of sexual assault and spreading awareness about sexual violence. <br/>
<br/>
Organized by SAFE (Sexual Assault Facts &amp; Education) at SHOP (Student Health Outreach &amp; Promotion), Denim Day recalls an Italian court case that sparked international outrage when judges did not convict a rapist because the victim wore jeans. The judge ruled that because the victim was wearing tight jeans, she must have helped her attacker remove them, thus implying consent. <br/>
<br/>
Since then, Denim Day has grown to become a national movement held annually during April, which is Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Every 2 minutes, someone is sexually assaulted in the U.S. Our goal is to raise awareness and to erase misconceptions about sexual violence so we can work to prevent it.

This is partly because I grew up in an Iranian family, and Iranians, generally, don't believe in "just writing," unless the kind of writing in question is poetry, and you happen to have the talent of Rumi. Ordinary mortals who wished to write should become something else first&#8212;perhaps a nuclear physicist or a heart surgeon&#8212;and then do their writing on the side. <br/>
<br/>
This rather stern view rested on the belief, not altogether mistaken, that society needed us to contribute much more than our thoughts on paper, and that in the process of learning and practicing a craft, we would be accumulating the insight and experience that would enrich our writing. <br/>
<br/>
I chafed at that cultural logic at the time, but it turned out to be not so particularly or tediously Iranian as I thought. The literature I encountered for the first time at UCSC, in the core course of Oakes College, reflected a similarly demanding and activist view of the writer's place in the world. It was first at Oakes, and later in other classes, that I recognized and began to understand all the inchoate feelings that had underpinned my growing up Iranian in America. The fashionable shorthand for this process was "consciousness raising" and its effect on me was profound and electric. <br/>
<br/>
I suddenly had an intellectual language to consider all that had befallen my family and my country; I was able to articulate in a terse, 200-word paragraph why I grew up despising Sally Field (she had starred in the crudely anti-Iranian film <em>Not Without My Daughter</em>). My core course instructor, Dave Dodson, was the mentor whose approach helped ground me as I took this new awareness out into the disciplines that had always attracted me. In his classroom I learned what a potent tool writing could be in narrating, and thus owning, my experience in America. I also learned to value humility, and in the process, how to avoid the navel-gazing and self-righteousness that would get in the way of people wanting to hear my story. <br/>
<br/>
If at Oakes I was inspired with the political power of a tale, then it was at <em>City on a Hill Press,</em> under the tutelage of writing instructor Conn "Ringo" Hallinan, my adviser at the paper, where I learned how to craft a story. By the time I arrived at the newspaper, I had already endured the kind of rigorous editing in literature classes that had beaten out all the highschool laziness in my writing. I learned in those literature classes the painstaking, sentence-by-sentence crafting of a polished piece of a work. It was under Ringo that I learned to love the genre that would become my life's work: literary journalism. A news story, Ringo taught us, is a formula anyone can learn. It's the long form journalism that is intellectually vibrant, that makes a contribution to history, that elevates reporters to writers. This belief inspired me to become a journalist and to write books "on the side," a career that has managed to fulfill both me and that pesky Iranian dictum.

<br/>
How can a robust global economy fail? And what are the factors that can bring it crashing down? <br/>
<br/>
Three decades later, the political and economic landscape of the world had changed dramatically. The global economy had expanded beyond Bruce's wildest imagination. Meanwhile, intangible securities known as derivatives were playing a much more decisive role in economic expansion. The excesses of communism had been dealt with, and Bruce realized it was time to deal with the excesses of capitalism and the challenges of fairness and justice. <br/>
<br/>
With these factors in mind, Bruce posed his most ambitious question to date: How can the latest economic crisis challenge our assumptions about capitalism? For the past two years, Bruce (Cowell '79, economics) has brought international scholars to UCSC to discuss the global economic crisis as part of the Bruce Initiative on Rethinking Capitalism. The conference returned to campus April 7&#8211;9. <br/>
<br/>
It makes perfect sense that the campus that inspired him is now "neutral territory" where professors from different universities are happy to put aside rivalries, shake hands, and talk. The multidisciplinary approach of the campus's curriculum also makes it the perfect place to host an eclectic mix of scholars whose disciplines include economics, accounting, finance, and political science as well as anthropology, geology, literature, art, and public policy. <br/>
<br/>
"We could have easily done it in San Jose, but we wanted to have it in Santa Cruz," Bruce said. "We wanted to have the students involved." <br/>
<br/>
The conference is only the latest in Bruce's collaborations with his alma mater. Bruce increased his involvement with UC Santa Cruz after he sold his successful asset management firm five years ago. <br/>
<br/>
His contributions have included initiatives as diverse as helping the Center for Integrated Water Research bring a reverse osmosis water treatment unit to the city of Watsonville to sponsoring a two-year lecture series as part of the South Asia Studies Initiative and supporting aspiring math and science teachers along with promising graduate students in politics. He is even working with the Center for Games and Playable Media to create a video game focusing on environmental issues and the ocean. <br/>
<br/>
Bruce's first creation was the establishment of the Mark Bruce Fellowship for Math and Science Teachers at UCSC in honor of his brother, who died in the World Trade Center attacks on 9/11. His support includes the purchase of classroom supplies in under-resourced schools in Watsonville and Salinas. <br/>
<br/>
Bruce also established the Robert Meister Scholars Fund to support graduate students in politics and bring the "best and the brightest" to UCSC. His $250,000 gift in 2006 funds a $50,000 fellowship that has been awarded three times so far. <br/>
<br/>
To date, Bruce has given more than $1 million to UCSC. <br/>
<br/>
Along the way, Bruce has contributed yet another valuable resource: his time and expertise. For three years he served as chair of the Board of Councilors, an advisory group to Division of Social Sciences Dean Sheldon Kamieniecki. <br/>
<br/>
Now Bruce is helping to guide the campus's comprehensive campaign effort while serving on the advisory board for the Santa Cruz Institute for International Economics, the South Asia Studies Initiative, and the Sury Initiative for Global Finance and International Risk Management. <br/>
<br/>
His advice for other alumni: Re-establish your old links to the campus. Rekindle old mentorships. If possible, show up there in person. Get involved. Contribute in a way that will drive and inspire future generations. <br/>
<br/>
"They should hunt down old professors, talk to students, fund a scholarship, or fund a speaker series," Bruce said. "It's so easy to get engaged." <br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8eff7d1e80727046006b54884b612dc4"><name>campus-earth-summit</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus Earth Summit keeps sustainable conversations going</title><summary>The all-student organized Earth Summit on April 22, now in its 10th year, brought together students, faculty, staff, and community members to share ideas and strategize on how to transform UCSC into a sustainable campus.</summary><keywords>uc, ucsc. uc santa cruz, earth summit, sustainability, student environmental center, ideass</keywords><start-date>1303718400000</start-date><display-name>2011 Campus Earth Summit</display-name><path>/2011/04/campus-earth-summit</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/04/campus-earth-summit</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1303774198972</created-on><last-modified-by>nespatel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1319229153217</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/04/images/earth-summit-1-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/04/images/earth-summit-1-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>earth-summit-1-300.jpg</name><display-name>earth-summit-1-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>126641</file-size><width>300</width><height>256</height></image><image-alt>Dora Bromme and Nikki Fiore</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/04/images/EarthWeek80thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/04/images/EarthWeek80thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>EarthWeek80thumb.jpg</name><display-name>EarthWeek80thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19583</file-size><width>80</width><height>79</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>earthweek logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Dora Bromme, a three-year resident of the Program in Community and Agroecology at UC Santa Cruz, right, discusses ways to work together with Nikki Fiore, a member of Students for Ongoing Solutions.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/04/images/keeley-fred-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/04/images/keeley-fred-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>keeley-fred-300.jpg</name><display-name>keeley-fred-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>118300</file-size><width>300</width><height>224</height></image><image-alt>Fred Keeley</image-alt><image-caption>Fred Keeley delivers a keynote speech at the 10th Annual Campus Earth Summit.</image-caption></secondary-images><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/04/images/earth-summit-2-200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/04/images/earth-summit-2-200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>earth-summit-2-200.jpg</name><display-name>earth-summit-2-200.jpg</display-name><file-size>130813</file-size><width>225</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt>recycling bin illsutrates waste stream</image-alt><image-caption>A display using a recycling bin graphically depicts the waste stream generated by UC Santa Cruz housing residents.

<br/>
The result was "everyone had a chance to give input on all 10 topic areas," said Tyler Pitts, a 2010 graduate in environmental studies, who is working as a coordinator with the Student Environmental Center on the Blueprint for a Sustainable Campus.<br/>
<br/>
The all-student organized Earth Summit on April 22, now in its 10th year, brought together students, faculty, staff, and community members to share ideas and strategize on how to transform UCSC into a sustainable campus.<br/>
<br/>
One of those impromptu conversations came when Dora Bromme, a senior literature major, explained to Nikki Fiore how the <a href="http://ucscpica.org/">Program in Community and Agroecology</a> (PICA) works.<br/>
<br/>
Fiore, a second-year environmental studies and biology major at College 8, visited PICAs table from a table she staffed nearby for Students for Ongoing Solutions, a group that works to establish community gardens across campus.&#160; The result is a plan on how they can work together on an upcoming "green chef" competition patterned after Iron Chef of television fame &#8211; but sustainable.<br/>
<br/>
Visiting the Earth Summit on Earth Day this year was a contingent from the University of Hawaii's West Oahu campus. Joe Mobley, the interim vice chancellor for academic affairs, explained he and his colleagues are looking for sustainable ideas as they build out their campus. "I'm very impressed with what you guys are doing in Santa Cruz," Mobley said.<br/>
<br/>
Also staffing a table, Kimberly Keil-Naji, a Santa Cruz resident representing Office Max, handed out canvas bags, biodegradable pens and plantable bookmarks with wildflower seeds. "I love this program," she said of the Earth Summit. "I've watched it grow each year."<br/>
<br/>
Environmental Studies professor James Barsimantov distributed information seeking interns for IDEASS -- "Impact Designs: Engineering and Sustainability through Student Service." The program is designed to enhance science, technology, engineering, and mathematics skills and has weathered the tough first year of getting established. Information is available by clicking the <a href="http://sustainability.ucsc.edu/sustainability.ucsc.edu/ideass">IDEASS tab</a> at <a href="http://sustainability.ucsc.edu/">sustainability.ucsc.edu</a>. Deadline for applications is May 20.<br/>
<br/>
Keynote speaker Fred Keeley, former assemblymember, current Santa Cruz County treasurer, and longtime environmentalist, focused his remarks on the issue of global climate change. "No issue has moved from the fringes of public policy to the centerpiece of a national and international dialog" as quickly, he said.<br/>
<br/>

<p>Previously, the building earned the campus its first "Gold" certification from LEED [Leadership and Environmental Energy Development], a non-profit trade organization that promotes sustainability in the design, construction and daily operation of buildings.</p>
<p>That recognition was the end result of a four-year,&#160; $17 million project to expand and seismically retrofit the 42-year-old health center, while making the building more energy efficient and environmentally friendly. Now, the Structural Engineers Association of Northern California has selected the health center for a merit award in the category of sustainable design.</p>
<p>The jury of five members included two structural engineers, a structural engineering professor, a general contractor and an architect. They evaluated 27 entries in eight categories.</p>
<p>The SEAONC 2011 Excellence in Structural Engineering Awards will be presented in early May.</p>
<p>Degenkolb Engineers from San Francisco were responsible for the Cowell Student Health Center seismic upgrades of the existing building and the structural design of the new east wing addition.</p>
<p>The entire project was funded by UCSC students through several bond measures, including Measure 35,&#160; which raised $1.25 million to pay for eco-friendly additions to the building.</p>
<p>The students raised this money by agreeing to a new compulsory fee of $5.20 per quarter per student.</p>
<p>Late in the design process, UCSC made major changes.&#160;&#160; Among the additions and improvements: waterless urinals and more efficient flush toilets; planter boxes to capture storm water; reinforced turf instead of pavement in a turnaround area for service vehicles; recycled and other green building materials; the use of FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified wood and the use of &#8220;green&#8221; finishes on the floors.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="92d095bb80727046006b54881dc17041"><name>review-spring-2011-letters-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Letters policy</title><summary>Review welcomes letters and publishes them in its online and print editions; please read our policy. </summary><start-date>1303977600000</start-date><display-name>Letters policy</display-name><path>/2011/04/review-spring-2011-letters-policy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/04/review-spring-2011-letters-policy</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1303838233945</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenm</last-modified-by><last-modified>1304461811091</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Letters</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>Review</em> welcomes letters and publishes them in its online and print editions.</p>

<p class="Style8">UC Santa Cruz is piling up so many high-profile sustainability rankings and honors that it&#8217;s easy to lose track of them all.</p>
<p class="Style8">But UCSC&#8217;s latest recognition, in the Princeton Review&#8217;s newly published &#8220;green colleges&#8221; guidebook, is more than just another honor. &#160;It&#8217;s also a history of successful green-energy projects on campus.</p>
<p class="Style8">The Princeton Review has given the campus a prominent, detailed and highly complimentary entry in <em>The Princeton Review's Guide to 311 Green Colleges: 2011 Edition,</em> which profiles 308 eco-friendly colleges and universities in the United States and three in Canada.</p>
<p class="Style8">Released on Earth Day, the publication includes a 273-word descriptive paragraph about UCSC&#8217;s work to minimize environmental impact and increase efficiency, and the green-energy recognition it has received over the past few years.</p>
<p class="Style8">For starters, the article mentions &#8220;the campus boasts a 70 percent waste-diversion rate and gets 10 percent of its energy from renewable sources.&#8221; Then the Green Colleges guide praises UCSC for slashing greenhouse gas emissions, &#8220;greening its design &#8230; and integrating sustainability at every institutional level.&#8221;</p>
<p class="Style8">The Princeton Review is best known for standardized test preparation services and college admissions consulting, but it&#8217;s also known for its highly publicized rankings of colleges across the United States.</p>
<p class="Style8">The publication walks the reader through a long list of previous recognitions. Among those honors is UCSC&#8217;s inclusion on the Sierra Club&#8217;s top 20 list of the &#8220;Coolest (greenest) Schools&#8221; in 2009 and 2010, and the Environmental Protection Agency naming UCSC on its list of the nation&#8217;s largest campus purchasers of &#8220;green&#8221; energy for the last several consecutive years. UCSC remains on the EPA&#8217;s top 10 list.</p>
<p class="Style8">The book also mentions that the Chuck Haugen Conservation Fund, dedicated to preserving ecosystems in and around the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, named the UCSC Arboretum nonprofit of the year in 2008.</p>
<p class="Style8">The publication singles out the campus Sustainability Office for special praise, mentioning its project idea database, which includes suggestions by students, faculty, and staff to improve sustainable practices on campus, while encouraging students to apply for $10,000 grants via the College FilterForGood Eco-Challenge.</p>
<p class="Style8">The article also includes a long list of influential student-staffed organizations on campus: the Student Environmental Center, Friends of the Community Agroecology Network, the Campus Sustainability Council, the California Public Interest Research Group, the Green Campus Program, California Student Sustainability Coalition, Education for Sustainable Living Program, Environmental Media Project, and the Program in Community and Agroecology.</p>
<p class="Style8">In closing, the Princeton Review praises UCSC faculty and students for winning awards for sustainability-focused projects and research.</p>
<p class="Style8">According to the Princeton Review, all of the included universities and colleges &#8220;demonstrate notable commitments to sustainability in their academic offerings, campus infrastructure, activities and career preparation.&#8221;</p>

Three male students and one female student were walking to a bus stop on Bay Street when they were approached by four males. One man showed a knife and demanded their money. The robbers took an iPod from one victim and a wallet from another.<br/>
 <br/>
 The robbers were described as a black male, a Hispanic male and two white males. The black male was approximately 6&#8217; tall with a backward cap, muscular build and a thin mustache. The Hispanic male was about 5&#8217;8&#8221; tall with a medium build, long hair and a gray hat. The two white males were between 5&#8217;10&#8221; and 6&#8217; and weighed between 150 and 160 lbs. The suspects fled in a mid-size gray 4-door sedan with a loud exhaust. It is unknown at this time if this robbery is connected with other recent robberies.<br/>

Can it be proven? "The answer is yes, it helps, overwhelmingly," says Thomas F. Pettigrew, social psychology research professor at UC Santa Cruz. <br/>
<br/>
In a new book, <em>When Groups Meet: the Dynamics of Intergroup Contact</em> (Psychology Press, 2011), Pettigrew, an international expert on racism, and Linda R. Tropp, associate professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, analyze research that shows how bringing groups together can mitigate prejudice. <br/>
<br/>
Pettigrew and Tropp, who received her Ph.D. in psychology from UCSC in 2001, painstakingly sifted through 1,400 published research papers on contact theory, narrowing their focus to 515 involving more than 250,000 subjects in 38 countries. Their work is the first meta-analysis to synthesize research on some of the most bedeviling social problems in the world &#8211; conflict between groups, racial, ethnic, religious, regional, economic, and social. <br/>
<br/>
Intergroup contact is any kind of contact, Pettigrew explained. "The deaf and the hearing, the blind and the sighted, as well as race and ethnicity," he said. <br/>
<br/>
The project began in 1998 at UCSC.&#160; Pettigrew and Tropp first published their findings in an article in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em> in 2006 that since has become one of the most widely cited. The book adds new work including research Pettigrew has analyzed from Philipps-Universit&#228;t in Marburg, Germany.<br/>
<br/>
Pettigrew joined UCSC in 1980, retired 14 years later, then returned to teach courses for another six years. In 2009, he received the UC-systemwide Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award given for accomplishments since retirement. <br/>
<br/>
Pettigrew said he expected the research to show that contact helps reduce tensions but was surprised at how overwhelming the data was. "It was a bigger effect than I thought."<br/>
<br/>
Some of the best work being done on contact theory over the last 20 years is at Philipps-Universit&#228;t, Pettigrew said. He's been able to review the German probability surveys on prejudice in an effort to determine when contact works best and why it works.<br/>
<br/>
"Friendship is the most important kind, as you might expect, though others have shown that friends of a friend can have an effect," he said. <br/>
<br/>
There are times when personal contact does not defuse tension, Pettigrew said, and that is when threat is involved. He offered as an example Israeli army checkpoints in the occupied West Bank. <br/>
<br/>
The presence of both the soldiers and the citizens at the checkpoint is not voluntary, he said. "Soldiers don't want to be there. They are scared to death. Palestinians are not happy having a checkpoint in their territory, it's humiliating and the soldiers are carrying guns.<br/>
<br/>
"That's not the kind of contact that can lead to better relations," he said. <br/>

But with her most recent book, <em>Developing Destinies: A Mayan Midwife and Town</em> (Oxford University Press, 2011) the project chose her.</p>
<p>The book is part memoir, part ethnography, part research study in child developmental psychology. It's also clearly a labor of love for the UCSC Foundation Distinguished Research Professor of Psychology at UC Santa Cruz. It's also been a long labor, the result of 20 years gestation and the culmination of research dating back to the mid 1970s.</p>
<p class="callout-left"><strong>Rogoff will present a reading from her book at the Bay Tree Bookstore at noon on May 12.</strong></p>
<p>Labor and love figure prominently, as do destiny and development. In 1974, Rogoff, then a graduate student, was hired to give cognitive tests to children in the Mayan town of San Pedro la Laguna, Guatemala. There she met and interviewed Encarnaci&#243;n (Chona) P&#233;rez Gonz&#225;lez, a prominent and renowned sacred Mayan midwife, then nearly 50. In the Mayan culture, sacred midwives, known as <em>iyoom</em>, are identified at birth by the midwife who delivers them, who notifies the family that this is the baby&#8217;s destiny.</p>
<p>As a developmental psychologist, Rogoff interviewed Chona as the town&#8217;s leading childrearing expert. "When I first interviewed her about childrearing, I noticed her hands and commented 'your hands look just like my mother's,'" Rogoff recalls. "She replied, "That's because I <em>am</em> your mother.'" Chona recounts to others in San Pedro that she gave birth to Rogoff. The result is a "mother and daughter relationship" that has spanned the decades, one that has given Rogoff intimate access to the traditional practices of midwifery.&#8232;&#8232; Rogoff has returned to the little town on the shores of Lake Atitlan nearly every year since that first visit except for a decade when her own children were young and violent political turmoil made it too dangerous.</p>
<p><em>Developing Destinies</em> contains 90 photographs, many of Rogoff&#8217;s own, but also a trove dating back to 1941 taken by anthropologists Lois and Ben Paul, which includes photographs of Chona as a young woman. The photographs and narrative document the changes to the town and its residents over more than 70 years as modernity crept in.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, Rogoff and Chona decided to write the book. "The project kind of came along and said 'you need to do this,'" Rogoff said. At first she wanted to paint watercolors of the town and people to illustrate a children's book.&#160; But it soon became clear it wasn't a children's book and "gradually morphed into a book for a broad range of adult readers, including the general public.&#8221;</p>
<p>"It was a side project for most of that time," Rogoff said. "I didn't see it as something directly connected to my central work until recently." But each year when she returned to San Pedro the project "reminded me, and I'd ask more questions."</p>
<p>As she writes: "The story kept insisting on being written."</p>
<p>Rogoff wrote the book with Chona (though she can neither read nor write)&#160; and Chona's granddaughter, Chonita Chavajay Quiaca&#237;n, also born to be a sacred midwife, and grandson, Josu&#233; Chavajay Quiaca&#237;n, a sociologist.</p>
<p>Rogoff still has close ties to the town, she founded the town library, and helped develop an Internet learning center. Royalties from book sales will benefit the learning center and other projects in the town.</p>
<p>She plans to return to San Pedro in June and will present the book at the learning center. It is published only in English at this point but translations into Spanish and the Mayan language Tz'utujil are planned.</p>
<p>She's even thinking of setting up a little table in the town market. "People can come along and see the book. They won't be able to read it but they'll be able to see the photos, which people from San Pedro regard as an important local archive."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a261ac0780727046006b548811fed221"><name>staff appreciation reminder</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Reminder: Staff Appreciation Picnic Tuesday, May 10th </title><summary>The Staff Advisory Board would like to remind all UCSC staff members that the staff appreciation picnic will be May 10th, 2011, starting at 11:30 a.m. on the East Field.</summary><keywords>staff appreciation picnic</keywords><start-date>1304064000000</start-date><display-name>Picnic Reminder</display-name><path>/2011/04/staff appreciation reminder</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/04/staff appreciation reminder</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1304099400604</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1304099455875</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>The Staff Advisory Board would like to remind all UCSC staff members that the staff appreciation picnic will be May 10th, 2011, starting at 11:30 a.m. on the East Field. <br/>

<br/>
Steve Bruce, the UC Santa Cruz economics graduate who founded the <a href="http://rethinkingcapitalism.ucsc.edu/">Bruce Initiative on Rethinking Capitalism</a>, said he was very pleased with how the conference turned out, noting that roughly half the audience was from the Santa Cruz area. "The high turnout shows that there is an interested community that looks to the university for information," Bruce said.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Bob Meister, the professor of political and social thought who directs the Bruce Initiative, concurred. "The really gratifying change [from the first conference last year] was the intensity of the participation of the town, and the thoughtful and dedicated responses," he said. "We couldn't have accommodated more."<br/>
<br/>
In welcoming remarks, UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal, thanked the participants for attending and noted that the conference "follows in the footsteps of our founders, who imagined a place where the brightest minds would take the initiative to ask the big questions that benefit society."<br/>
<br/>
Horace "Woody" Brock kicked off the conference Thursday evening (April 7) with a talk that framed the issues on tap for discussion. At times pointed and funny, Brock, an economic strategist and president of Strategic Economic Decisions, emphasized that the economic system in which we live today is not capitalism.<br/>
<br/>
"Capitalism is the most remarkable institution devised but you won't recognize it because you don't have it," he said. "In Adam Smith's capitalism there is no finance,"<br/>
he said, offering one example. Under theoretically pure capitalism there would be no Goldman Sachs, Brock said, nor labor unions.<br/>
<br/>
Meister said a key benefit of the conference is the bringing together of some of the top minds in the world today, many of whom hadn't met before. The three days forge exchanges of ideas and new collaborations, he said.<br/>
<br/>
"I didn't know these people and didn't know what it would be like for them to meet for the first time," he said. "It was better than I could have imagined."<br/>
<br/>
Meister said he expects more planned and unplanned events with the participants now that they are acquainted with each other.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://rethinkingcapitalism.ucsc.edu/</url><title>Bruce Initiative on Rethinking Capitalism </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b2e7c5c880727046006b5488b839e1fc"><name>strawberries-justice</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Strawberry &amp; Justice Festival Takes Place at CASFS Farm on May 5</title><summary>This year the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), UCSC’s Food Systems Working Group, and University Café are hosting a free, campus-oriented event on the theme of strawberries and social justice.

<p>For the second year in a row, the gala was held in Silicon Valley, where UCSC faculty and alumni continue to con- tribute to the innovative research, educational programs, and cutting-edge technologies that define the Valley. Attendees and sponsors raised over $160,000 for undergraduate scholarships at the dinner--one of UCSC&#8217;s premier fundraising events&#8212;which sold out several weeks in advance.</p>
