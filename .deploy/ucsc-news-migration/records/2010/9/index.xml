<br/>
Walking through the city of Choloma in the early morning hours, she watched as a broad coalition of protesters--including members of trade unions, women&#8217;s groups, campesinos, and human rights groups--blocked the main highways and bridges, creating barriers out of burning tires and branches.<br/>
<br/>
Frank is one of the top academic experts on Honduras in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
For the past year, she has been commenting on the volatile situation in that country for media ranging from <em>National Public Radio</em>, to the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, to the <em>Associated Press</em> (where she has been regularly interviewed by award-winning journalist--and UCSC alumna--Martha Mendoza from the AP&#8217;s Mexico City bureau).<br/>
<br/>
Frank has spent the past 10 years researching the area.<br/>
<br/>
And while Honduras may now seem to many people in the U.S. as just another vague political hot spot in a troubled world, the region is very real to Frank--particularly after she found herself wondering if she would be allowed to leave the country after filing several reports on opposition protests for <em>The Nation</em> magazine.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It was a real shock to go from working in a place that nobody paid attention to, and then abruptly seeing news about the country displayed frequently in the <em>New York Times</em>,&#8221; said Frank.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Suddenly my research and expertise on Honduras mattered on a national scale. And the misinformation and lack of knowledge about Honduras in the U.S. media was breathtaking.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It gave me a sense of responsibility as a scholar,&#8221; Frank added. &#8220;There are only three historians in the country that are working on modern Honduras.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Frank soon made herself available to the media and began talking to members of Congress, such as Sam Farr, about U.S. policy in the region. She also contributed a number of op-ed pieces about the ramifications of the coup to such media outlets as the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, <em>Huffington Post</em>, and <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/07/01/EDGV18GCQ4.DTL"><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
Frank is the author of <em>Bananeras: Women Transforming the Banana Unions of Latin America</em>, published in the U.S. in 2004, with a Spanish edition released in Honduras in 2005.</p>
<p>She received the "Book of the Year" award from the International Labor History Association for her previous book <em>Buy American: The Untold Story of Economic Nationalism</em>.</p>
<p>Frank was also honored with an Excellence in Teaching Award by the UC Santa Cruz academic senate&#8217;s committee on teaching in 2001.</p>
<p>Currently doing archival research and interviews for an upcoming book on the history of the U.S. labor movement&#8217;s intervention in the Honduran labor movement during the Cold War, Frank noted that she is often concerned about the safety of her sources in Honduras.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a tremendously dangerous situation for anyone critical of the ongoing coup regime,&#8221; said Frank. &#8220;Ten journalists have been killed since President Lobo&#8217;s inauguration in January. Human rights abuses--including death threats, assassinations and kidnappings--persist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s very impressive the way ordinary Hondurans continue to assert their basic democratic rights and civil liberties,&#8221; she added.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d39b139c8072704601456c99805e68ba"><name>fall-plant-sale</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Plant sale kicks off fall gardening season</title><summary>UCSC Farm &amp; Gardenâ€™s Fall Plant Sale will offer a rich and timely selection of organically raised vegetable seedlings, perennials, and California natives.

Planting veggies, annual flowers and perennials now will bring a bonus of fresh vegetables into fall and winter, and a bounty of blossoms next spring.</p>
<p>To keep gardening going into the fall, the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden&#8217;s Fall Plant Sale will offer a rich and timely selection of organically raised vegetable seedlings, perennials, and California natives. Sponsored by the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems, the sale takes place Friday and Saturday, September 10 and 11. The sale will be open from noon to 6 p.m. on Friday, and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday, in the Barn Theater parking lot at the intersection of Bay and High streets in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s vegetable offerings include spinach, kale, lettuce and salad mixes, Asian greens, chard, collards, fennel, and leeks, along with broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage and Napa cabbage. There will also be a good selection of fall- and winter-flowering annuals, including sweet peas, bachelor&#8217;s button, statice, calendula and stock.</p>
<p>The Farm &amp; Garden&#8217;s Fall Plant Sale is one of the largest all-organic events of its kind in the Monterey Bay Area. All flower and vegetable starts were propagated using organic methods. No chemical fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides were used in growing the plants from seed and cuttings.</p>
<p>In addition to winter vegetables annual flowers and culinary herbs, the sale will feature perennial flowers and shrubs. Featured will be a strong showing of more than a dozen rose varieties, from hardy climbers such "Will Scarlet" to classic favorites such as "Mme. Alfred Carriere," "Constance Spry." Also available will be "Charles Austin" and "Jane Austin" -- both heavy bloomers that flower over a long season.</p>
<p>Autumn is also a great time to plant California native species. Available this year will be a number of native species, including manzanita, clematis, toyon, coast silktassel, coast live oak, and several Ribes varieties. Other Mediterranean-climate favorites that offer great fall and winter color will be available, including <em>Salvia</em> <em>chamaedryoides</em>, a low-growing plant that features sapphire-blue flowers; <em>Ceratostigma griffithii</em>, a low-growing perennial with deep blue flowers that blooms summer into fall; and <em>Cestrum elegans</em>, an upright shrub with narrow, tubular burgundy flowers.</p>
<p>The sale will benefit the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden Apprenticeship, a six-month training course in organic farming and gardening. Members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden receive a 10 percent discount on purchases; memberships will be available at the sale.

<br/>
He taught writing at UCSC from 1970 to 1989, and created the Hitchcock Poetry Fund at Porter College in 2002. The endowment supports a variety of poetry-related programs on campus, including visiting poets, poetry journals, and conferences.<br/>
<br/>
Porter College provost David Evan Jones noted that &#8220;First through his own work as a poet, actor, director, publisher, teacher, and later through his generosity and vision as a donor, George Hitchcock empowered multiple generations of innovative poets.&#8221;&#160; <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Projects supported through his Porter College Hitchcock Poetry Fund have given Porter and UCSC more generally a national profile as a center for contemporary poetry representing a wide variety of aesthetics and approaches,&#8221; said Jones.<br/>
<br/>
Jones added that in 2007, Porter College honored Hitchcock and his long-time partner Marjorie Simon with a poetry reading marking the installation of a memorial bench for George at a quiet spot overlooking the Porter meadow. <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;When asked what inscription should appear on the bench, I thought of the <em>moire</em> patterns the wind makes in the tall grasses of the Porter meadow,&#8221; Jones recalled. "In George's <em>One Man Boat</em>,&#160; I found the following line in one of his poems:&#160; <br/>
<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "...I shall lean into the calligraphy of new wheat"<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I have heard George referred to as an &#8216;abundant&#8217; personality,&#8221; said Jones.&#160; &#8220;Indeed. We shall miss him very very much."<br/>

<p>The ability to control light pulses on an integrated chip-based platform is a major step toward the realization of all-optical quantum communication networks, with potentially vast improvements in ultra-low-power performance. Holger Schmidt, professor of electrical engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz, leads the team of researchers at UC Santa Cruz and Brigham Young University that developed the new device.</p>
<p>"Slow light and other quantum coherence effects have been known for quite awhile, but in order to use them in practical applications we have to be able to implement them on a platform that can be mass-produced and will work at room temperature or higher, and that's what our chips accomplish," Schmidt said.</p>
<p>Whereas optical fibers routinely transmit data at light speed, routing and data processing operations still require converting light signals to electronic signals. All-optical data processing will require compact, reliable devices that can slow, store, and process light pulses.</p>
<p>"The simplest example of how slow light can be used is to provide a data buffer or tunable signal delay in an optical network, but we are looking beyond that with our integrated photonic chip," Schmidt said.</p>
<p>The device relies on quantum interference effects in a rubidium vapor inside a hollow-core optical waveguide that is built into a silicon chip using standard manufacturing techniques. It builds on earlier work by Schmidt and his collaborators that enabled them to perform <a href="../../2007/06/1356.xml">atomic spectroscopy on a chip</a>. The first author of the new paper is Bin Wu, a graduate student in electrical engineering at UCSC. The coauthors include John Hulbert, Evan Lunt, Katie Hurd, and Aaron Hawkins of Brigham Young University.</p>
<p>Several different techniques have been used to slow light to a crawl and even bring it to a complete halt for a few hundredths of a millisecond. Previously, however, systems based on quantum interference required low temperatures or laboratory setups too elaborate for practical use. In 2008, researchers at NTT Laboratories in Japan developed a specially structured silicon chip that could slow light pulses by a factor of 170. Called a photonic crystal waveguide, it has advantages for certain applications, but it does not produce the quantum effects of the atomic spectroscopy chip developed by Schmidt's group.</p>
<p>Those quantum effects produce not only slow light but other interactions between light and matter that raise the possibility of radically new optical devices for quantum computing and quantum communication systems, according to Schmidt. In addition, the system makes it easy to turn the effect on and off and tune it to the desired speed of light.</p>
<p>"By changing the power of a control laser, we can change the speed of light--just by turning the power control knob," he said.</p>
<p>The control laser modifies the optical properties of the rubidium vapor in the hollow-core waveguide. Under the combined action of two laser fields (control and signal), electrons in the rubidium atoms are transferred into a coherent superposition of two quantum states. In the strange world of quantum physics, they exist in two different states at the same time. One result is an effect known as electromagnetically induced transparency, which is key to producing slow light.</p>
<p>"Normally, the rubidium vapor absorbs the light from the signal laser, so nothing gets through. Then you turn on the control laser and boom, the material becomes transparent and the signal pulse not only makes it through, but it also moves significantly more slowly," Schmidt said.</p>
<p>This study is the first demonstration of electromagnetically induced transparency and slow light on a fully self-contained atomic spectroscopy chip.</p>
<p>"This has implications for looking at nonlinear optical effects beyond slow light," Schmidt said. "We can potentially use this to create all-optical switches, single-photon detectors, quantum memory devices, and other exciting possibilities."</p>

<p>Bunch said the goal of the study is to better understand the language-related challenges facing students from language minority backgrounds in academic settings. Such knowledge can inform educators in their efforts to create the most effective means of preparing students, both in K-12 schools and in community colleges, for college-level academic work.</p>
<p>Bunch is one of 20 recipients of the 2010 National Academy of Education/Spencer Postdoctoral Fellowships that provide $55,000 for up to two years to pursue research in education.</p>
<p>"This is one of the most prestigious fellowships in the field of education," said Kip T&#233;llez, chair of the Education Department at UC Santa Cruz. "We're very proud of George."&#160; The fellowship will allow Bunch to build on his past research on how to improve educational conditions for English learners, T&#233;llez said.</p>
<p>Bunch said he plans to document the language demands of programs aimed at preparing students for professional degrees or certificates, such as those in nursing, X-ray technology, or early childhood education, as well as programs in the liberal arts, social sciences, and engineering that prepare students to transfer to four-year colleges and universities.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is widespread agreement that college-level work in English presents challenges for students from immigrant and language minority backgrounds,&#8221; Bunch said, &#8220;yet there is very little research that actually documents what those challenges are in specific academic contexts.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is concentrating his research on what educators and researchers call &#160;"Generation 1.5 students," college students who arrived in the United States during their K-12 school years. Their backgrounds and language characteristics fit neither the profile of newer immigrants and international students nor of monolingual English speakers, Bunch said.</p>
<p>He is focusing on community college students because groups identified as underrepresented at four-year universities and colleges typically begin their academic careers at community colleges.</p>
<p>"Two-thirds of all Latino postsecondary students seeking higher education begin in community colleges," Bunch said, "and almost half of all Asian/Pacific Islander college students attend community college. Among these students, immigrants choose community colleges over four-year colleges in greater proportions than do their native-born counterparts."</p>
<p>Bunch is currently completing a three-year project, funded by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, focusing on the testing and placement of U.S.-educated language minority students in California community colleges.</p>
<p>Bunch, who joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 2004, holds a bachelors degree from Georgetown University, and masters in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and a Ph.D. in education from Stanford.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

The award was <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/06/3853.html">announced</a> in June.</p>
<p>King Harald of Norway presented the Kavli Prizes in Astrophysics, Nanoscience, and Neuroscience to a total of eight laureates during a gala event at Oslo Concert Hall, with artist Asa Kleveland, former Minister of Culture for Norway, and actor Alan Alda hosting the ceremony.</p>
<p>The Kavli Prize awarded in each of the three scientific fields carries a cash award of $1 million, donated by Fred Kavli. Each of the laureates also receives a gold medal and a scroll.&#160;Nelson shared the astrophysics prize with Roger Angel of the University of Arizona and Ray Wilson of the European Southern Observatory.</p>
The laureates in the disciplines of astrophysics, nanoscience, and neuroscience were recognized for their groundbreaking discoveries and outstanding work in their fields. Each of these disciplines represents exciting and fast-growing areas of scientific research in which new discoveries and insights have the potential to make a strong impact on society, said Nils Christian Stenseth, president of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, in a speech at the ceremony. In addition to recognizing outstanding scientific research and honoring highly creative scientists, the Kavli Prize promotes public understanding of scientists and their work and fosters international cooperation among scientists, Stenseth said.<br/>
<br/>
The Kavli Prizes, awarded every second year, were given for the first time in 2008. Their founder is the Norwegian-American businessman and philanthropist Fred Kavli, who also spoke at the ceremony in Oslo.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f364c02c8072704601456c9932318ba1"><name>preview-days-2010</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Preview Days 2010</title><start-date>1283932800000</start-date><path>/2010/09/preview-days-2010</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/09/preview-days-2010</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1283983720308</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1287449020708</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Saturday, October 16 and Saturday, October 23</article-subhead><article-text><p>Preview Day is the annual campus open house to connect prospective students and their families with UCSC faculty, staff and students.

<p>Five doctoral degree candidates and one 2010 graduate will travel to China, the Kyrgyz Republic, Korea, Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela to conduct their research projects.</p>
<p>They are among more than 1,500 U.S. citizens who will travel abroad for the 2010- 2011 academic year through the <a href="http://www.iie.org/en/Fulbright/">Fulbright U.S. student program</a>.</p>
<p>UCSC had six successful applications from 11 submitted, a remarkably strong showing compared with the norm of other colleges and universities in past years. Final figures comparing applicants and winners from all U.S. institutions are expected in November.</p>
<p>"I am delighted that UC Santa Cruz continues to have such a high success rate among our Fulbright applicants," said Chancellor George Blumenthal. "It is another indication of the strengths of UCSC students and of our academic programs," he said.</p>
<p>Anthropology department chair Lisa Rofel, said the department "is enormously proud that so many of our students have been awarded Fulbright fellowships this year.&#160; I believe it speaks volumes about the quality of the students in our program and also about the intensive guidance our faculty give to our students."</p>
<p>Here's a look at the six Fulbright winners and their research proposals:</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Eunkyung Chee</strong></p>
<p>Anthropology Ph.D. candidate Sarah Chee was born in South Korea and emigrated to Southern California at age 3. She plans to return to her native country to continue her research into Protestant Christianity there, particularly its connection with defectors from North Korea.</p>
<p>Chee, 37, has already made seven trips to South Korea, including four conducting preliminary graduate research.&#160; She said that she has found a close connection between South Korea Protestants and North Korean defectors.&#160; Pastors in the south deliver sermons that place the north at the center of Korean Christianity by comparing North Koreans with the lost tribe of Israel, and calling the north the birthplace of Korean Christianity, Chee said. &#160;</p>
<p>"North Koreans are a gift sent by God for reunification," she recalls a South Korean Protestant working with North Koreans telling her.</p>
<p>Chee holds a B.A. in Asian American and East Asian Studies from UCLA and a M.A. from UCSC. Previously, her research has been supported by a Eugene Cota-Robles Fellowship and UCSC summer travel grant.</p>
<p><strong>Nellie Chu</strong></p>
<p>Nellie Chu is intrigued with Chinese manufacturing companies and how they break away &#160;from churning out products for foreign companies into creating their own designs, a phenomenon she calls "from 'Made in China' to 'Created in China.'" She plans to spend from September through December in the showrooms and factories of 10 designers in Shenzhen and Guangzhou.&#160;</p>
<p>"I've been interested in counterfeits for the longest time and want to look at the question of what is considered 'real,'" Chu said. "To what extent do they see themselves as artists."</p>
<p>Chu, 30, grew up in San Francisco where she took her Chinese heritage for granted. As a foreign exchange student in Germany she considered herself an American and was taken aback when a German native asked her where she was from. Her answer "America" didn't satisfy him. "No, <em>where</em> are you from," he insisted.</p>
<p>The exchange led Chu to contemplate what it means to be Chinese. Her research will probe the question with designers and factory workers who may begin with foreign designs only to improve them in a distinctly Chinese way. Chu is a Ph.D. candidate in anthropology. She holds a B.A. in International Relations and German from UC Davis. She's received support from a UCSC Regents grant, the UCSC anthropology department, and the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Crosson</strong></p>
<p>Spiritual Baptism is a Caribbean religion native to the islands from Trinidad to St. Vincent. Anthropology Ph.D. candidate Jonathan Crosson describes Spiritual Baptism as emphasizing imagined travel across national, ethnic, and religious boundaries through a ritual known as "mourning."</p>
<p>Crosson, 31, plans to spend a year in the islands researching how practitioners find their "true identity" through their spiritual travels that involve three days to weeks or more in blindfolded seclusion. The "mourner" may travel in the spirit to Africa, Egypt, India or China to find his or her spirit, Crosson says. He said he is interested in how these identities in the spirit may subvert or reinforce everyday understandings of ethnic identity, cultural heritage, and national politics in Trinidad.</p>
<p>Crosson, who grew up in Gainsville, Fla., graduated from Swarthmore College and taught in community college in Gainesville before enrolling at UC Santa Cruz where he obtained his masters in anthropology. &#160;He previously received a UCSC Regents grant and a UCSC executive vice chancellor fellowship.</p>
<p><strong>Naomi Glenn-Levin</strong></p>
<p>Naomi Glenn-Levin is in Tijuana and San Diego this summer and fall working with social services agencies that provide services for foster children. Thousands of people &#160;cross the border daily for school, work, and family obligations, Glenn-Levin says. Within that movement are families who come in contact with agencies on one side of the border, or both. &#160;</p>
<p>Her research will focus on the Tijuana branch of a family service agency and the San Diego County foster care system. She is especially interested in children who may be considered "abandoned" on one side of the border or the other due to immigration issues. She is also interested in the question of the "ideal family" and how that is interpreted in Mexico and the U.S.</p>
<p>Glenn-Levin, 27, grew up in San Diego, 30 minutes from the U.S.-Mexico border. She earned her B.A. in bilingual education and linguistics at Hampshire College. After graduation she taught at a project in Massachusetts to improve the quality of life for Spanish-speaking residents. She later taught Spanish at a small high school for students diagnosed with social and emotional learning disabilities. She obtained her masters in cultural anthropology from UCSC in 2009 and is working on her Ph.D.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis Keen</strong></p>
<p>Dennis Keen at 21 is the youngest Fulbright winner. He graduated from UCSC in 2010 with a B.A. in language studies and education.</p>
<p>Keen is an avid birdwatcher and Russian language speaker who first studied Russian in Kazakhstan the summer between his junior and senior years of high school. This month he will make his way to the Kyrgyz Republic, the former Soviet state in central Asia also known as Kyrgyzstan. There he will work to preserve the ancient art of hunting with golden eagles.</p>
<p>Keen, a fan of falconry, said he became fascinated with Kazakh nomads, known as berkutchi, who capture, train, and hunt with golden eagles in Western Mongolia. In the summer of 2009, he found a job teaching English there which enabled him to travel the country and interview eagle hunters. He learned that while Kazakh eagle hunters are thriving, those in the Kyrgyz Republic to the south aren't doing as well.</p>
<p>Only a few dozen are left, Keen said, mostly aging men. He wants to learn how they pass their ancient traditions from fathers to sons. More critically, he wants to help preserve the tradition. "If a well-coordinated preservation effort is not soon undertaken," Keen wrote in his proposal, "it is very likely that this tradition, which has survived for millennia, will not survive to see the next century"</p>
<p><strong>Carlo Moreno</strong></p>
<p>Carlo Moreno likes bugs. It began as a child fascinated with cockroaches in the Queens, N.Y. apartment where he lived and continued on summer trips to visit relatives in Colombia.</p>
<p>After a B.S. in biology from San Jose State and an M.S. entomology from the University of Maryland, Moreno, 31, an environmental studies Ph.D. candidate, is in the Venezuelan Andes for the next several months. There he will work with potato farmers to help restore traditional Andean long-fallow crop rotation techniques to restore soil fertility and promote pest resistance.</p>
<p>He'll be working above 12,000 feet elevation in the M&#233;rda region of Venezuela, an area that has undergone dramatic change since a surge in potato demand and the construction of a trans-Andean highway. Old ways have been supplanted by rapid modernization including imported seed varieties, lack of diversification, and application of pesticides.</p>
<p>His research focus is agroecology, the development of sustainable agroecosystems, a field in which he hopes to teach.</p>
<p>Moreno, who once worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture as an exotic pest inspector on incoming aircraft, said his interest in biological control began in Salinas Valley broccoli fields during an internship. He collected natural enemies of aphids, a common broccoli pest.</p>
<p>He has received a UCSC Regents grant, Eugene Cota-Robles Fellowship, environmental studies department grant, and COSMOS Club grant.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title>Dennis Keen</title><description>Dennis Keen, right, is one of six UCSC students who have been awarded Fulbright scholarships for a year's study and research abroad.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fc4e79ce8072704601456c99f0fe8527"><name>otter-toxin</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sea otter deaths linked to toxin from freshwater bacteria</title><summary>A potent toxin produced by bright-green blooms of freshwater bacteria has been flowing into the ocean and poisoning sea otters.</summary><keywords>Raphael Kudela, sea otters, toxin, microcystin, harmful algal blooms</keywords><start-date>1284138900000</start-date><display-name>Sea otter deaths linked to toxin...</display-name><path>/2010/09/otter-toxin</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/09/otter-toxin</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1284133255526</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenm</last-modified-by><last-modified>1284670375130</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/09/images/green-scum-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/09/images/green-scum-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>green-scum-300.jpg</name><display-name>green-scum-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>55297</file-size><width>300</width><height>399</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/09/images/sea-otter-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/09/images/sea-otter-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sea-otter-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>sea-otter-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22949</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The toxic cyanobacteria <em>Mycrocystis</em> gives this water sample from Pinto Lake its bright green color.

<p>In a paper published September 10 in <em>PLoS ONE,</em> the researchers reported that the deaths of at least 21 California sea otters (a federally listed threatened species) were linked to the toxin, called microcystin. First author Melissa Miller, a senior wildlife veterinarian at the DFG Marine Wildlife Veterinary Care and Research Center in Santa Cruz, will present the findings at the California and the World Ocean Conference in San Francisco on Friday, September 10.</p>
<p>The toxin is produced by a type of cyanobacteria (also known as "blue-green algae") called <em>Microcystis</em>. Warm, nutrient-rich water conditions favor large blooms of <em>Microcystis,</em> which can form thick green mats on the surface of the water.</p>
<p>"This study is significant because it is the first to establish a connection between freshwater contamination by microcystin and marine mammal mortality," said Miller, who is also affiliated with UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences. "This land-to-sea link has important implications for marine life and human health."</p>
<p>Coauthor Raphael Kudela, professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz, said the team found high concentrations of microcystin in lakes bordering Monterey Bay and in rivers that flow into the bay.</p>
<p>"The toxin itself is extremely stable. In laboratory studies, we found that microcystin didn't degrade much even after three weeks in ocean water," Kudela said.</p>
<p>Microcystin poisoning can cause acute liver failure or damage other tissues and can be fatal. In 2007, Miller began seeing dead and dying sea otters recovered along the shore of Monterey Bay with evidence of acute liver failure. After tissue from the otters tested positive for microcystin, Miller teamed up with Kudela and DFG chemists to search for environmental sources of the toxin. The investigation grew to include scientists from a wide range of state and federal agencies, including the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the California Department of Public Health, and the State Water Resources Control Board.</p>
<p>Pinto Lake in Watsonville has a history of <em>Microcystis</em> blooms and toxin production. Testing of the lake in the fall of 2007 confirmed the occurrence of an extensive bloom with high microcystin production. Pinto Lake drains into Corralitos Creek, which flows into the Pajaro River. "We were able to track the toxin all the way down the Pajaro River to within one kilometer of Monterey Bay," Miller said.</p>
<p>In 2009, Kudela began monitoring Pinto Lake and other locations around Monterey Bay using a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2009/05/2934.html">sampling tool</a> that his lab had developed to monitor ocean water for domoic acid, a toxin produced by marine algae. During the rainy season of 2009-10, the researchers detected microcystin contamination in the freshwater outflows of three rivers flowing into Monterey Bay: the Salinas, Pajaro, and San Lorenzo Rivers. The toxin was also detected in ocean water at the Santa Cruz wharf and at the mouth of the Pajaro River in October 2009 after "first flush," the first rain event of the year.</p>
<p>In laboratory studies, the researchers put oysters, mussels, clams, crabs, and other marine invertebrates that sea otters like to eat into large tanks of seawater and added microcystin-contaminated Pinto Lake water to the tanks. Subsequent testing showed that digestive tissues from the shellfish had up to 107 times higher concentrations of microcystin than was in the seawater. Tissues from shellfish exposed to the toxin continued to test strongly positive for microcystin for at least two weeks after the exposures ended.</p>
<p>Many of the microcystin-poisoned sea otters were recovered near river mouths and harbors, Miller said. While most of the cases (17) occurred within Monterey Bay, microcystin-poisoned sea otters were also found along the Big Sur and south-central California coastlines.</p>
<p>Four of the poisoned otters had been previously captured and tagged with radio-tracking devices as part of long-term research (a collaboration of USGS, UCSC, DFG, and Monterey Bay Aquarium), yielding detailed information about their ranges and feeding habits. The home ranges of all four overlapped in an area near Monterey Harbor, suggesting a common source of toxin exposure in that area, Miller said. In addition, three of these otters were known to feed heavily on marine clams and mussels.</p>
<p>Coauthor Tim Tinker is the lead scientist on sea otter studies for the USGS Western Ecological Research Center, which recently released the results of its <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/08/3958.html">annual census</a> of California's sea otter population, reporting a continued downward trend in numbers. Tinker, an adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, said the new findings provide one more clue in the effort to understand the observed increase in sea otter mortality.</p>
<p>"These findings also show the value in closely monitoring sentinel species like sea otters as a way to detect and understand threats to coastal oceans," he said.</p>
<p>The study suggests that humans may also be at risk from microcystin poisoning if they consume shellfish harvested near river mouths, especially during or after periods of freshwater runoff. According to Kudela, though, the toxin should not be a concern for commercially harvested shellfish, which come from areas unlikely to be contaminated by the toxin. He also noted that water treatment can remove the toxin from drinking water.</p>
<p>One reason for concern about human health hazards, however, is that there are no state or federal regulations for exposure to microcystin. Exposure to low levels of the toxin can damage the liver and other organs and may promote the development of liver cancer. The authors noted that no formal surveillance or regulatory system exists for microcystin detection in water or shellfish in most countries, including the United States.</p>
<p>The health hazards associated with recreational use of affected lakes and rivers are still unclear. Samples from Pinto Lake in 2007 yielded one of the highest concentrations of microcystin ever measured. Microcystin poisoning may also have caused the deaths of several dogs in the Monterey Bay area, Miller said.</p>
<p>"We suspect that dogs are getting poisoned when they drink contaminated runoff or get into the bacterial scum and then lick it off of their fur. However, we haven't been able to do perform postmortem examinations yet to confirm microcystin poisoning in local dogs," she said.</p>
<p>Initial project funding was provided by the State Water Resources Control Board, Division of Water Quality. The researchers have received funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to conduct further investigations at Pinto Lake and make recommendations for how the algal blooms might be controlled.</p>

<span></span> 
<p>When he steps down Sept. 16 as campus provost/executive vice chancellor (CP/EVC), Kliger will modify his schedule--but just a bit.</p>
<p>"The thought of riding my bike up when it&#8217;s not dark sounds really nice," said Kliger, who plans to return full-time to the lab he has maintained throughout his years as a campus administrator.</p>
<p>Kliger is wrapping up more than 20 years in UCSC's administration, including a five-year stint as CP/EVC and more than 15 years as dean of the Natural Sciences Division (now Physical and Biological Sciences).</p>
<p>When Kliger, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry, quips that he has always maintained a lab in part because he never wanted to worry about being ousted from an administrative job, there's an underlying seriousness to his remarks.</p>
<p>"As soon as you start to worry about your job, that's when you make bad decisions," he said. "I always wanted to be able to say, 'Fire me? Go ahead, make my day.'"</p>
<p>Kliger is a consummate multi-tasker who has always enjoyed doing many different things. In addition to teaching, research, and administration, he has played classical piano for more than 30 years. As CP/EVC, the challenge is handling whatever comes up each day.</p>
<p>"It's hard to explain how many problems come up every day. It&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s a normal day," he said. "Each day brings interesting challenges, because the easy problems are generally solved before they get to you. It can be nerve-wracking and frustrating."</p>
<p>It is also tremendously satisfying to work with great people and to make decisions that are in the long-term best interests of the campus. "That&#8217;s the part I&#8217;ll miss," he conceded.</p>
<p>What will life will be like without adrenaline-filled days? "I don't know," said Kliger, who is widely respected for his deliberative and calm manner, even in the midst of crisis. "Will I be bored?" he mused during a recent conversation in his Kerr Hall office.</p>
<p>Kliger was tapped by Chancellor Denice Denton to serve as CP/EVC after an extraordinarily successful tenure as dean: His was the second-longest term in campus history, behind only Ed Houghton of the Arts Division.</p>
<p>Kliger, who will return to campus as a research professor, said he is most proud of two accomplishments: his work in the division, where he helped attract the resources that enhanced the size and quality of almost every program, and the campus&#8217;s recently adopted Academic Plan. "Seeing how much we&#8217;ve advanced even in light of budget cuts" has been gratifying, he said.</p>
<p>Kliger is known for his commitment to teaching and research. Guiding the campus through three consecutive years of major budget cuts has been taxing, but Kliger said he learned a long time ago that "if you try to find solutions that will please everybody, you end up pleasing nobody."</p>
<p>He credits his wife, Rachel, with an insight that helped him make peace years ago with the fluctuating cycles of university budgets. "As dean, I was complaining all the time about the lack of resources, and she finally said to me, 'Either stop complaining and do the best with what you have or get out of the business,'" recalled Kliger. "That&#8217;s when I started to focus on what we could do instead of what we couldn&#8217;t do."</p>
<p>"I think being an academic is a great job. You get to do what you want," he said. "Faculty have incredible freedom. For all the complaints, I think faculty are among the most privileged people on earth."</p>
<p>Kliger and his two sisters were the first in their family to go to college. He remembers writing a paper for a high school assignment, in which he announced his intention to become a chemist, to study at Rutgers and then Cornell, and to become a professor.</p>
<p>"I'm still not sure if it was conscious or coincidence," he said, reflecting on his youthful ambitions and the uncanny accuracy of his predictions. "The only part I left out was my postdoc at Harvard--but I didn't even know about postdocs at that point."</p>
<p>Joining the UCSC faculty in 1971 was a pivotal decision. "I'd been frustrated by the structure of universities I knew, and when I interviewed here, everyone was clearly engaged in a new way of thinking about things," said Kliger, a man who prefers jeans to jackets and ties. A native of New Jersey, he took the job despite having vowed not to work in California because of the earthquake risk. "It was so beautiful that I said, 'Well, maybe it'll fall into the ocean, but in the meantime, it'll be a great place to be!'"</p>
<p>Although UCSC is "more traditional today than we were then," the faculty retain a strong commitment to working with undergraduates and to teaching students well, said Kliger. There is also a culture among faculty of friendliness and collaboration that suits him; for the most part, UCSC lacks the arrogance that characterizes many other schools.</p>
<p>"For me, research is a real team sport," said Kliger, whose own work focuses on how molecules interact with light. "Faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates work together. Everybody is contributing in different ways. Everybody should be stretched and learn something from the experience."</p>
<p>Which reminds Kliger that returning to the lab is only part of his retirement plan. "If the division needs me, I might like to volunteer to do some teaching," he said. "I've always enjoyed that."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fd863af28072704601456c998ea1191f"><name>galloway-evc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Meet Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway</title><summary>Look around campus this fall, and you'll likely see Alison Galloway.

(Photo by Jim MacKenzie)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Look around campus this fall, and you'll likely see Alison Galloway.</p>
<p>The new campus provost/executive vice chancellor (CP/EVC) plans to get out of Kerr Hall as much as possible during her first months on the job to hear the concerns of faculty, staff, and students.</p>
<p>"What I want to bring is an openness to the EVC role," said Galloway, who was selected by Chancellor George Blumenthal and approved by the UC Regents. "I'm not given to a lot of pomp. I really want to understand what's going on."</p>
<p>Galloway, a professor of anthropology, cherishes informality. Her office is decorated with Day of the Dead artwork, and she sips tea from a handmade mug embellished with a human skeleton. An animal lover, she volunteers with Native Animal Rescue, has two dogs (a mutt and a rescued American Brittany), two parakeets (that technically belong to her daughter, who moved away to college this fall), four owls undergoing rehabilitation, and two horses. She lives on six acres behind Dominican Hospital.</p>
<p>As CP/EVC, Galloway sees herself serving as a bridge between campus constituencies and as an advocate for UCSC at the systemwide level.</p>
<p>"A big part of my job will be to anticipate what's coming and be sure we are prepared," said Galloway. In an era of tight budgets, she plans to make fiscal decisions with an eye toward what will best serve faculty and students. Immediate top priorities include providing students with access to the classes they need and supporting faculty in that undertaking.</p>
<p>"Budget reductions have been very taxing on everybody," she said. "It's time to figure out if we're doing the best we can."</p>
<p>The opportunity to serve as CP/EVC comes at an optimal moment for Galloway, who is stepping down as vice provost of academic affairs and dean of UCSC Extension. She has also served previously as chair of the UCSC Academic Senate, campus diversity officer for faculty, and department chair of anthropology. "There's more I can give," she said.</p>
<p>Two other factors influenced her decision to apply for the number-two job on campus: The chance to work closely with Chancellor George Blumenthal, and her daughter's departure for college this fall. Blumenthal and Galloway served as chair and vice-chair, respectively, of the UCSC Academic Senate.</p>
<p>"Our greatest strength at UC Santa Cruz is our power to transform," she said. "We transform disciplines, we transform faculty. We nurture faculty to push the boundaries of what they can do, to push beyond the boundaries of their disciplines. And we do the same for students. We help them transform their lives."</p>
<p>In her new role, Galloway is eager to help boost the campus's reputation.</p>
<p>"The kinds of papers we put out are the ones that move disciplines," she said with pride, referring to a recent analysis that ranked UCSC fourth in the nation, behind only Harvard, CalTech, and MIT, for the number of times UCSC's scholarly publications were cited by other researchers. "That's how researchers acknowledge the pathbreaking contributions of their peers. It's a compelling measure of the greatness of a university."</p>
<p>Within her own profession, Galloway has pushed to revisit categories that identify race and sex, because classifications such as "male" and "female," as well as "white," "black," and "Hispanic," don't reflect the blurred lines of biological overlap nor the fluidity with which people identify themselves.</p>
<p>Like her CP/EVC predecessor Dave Kliger, Galloway intends to continue conducting research. Good thing, too, because law enforcement officials in the tri-county area rely on her when they need help identifying human remains. Many of the bodies she examines are homicide victims, and Galloway often appears in court as an expert witness to present her findings.</p>
<p>"Our role is to provide testimony based on what we found from the body," she explained. "We are the victim's only chance to provide information, which can result in a successful prosecution, or get somebody off who isn't guilty."</p>
<p>The quest for justice is a recurring theme in Galloway's life. Her commitment to diversity stems in part from personal experience as one of few women in forensic science, particularly early in her career.</p>
<p>"We'd go to professional meetings, and it was like we were invisible," she recalled. Today, there are very few people of color in her field. "We need to diversify, because the kinds of questions that need to be asked aren't getting asked," she said. "They won't get asked if we keep picking people from the same backgrounds."</p>
<p>Galloway, who was born in England but has lived in the United States since she was six, speaks with a slight English accent. She realizes English accents are perceived in this country as a "mark of privilege," but her own accent is rooted in her parents' working-class background in northeastern England, where residents labor in shipyards and coal mines.</p>
<p>"In England, you're marked by your accent, and my parents had to fight to modulate their speech," she said. "They didn't want to pass on their dialect."</p>
<p>Not willing to be bound by the past or confined by tradition, Galloway is determined to help UCSC define the terms by which it is known.</p>

The event is free with paid admission or membership.</p>
<p>The presentation by Sloan and Graves, "Climate Change and Wine: Observations, Impacts, and Implications," is part of the Science Sunday lecture series at the Seymour Center at Long Marine Laboratory. The two experts will talk about what drives climate change, what climate models can tell us about the future of California's climate, and what wine makers can do to ensure that their industry is able to adapt in an uncertain future.</p>
<p>Sloan directs the Climate Change and Impacts Laboratory at UCSC. She and her colleagues have developed a regional climate model that yields realistic scenarios for how climate conditions are likely to change throughout California's diverse geography over the next 50 to 100 years. Their findings on the local and statewide impacts of climate change have implications for a wide range of policy issues, such as the management of state water supplies, as well as for the state's wine industry.</p>
<p>Sloan has been using Graves's Saintsbury Winery in Napa Valley as one of her lab's data collection sites. This collaboration has moved Graves into the forefront of wine makers who are thinking about how climate change will affect their grapes, their product, and their industry. Wine grapes are highly sensitive to temperature, making the industry an early-warning system for problems that could affect all food crops.</p>
<p>"Wine is tied to place more than almost any other form of agriculture, in the sense that the names of the place are on the bottle," Graves said.</p>
<p>Located in Santa Cruz on the bluffs overlooking Monterey Bay, the Seymour Center provides exciting and engaging ocean education programs for the visiting public and for students of all ages. It is dedicated to educating youth, families, and the general public about the role science plays in the understanding and conservation of the world's oceans. The Seymour Center is open six days a week, year-round, and serves more than 60,000 people each year. The Seymour Center is celebrating its 10th anniversary on October 10.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="116473b18072704601456c9947376133"><name>BD-fellows</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>NSF program supports minority graduate students</title><summary>The National Science Foundation has awarded nearly $1 million to establish a Bridge to the Doctorate program at UCSC that will provide fellowships for science and engineering graduate students from underrepresented minority populations.</summary><keywords>NSF Bridge to the Doctorate, Bridge to Doctorate, CAMP</keywords><start-date>1284451200000</start-date><display-name>NSF program supports minority graduate students</display-name><path>/2010/09/BD-fellows</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/09/BD-fellows</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1284487017306</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1284487308880</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/09/images/BD-fellows-540.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/09/images/BD-fellows-540.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>BD-fellows-540.jpg</name><display-name>BD-fellows-540.jpg</display-name><file-size>88308</file-size><width>540</width><height>265</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/09/images/BD-fellows-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/09/images/BD-fellows-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>BD-fellows-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>BD-fellows-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25221</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><style type="text/css">/*<![CDATA[*/

<p>The new program--the first of its kind on the UCSC campus--will increase the number of underrepresented students successfully completing graduate degrees in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The $987,000 grant will support&#160; a cohort of 12 graduate students at UC Santa Cruz during their first two years in doctoral programs, beginning this fall.</p>
<p>The UCSC Bridge to the Doctorate Graduate Research Training Fellowship Program is an initiative of the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, the Baskin School of Engineering, and the Division of Graduate Studies, in partnership with the main office of the California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) at UC Irvine.</p>
<p>The graduate fellows starting the program this fall at UCSC include students in astronomy and astrophysics; ecology and evolutionary biology; chemistry and biochemistry; computer science; mathematics; microbiology and environmental toxicology; physics; and molecular, cell, and developmental biology. Students and faculty will engage in a focused program of intensive mentoring and professional development to prepare participants for a highly competitive doctoral environment and ultimately for careers in academia or in the technical workforce.</p>
<p>The UCSC program is the sixth Bridge to the Doctorate program in the UC system and is sponsored by the UC-NSF Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation. By increasing the success in graduate school of historically underrepresented members of society, the program will help to create a vibrant intellectual community at UCSC and a campus-wide research environment that welcomes diverse approaches to scientific discovery.</p>

(Photo by T. Stephens)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In Nader Pourmand's bioinstrumentation class, students are encouraged to come up with their own ideas for new biotechnology devices and applications. Sometimes, their "crazy ideas" turn into important research projects.</p>
<p>That was the case for Queralt Vallmaj&#243; Mart&#237;n, an exchange student from Spain who took Pourmand's course during her first quarter at UC Santa Cruz last fall. Pourmand, a professor of biomolecular engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UCSC, saw the potential in Vallmaj&#243;'s idea for a calcium detector and invited her to work on it in his lab. Now she is busy finishing up her work on the project before returning to Spain for her senior year at the Autonomous University of Barcelona.&#160;</p>
<p>"She's been working very hard," Pourmand said. "We still need to complete the final experiments, but I expect this project will lead to a publication in a high-impact journal. We combined her crazy idea and our tool to create a new device for the measurement of calcium."</p>
<p>Although she looks forward to seeing family and friends back in Spain, Vallmaj&#243; said she will miss Santa Cruz. "I really liked UCSC, and working in the lab has been a great opportunity," she said. "The upper division classes are small, so the professors really get to know you, and you can interact with them a lot. It's a good environment for students to come up with their own ideas."</p>
<p>When Vallmaj&#243; proposed a new type of sensor to measure calcium, she was thinking of medical applications because of the importance of calcium in pregnancy and diseases such as osteoporosis. Calcium also plays an important role in a wide range of biological processes within individual cells in the body. Pourmand realized that, although Vallmaj&#243;'s idea might not have clinical applications, a device that could measure calcium concentrations inside living cells would be a valuable tool for biomedical researchers. This could be achieved by basing the device on the "nanopipette sensor" technology that Pourmand's lab has developed.</p>
<p>"With the nanopipette, you can put the sensor into a cell and it will not kill the cell because the tip is so small," Vallmaj&#243; said.</p>
<p>Camilla Forsberg, an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering, said she sees great potential for this technology in stem cell research. Forsberg studies blood stem cells, which give rise to all the different types of blood cells in the body. One of her goals is to understand why a stem cell chooses one fate over another. "The ability to measure biological signals at the single-cell level would be great," she said.</p>
<p>Pourmand's nanopipette sensors use a technology called STING, for Signal Transduction by Ion NanoGating. Paolo Actis and Boaz Volozny, postdoctoral researchers in Pourmand's group, have been leading the development of the STING technology and worked closely with Vallmaj&#243; on her project.</p>
<p>To make the device, researchers start with a small tube of quartz glass. Using a laser, a special machine heats the midpoint of the tube and pulls it apart as the glass melts, yielding two tubes that taper to very fine points. The diameter of the pore at the tip of each nanopipette is about 50 nanometers (a thousand times smaller than the width of a human hair).</p>
<p>The next step is to make the device recognize a particular molecule or ion, which could be an antibody, a toxin, a DNA sequence, or an ion such as calcium. To detect calcium, Vallmaj&#243; coated the inside of the nanopipette with a protein called calmodulin that binds calcium. Several steps are involved in attaching a layer of calmodulin to the glass. Finally, an electrode is placed inside the nanopipette to measure the tiny current generated as ions flow through the pore.</p>
<p>While the STING sensor had been used successfully to detect large particles such as proteins and antibodies, it was unknown whether the device would respond to specific ions, which are hundreds of times smaller. Vallmajo's experiments showed a strong calcium response, likely due to the local change in surface charge as the calcium ions bind to calmodulin, Pourmand said.</p>
<p>"The nanopipette sensor is a versatile platform that can be customized for many different applications, anywhere from detecting biomolecules in single cells to monitoring contamination in the environment," he said. "A highly sensitive STING sensor can be precisely positioned, unlike other nanosensing technologies, at any subcellular region of a single living cell using a micromanipulator. The nanoscale ion sensor can also be used in remote devices for continuous water monitoring."</p>
<p>Vallmaj&#243; has not yet tested the calcium sensor in living cells, focusing first on perfecting the device and testing it in different solutions that mimic biological environments. Soon she will be back in Barcelona, taking the courses needed to complete her degree in biotechnology. But working in a lab has made her think seriously about continuing her research career in graduate school. She might even end up back in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"I don't have definite plans yet, but I have thought about coming back here for graduate school," she said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/news/article?ID=1846</url><title>STING in the world of biosensor technology</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1610930a8072704600f8b1246eb69cba"><name>move-in</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Fall 2010 move-in activities for students</title><start-date>1284537600000</start-date><display-name>Fall 2010 move-in activities for students</display-name><path>/2010/09/move-in</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/09/move-in</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1284565406326</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenm</last-modified-by><last-modified>1284566889653</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Welcome back!

The appointment is effective immediately.</p>
<p>Galloway, a professor of anthropology, succeeds David S. Kliger, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry, who is retiring as CP/EVC, a post he has held since March 2005.</p>
<p>As CP/EVC, Galloway is responsible for the day-to-day academic and administrative operations of the campus, including budget oversight, long-term planning, and advising Chancellor George Blumenthal.</p>
<p>"This is a great day for the campus," said Blumenthal. "Alison Galloway and I have worked together in several capacities over the years, and we make a good team. She has deep roots on campus and in the community, and she cares wholeheartedly about the university and its students, faculty, and staff. She is the right person at the right time."</p>
<p>"I want to thank Dave Kliger for nearly four decades of exceptional service to the campus, including the last five years as CP/EVC," added Blumenthal. "Dave has been a trusted colleague, and he has guided the campus through very difficult times. I congratulate him on his retirement from administration." Kliger plans to return to campus later this fall as a research professor of chemistry and biochemistry.</p>
<p>Galloway brings considerable scholarly achievement and administrative experience to the campus's number-two administrative post. At the time of her appointment as CP/EVC, Galloway was also serving as vice provost and dean of academic affairs and University Extension. She has resigned both posts, effective immediately; an announcement of her successors will be forthcoming.</p>
<p>"I want to bring an openness to the role of campus provost/executive vice chancellor," said Galloway. "I look forward to getting out of the office and talking with people. I want to hear the concerns of students, faculty, and staff."</p>
<p>Galloway is also one of the nation's leading forensic scientists. She is frequently asked by law enforcement officials to analyze and identify human remains. Because many of the cases she works on are homicides, she has referred to her work as "giving voice to victims." She is a frequent expert witness in court cases. She intends to continue her research while serving as CP/EVC.</p>
<p>Galloway joined the UCSC faculty in 1990. She has served as chair of the Anthropology Department, as well as chair and vice chair of the UCSC Academic Senate. She earned her Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Arizona and her B.A. in anthropology from UC Berkeley.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/galloway-evc.html</url><title>A feature article about the new campus provost</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://review.ucsc.edu/summer.99/facts_death.html</url><title>A Review magazine article about Galloway's work as a forensic anthropologist </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1784a7398072704600f8b124da8a2c2d"><name>coulter-jefferson</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC lecturer releases new CD showcasing music of Thomas Jefferson</title><summary>When most people think about the life of Thomas Jefferson, the subject of music rarely comes up.

<br/>
So it might come as a bit of a surprise to learn that our third president was an accomplished--and self-taught--classical violinist, who also had an unusual interest in traditional folk tunes.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Jefferson&#8217;s Fiddle</em>, a new CD release by UC Santa Cruz music lecturer and guitarist William Coulter on the Gourd Music label, is the result of a unique collaboration with his partner, UCSC Library reference specialist Laura McClanathan.<br/>
<br/>
The inspiration for the project came from McClanathan&#8217;s research with Thomas Jefferson scholar and interpreter Clay Jenkinson, who appeared in the 1997 Ken Burns documentary film, <em>Thomas Jefferson</em>.<br/>
<br/>
As McClanathan writes in the CD&#8217;s liner notes:</p>
<p>&#8220;When we found that Jefferson owned and loved some of the traditional Irish and Scottish tunes that we know so well today, the spark was ignited. So we called upon our longtime friend and musical collaborator Deby Benton Grosjean to provide the folk baroque fiddle artistry we needed. The end result is this recording that presents modern arrangements and readings of classical repertoire to showcase Jefferson&#8217;s extensive music library.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Coulter describes the CD as both Celtic and classical, with lively dance tunes, haunting airs, an Italian minuet, and lyrical harp and violin, adding that a lot of the tunes are song melodies.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;We picked tunes from his collection and mostly made our own arrangements of traditional ones,&#8221; said Coulter. &#8220;The CD also includes fairly straightforward versions of classical tunes, such as the piece by Corelli.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Deby&#8217;s style of playing embodies the core of the project, being a classically trained musician who was drawn to playing traditional music, especially Scottish,&#8221; added Coulter. &#8220;She had a similar musical world view to Jefferson--a classically trained musician who loved Americana as well.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Coulter began teaching at UC Santa Cruz in 1995, after earning a master&#8217;s degree from the campus in ethnomusicology with an emphasis on traditional Irish music, language, and song.</p>
<p>In 2004, he was awarded a Grammy for his contribution to The <em>Pink Guitar</em>, a collection of solo guitar arrangements of the music of Henry Mancini.</p>
<p>Coulter will celebrate the CD release of <em>Jefferson&#8217;s Fiddle</em> with a November 6 concert to be held at the Kuumbwa Jazz Center in downtown Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The event will feature Coulter on guitar, Deby Benton Grosjean (violin), Barry Phillips (cello), Shelley Phillips (harp, winds), Lars Johannesson (flute), and Neal Hellman (dulcimer).</p>
<p>The new CD, as well as tickets to the November 6 show, can be found at <a href="http://www.gourd.com">Gourd Music</a>: or by calling (831) 425-4939.<br/>

<p>Speakers include alumni Gunjan Sinha, executive chairman of MetricStream and a UCSC Foundation trustee, and Carl Steiner, chief design engineer at Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).</p>
<p>In a talk entitled "Entrepreneurship from the trenches: Role of innovation and entrepreneurship in science, technology, and society," Sinha will share his first-hand experiences using technology and entrepreneurship to drive business and social change.</p>
<p>Sinha earned his M.S. in computer engineering at UCSC in 1991. He was a co-founder of WhoWhere, which was sold to Lycos in 1998, and eGain, which went public in 1999. Over his career, he has served in various entrepreneurial, board, and executive positions developing and marketing software and Internet services.</p>
<p>Steiner's talk will be "A quick look at some advances in the integration of different technologies." He will discuss the creation of integrated autonomous systems and the need for a broad background, yet strong understanding of the fundamentals in a range of subject areas. Steiner earned his B.S. in computer engineering at UCSC in 1988.</p>

The appointment is effective immediately.</p>
<p>As I said in a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/galloway-announcement.html">statement to the media</a>, this is a great day for UC Santa Cruz. The CP/EVC is responsible for all day-to-day academic and administrative operations of the campus, including budget and long-term planning.</p>
<p>Alison Galloway is the right person at the right time. She is an accomplished scholar and an experienced leader. We worked together when I was chair of the UCSC Academic Senate and she was vice-chair. We made a good team then, and I'm confident we will make a good team again as we work together and advocate on behalf of this campus.</p>
<p>Galloway joined the faculty in 1990 and has held several administrative appointments, including most recently that of vice provost and dean of academic affairs and University Extension. She has resigned both of those posts, effective immediately; an announcement about her successors will be forthcoming. Read more about the new CP/EVC in this <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/galloway-evc.html">feature article</a>.</p>
<p>I also want to thank David Kliger, who is retiring after nearly four decades of excellent service to UCSC, including the last five years as CP/EVC. Dave has been a trusted colleague and a valued campus leader. He has guided this campus through extraordinary challenges, including three consecutive years of budget cuts. A professor of chemistry and biochemistry, Dave is eager to return to the lab, and I look forward to seeing him in the Physical and Biological Sciences Building.</p>
<p>This is a great way to start the academic year. I hope you will join me in congratulating Alison on her new appointment, and Dave on his important milestone.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="20aa3455807270460012e33d888fa466"><name>casfs</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC farm apprentices create their own jobs in the field</title><summary>A new study that looks at 20 years of the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture program at UC Santa Cruz finds that a large percentage of its alumni are still involved in growing and marketing organic food and teaching others how to do so. </summary><keywords>ucsc, uc santa cruz, farm, farm &amp;

<p>The paper "Achieving program goals? An evaluation of two decades of the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture at the University of California, Santa Cruz" is based on surveys of 299 graduates from 1989 through 2008. It is published in the premiere issue of the new online <em><a href="http://www.agdevjournal.com/inaugural-issue.html">Journal of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Community Development</a></em>, available for no charge until October.</p>
<p>Lead author Jan Perez, a research specialist with the <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu">Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems</a> (CASFS ) at UCSC, said the survey, one part of a larger internal evaluation, explored if the program's goals of having an impact on sustainable food systems were being achieved.</p>
<p>The findings are "both surprising and not so surprising," Perez said.</p>
<p>Not surprising, she said, because she expected a commitment to sustainable agriculture from the program's graduates. Surprising, because finding a job let alone eking out a living in the field is difficult. "You kind of have to go out and make your own job," Perez explained. The field doesn't have a lot of job openings awaiting graduates as graduates of a nursing program might find.</p>
<p>Forty-two percent of survey respondents reported creating jobs that did not previously exist, the survey found.</p>
<p>Perez and coauthors Damian Parr, a former apprentice who is now a postdoctoral fellow at the Agricultural Sustainability Institute at UC Davis, and Linnea Beckett, a graduate student researcher at CASFS, found the results showed an overwhelming number went into farming and gardening and a large number are still there. "More than 80 percent of the respondents have done some type of paid or vocation-related work since graduating. Sixty-five percent are still doing this work," the authors report.</p>
<p>The surveys were conducted in June and July 2009. Of the alumni the researchers contacted, 58 percent responded. In all, 37 percent of all alumni from 1989-2008 took part in the survey.</p>
<p>The pioneering Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture (AEH), part of the CASFS at UCSC, has evolved since 1967 when Alan Chadwick converted a rocky hillside below Merrill College into an organic food and flower garden that became the Student Garden Project. As of 2009, there were 164 colleges or universities offering education or training in sustainable food systems.</p>
<p>"AEH has been successful at both meeting its goals and addressing the mission of CASFS," report the authors, who also acknowledge their connections to AES and CASFS.&#160; Neither has a fiduciary interest in the program or the outcome of the study, they assert.&#160;</p>
<p>Their research was supported by the Foundation for Global Community and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://review.ucsc.edu/fall07/text.asp?pid=1599</url><title>UCSC celebrates 40 years at the forefront of sustainable agriculture</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2111d4c4807270460012e33df21d7fa9"><name>galloway-vpaa</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Two appointments to key leadership positions</title><summary>CP/EVC Alison Galloway announces appointments to two key leadership positions.</summary><start-date>1284710400000</start-date><display-name>Two appointments to key leadership positions</display-name><path>/2010/09/galloway-vpaa</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/09/galloway-vpaa</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1284750038103</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1284750277439</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am pleased to announce two appointments to key leadership positions.</p>
<p>First, Herbert Lee, professor of applied math and statistics, has been named interim vice provost for academic affairs (VPAA) and campus diversity officer for faculty (CDO-faculty). As VPAA, Lee is responsible for campus academic administration and planning, the review of academic programs and development of new programs, associated resource allocation, and academic personnel policy. As CDO-faculty, he will help promote diversity, equity, and inclusion on campus.</p>
<p>A member of the UCSC faculty since 2002, Lee earned his Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University and his B.S. from Yale University. His research interests include Bayesian statistics, computer simulation experiments, inverse problems, spatial statistics, and neural networks. I look forward to working closely with VPAA Lee as the academic year gets underway. His appointment takes effect Monday, September 20. A search for a permanent VPAA will be conducted this academic year.</p>
<p>Second, Lynda Rogers has been named dean of UC Santa Cruz Extension in Silicon Valley. This term appointment marks an important milestone as UCSC Extension emerges from a three-year restructuring and the campus prepares to launch a national search for a permanent dean.</p>
<p>Since 2007, Rogers has served as assistant vice provost for UCSC Extension and Academic Affairs. She was formerly the assistant vice provost of Silicon Valley Initiatives and executive director of the UC Online Academy. Rogers is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Organizational Leadership at the University of La Verne. She earned an M.A. in educational administration and an administrative services credential from San Jose State University in 2005, and a B.A. and teaching credential from UCSC in 1988 and 1989, respectively. Her appointment took effect yesterday (Sept. 16).</p>
<p>As one who is intimately familiar with the responsibilities of these positions, I am confident that VPAA Lee and Dean Rogers will provide top-quality leadership. Please join me in congratulating and thanking these highly capable individuals.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="213f6f30807270460012e33dfce581d2"><name>new-academic-year</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>45 years after opening, UCSC prepares for newest class</title><summary>Forty-five years after its inaugural opening in fall 1965, the University of California, Santa Cruz is making final preparations for the 2010-11 academic year.</summary><keywords>UC Santa Cruz, UCSC, new year, 2010-11 academic year, new year begins, move-in</keywords><start-date>1284710400000</start-date><display-name>2010-11 year about to begin</display-name><path>/2010/09/new-academic-year</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/09/new-academic-year</link><created-by>jrburns</created-by><created-on>1284753026744</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1284762452910</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns </name><title></title><phone>831-459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/09/images/2010 Street Banners finalrev-80.gif</path><link>site://news/2010/09/images/2010 Street Banners finalrev-80.gif</link><site>news</site><name>2010 Street Banners finalrev-80.gif</name><display-name>2010 Street Banners finalrev-80.gif</display-name><file-size>4401</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Nearly 45 percent of incoming freshmen are 'first in family' college students</article-subhead><article-text><p><img align="right" alt="Welcome poster for 2010-11 year" hspace="10" src="images/2010 Street Banners finalrev.gif" width="250"/>Forty-five years after its inaugural opening in fall 1965, the University of California, Santa Cruz is making final preparations for the 2010-11 academic year.</p>
<p>An estimated 4,525 new undergraduate students are expected when classes begin on Thursday, September 23. Most will move into university housing during the five-day&#160;fall-quarter "move-in" that takes place through Sunday, September 19. UCSC is also expecting approximately 400&#160;new graduate students on campus.</p>
<p>The following facts and figures describe this year's new students and the campus that is preparing for their arrival and a new academic year:</p>
<p><strong>Number of 'first in family' students jumps:</strong></p>
<p>Freshman classes continue to become more ethnically diverse at UCSC. And a significantly larger number of this year's freshmen are in position to become the "first in their families to earn a four-year degree," says Michelle Whittingham, UCSC's associate vice chancellor of enrollment management and director of admissions. These "first generation" freshmen are expected to make up nearly 44 percent of the class, compared to 37 percent just a year ago.</p>
<p>Nearly 29 percent of the freshman class&#160;is comprised of students from ethnic backgrounds that have been underrepresented within the UC system. The&#160;28.7 percent&#160;is a jump from last fall's&#160;24.9 percent. This fall's freshman class is also expected to comprise&#160;27.9&#160;percent students who are Asian American. Nearly 38 percent (37.5) of the students identified themselves as White/Caucasian,&#160;and 5.2 percent declined to report an ethnicity.</p>
<p><strong>2010-11 projected enrollment:</strong></p>
<p>Enrollment for the fall quarter will not be known until&#160;after the third week of classes. But the three-quarter average enrollment for the 2010-11 academic year is projected to be&#160;16,730&#160;&#8212; 400 more students than were enrolled on campus in the 2009-10 academic year.</p>
<p>Of the expected 4,525&#160;new undergraduate students,&#160;3,275&#160;will be&#160;new freshman and&#160;1,250&#160;new&#160;transfer students; the vast majority of transfer students are coming from California's community colleges.</p>
<p><strong>New academic programs:</strong></p>
<p>The following new degree programs will enroll their first students this fall:<br/>

<p>&#8226; Porter College dormitory expansion and renovation<strong>:<br/>
</strong>Work on Porter College House A, a 4-story residential dormitory, has added 177 bed spaces to the campus housing inventory. Two new floors are providing 159 new bed spaces, and renovations and adjustments on lower floors provided another 18 new bed spaces. The project also included seismic upgrades. This project is on track to achieve LEED certification, along with Porter College House B and the Dining Commons. The dormitory is home to a new housing community for approximately 500 incoming transfer students.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8226; Cowell Student Health Center expansion and renovation:<br/>
The Health Center project added a 7,600-square-foot wing to the Health Center and renovated the existing facility for Student Health Services and Counseling and Psychological Services.&#160; The project also addressed seismic and accessibility needs.&#160; The recently completed project is designed to achieve an equivalent of a LEED certified rating and/or outperform the provisions of the California Energy Code's energy-efficiency standards.</p>

<p><strong>UCSC in the news:</strong></p>
<p>The new academic year will begin with UCSC people having received numerous accolades in recent months:</p>
<p>&#8226; With Chancellor George Blumenthal in attendance, UCSC astronomer Jerry Nelson&#160;<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/kavli-ceremony.html"><span>received the Kavli Prize</span></a>&#160;in Astrophysics at a ceremony September 7 in Oslo, Norway.</p>

<p class="Body">Ogawa is the 2010 winner of the <a href="http://www.ucea.org/the-roald-f-campbell-award/">Roald F. Campbell award</a> for lifetime achievement by the <a href="http://www.ucea.org/">University Council for Educational Administration</a>.</p>
<p class="FreeForm">It is "probably the most prestigious award we give in our field,&#8221; said Alan Shoho, UCEA president. &#8220;Past winners are all considered giants in the field."</p>
<p class="Body">Ogawa will receive the award next month when the UCEA holds its convention in New Orleans.</p>
<p class="Body">Ogawa is a former secondary teacher who taught at UC Riverside before joining UC Santa Cruz in 2002. He is a previous chair of UCSC's education department.</p>
<p class="Body">"I have to admit that it's rewarding to be recognized by my peers," he said.</p>
<p class="Body">The University Council for Educational Administration is a consortium of higher education institutions committed to advancing the preparation and practice of educational leaders for the benefit of schools and children.</p>
<p>Ogawa was selected based on three criteria: longtime distinguished service as a teacher and researcher in the field of educational administration; superior contributions to the field's body of knowledge; and recognized leadership efforts to improve the field, especially the preparation of educational administrators and/or professors of educational administration.</p>
<p>Shoho said he considers Ogawa one of his mentors, in no small part because both are Japanese American in a field with few Asians. "He is a great role model for everyone," Shoho said. "He practices what he preaches."</p>
<p>Ogawa said he had been "fortunate to have worked with many wonderful people, including mentors, colleagues, students, and staff members, who generously shared their knowledge, time, and effort. I owe all of them my deepest gratitude," Ogawa said.</p>

<p>According to popular wisdom, syndrome sufferers become unhinged when their kids move out. They can't stand the fact that their sons or daughters have sprung the nest to go off to college or get married.</p>
<p>The silence in the house is too intense. They miss their kids desperately--and are confronted with the evidence of their own aging. Despondency sinks in. But an enthusiastic group of Slug parents, whose children headed off to UC Santa Cruz this fall, don't fit that psychological profile.</p>
<p>The truth is more complex. They feel a little unsettled about their children heading out to a four-year university. But they're also feeling excited and optimistic--not to mention gleeful about their children having to do their own laundry.</p>
<p>Paula and Bruce Tomlinson, whose son, Douglas, entered UC Santa Cruz as a freshman this fall, aren't exactly bemoaning their son's departure.</p>
<p>"We started a group here in Los Altos called the Non Grieving Empty Nesters," Paula Tomlinson said with a laugh.</p>
<p>She says that she will certainly miss the energy that Douglas, who plans to study filmmaking, has brought to the family household. "I'm feeling a bunch of conflicting emotions," she said. Then again, she added, "he is going to have to clean up after himself."</p>
<p>Tomlinson concedes that she'd feel much more unsettled if Douglas was heading off to a university far away, such as on the East Coast.</p>
<p>"You know, I'm lucky in the sense that my kid will only be 35 minutes away," Tomlinson said. "It's not like I'm an Empty Nester with a kid on the other side of the continent. I can always phone him up and say, 'Hey, how about lunch?' I can always check in on him to make sure he's alive and well and not fully tattooed."</p>
<p>It also helps that the whole family has already experienced geographical upheavals that are far more dramatic.</p>
<p>Before returning to the United States, the family had moved around to various countries because of Bruce Tomlinson's work; he was a partner at Deloitte &amp; Touche--a giant professional services organization with staff in 140 countries--before changing jobs and becoming the CFO of a commodities company based in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
<p>Now the question is: What will the parents do next, now that the focus of their energies over the past 18 years will be living and studying in Santa Cruz?</p>
<p>"We are going to pick up where we left off," Paula Tomlinson said. "Now we will devote the rest of our lives to being a couple again."</p>
<p>Other new Slug parents echoed the Tomlinsons' words.</p>
<p>Asked if she was suffering the Empty Nest blues because her daughter, Alexandra, is just about to start classes at UCSC, Mariza Cortez-Cota of Sonora replied: "Are you kidding me?"</p>
<p>For one thing, she has another child in the house--a son in high school. Besides, her predominant feeling is excitement, not separation worries.</p>
<p>"Sure, I'm going through some separation anxiety, but most of all I'm thrilled, because she happens to be the first in her generation to go directly to a four-year university," Cortez-Cota said.</p>
<p>These upbeat reactions are consistent with a widely publicized longitudinal study spearheaded by Sara Gorchoff, a visiting professor at Carleton College who led the study when she was a Ph.D. candidate in psychology at UC Berkeley. Gorchoff also happens to be a UC Santa Cruz alumna herself.</p>
<p>The subjects of the study were first tracked in the late 1950s by Ravenna Helson, who focused on 123 Bay Area women and followed them through marriage, child rearing, and other landmarks.</p>
<p>The long-term study found that overall marital satisfaction increased after their children sprang the nest for various reasons, including going off to college, contrary to popular wisdom.</p>
<p>"There was a big historical trend in research to talk about the empty nest--that you would be bereft, devastated when the kids leave home," Gorchoff said. "There is not a lot of empirical recent evidence supporting that. Even before I did the research I found that the idea of children leaving home being traumatic for mothers isn't well supported, and it has become less and less the case over time."</p>
<p>The empty nest blues were short-lived for Cortez-Cota.</p>
<p>"At first I was melancholy," she said. &#160;"I would say to people--but not in front of my daughter--'I'm sad that she's going to leave because my daughter is my right hand.'</p>
<p>But then I went to orientation and saw where she is going to live, and the wonderful friends she has there."</p>
<p>Cortez-Cota was also impressed by her daughter's planned course of study, involving digital media and filmmaking. "Now the joke in my family is, 'I'm not sad because you're leaving. I'm sad because I can't go with you.'"</p>
<p>Cortez-Cota, who works in marketing, sales, and development for a solar-energy company, pursued her education all the way up to her first year at community college, after emigrating with her family from Mexico to the United States.</p>
<p>"And now, here's my daughter, going straight to the university," Cortez-Cota said. "If you go back every generation that has been quite a step up for us. I am overwhelmed with pride."</p>
<p>Terry Taylor of South Pasadena, whose son Lance is heading out to UCSC this week, is facing an empty nest, but she is thrilled to see her son "entering the world of adulthood, and leaving the non-adult years behind."</p>
<p>Taylor concedes that her house is going to be "more quiet than normal because he is not going to be home as often on the weekends. But it's not going to be so shocking because he's already been to boarding school."</p>
<p>Besides, Taylor has no problem with sending her son into the world of adulthood.</p>
<p>"I told him, 'Your parents are no longer responsible for you,'" Taylor said.</p>
<p>When a young person heads off to college, "they have to learn to prioritize," Taylor said. "They can vote. They are legally capable of signing contracts. They can have their first doctor's visits without their parents' knowing."</p>
<p>But Taylor is trying to strike a balance with Lance. While she encourages him to strike out on his own, she wants him to feel comfortable asking her for advice.</p>
<p>"The word 'freedom' has so much meaning," she said. "It can be a joyous thing for them. But at the same time, independence can be frightening. It's a lot for them to deal with at one time. So much is thrown at you almost immediately."</p>

<style type="text/css">.callout-right{width:175px;background-color:#f2f0e4;}</style>
<div class="callout-right">Elliot Aronson will talk about his book at 7:30 p.m. Thursday, September 30 at the Capitola Book Caf&#233;.</div>
<p>Elliot Aronson is telling a story.&#160; One of the preeminent social psychologists of our times, Aronson loves telling stories. He's good at it and has an abundant collection to choose from.</p>
<p>His favorite in a candid and engaging new memoir <em>Not by Chance Alone, My Life as a Social Psychologist</em> (Basic Books) concerns Leon Festinger, a prickly professor at Stanford University in the 1950s when Aronson was a graduate student.</p>
<p>Aronson is walking down the hall when Festinger barks out his name. Pulling a paper from a pile of hundreds on his desk, Festinger holds it between his thumb and forefinger as if it were a piece of trash. "I believe this is yours," he says with a mix of pity and contempt, Aronson remembers.</p>
<p>Aronson dreaded the red marks he expected to find. Instead there was nothing.&#160; He steeled himself to inquire why. With that same mix of pity and contempt, Festinger told him that if he didn&#8217;t care enough about his work to give it his best effort the result was not worth his comment.</p>
<p>Getting that paper was a critical moment in Aronson's life. He had a choice.&#160; He could drop the class and accept defeat.</p>
<p>Instead, he spent the next 72 hours reworking the paper and handed it to his mentor. Fifteen minutes later Festinger walked into his office, sat on the edge of his desk, put his hand on his student&#8217;s shoulder and said: &#8220;Now this is worth criticizing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At that moment we became colleagues,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It was an incredible gift.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Impoverished upbringing<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>His impoverished upbringing in Revere, Mass. during the depression shaped his story. His background helped determine who he was and who he became.</p>
<p>As a boy, Aronson was painfully shy, a mediocre student at best, with uneducated parents, including an angry and often unemployed father. There were no books in the house but plenty of anti-Semitic toughs in his neighborhood who often jumped him. The sting of anti-Semitism would guide his later work in combating prejudice.</p>
<p>So how did he become the man whom his colleagues listed among the 100 most influential social psychologists of the 20<sup>th</sup> century -- and the only person in the 120-year history of the American Psychological Association to win all three of its major awards for distinguished research, distinguished teaching, and distinguished writing?</p>
<p>As he'll tell you, he got some good breaks and made the most of them, thus the title. &#160;Along the way, he encountered some inspired mentors.</p>
<p><strong>Older brother Jason</strong></p>
<p>Let's begin with the first, his brother Jason, 2&#189; years older.</p>
<p>"My brother was an incredible influence in every respect," Aronson said during an interview at his Santa Cruz home. "For one thing, he was the first person who thought I was really smart.</p>
<p>"He was very clear on what he wanted to do and what he wanted me to do," Aronson said. Jason was determined both brothers would attend college. When their father died, the extended family decided Elliot should drop out of high school and work. Jason, however, persuaded him he was smart enough to apply to college, and that he could work his way through.</p>
<p>It's a good thing the admission officer at the newly opened Brandeis University didn't see his grades before they saw his SAT scores, Aronson says. The university didn&#8217;t just admit him. They gave him a scholarship, too.&#160; However, it wasn't renewed after the first year. Aronson slept in the woods or unlocked parked cars and occasionally boosted food and books to get by.</p>
<p>At Brandeis, he reluctantly chose economics -- a "practical" major. But after accompanying an attractive young woman into an introductory psychology class he was inspired by a new professor, Abraham Maslow, founder of humanistic psychology. Maslow became a second key mentor in Aronson&#8217;s life. Maslow's work on the hierarchy of needs influenced Aronson's "soft" side.</p>
<p>If Maslow was the yin, the yang was Festinger at Stanford where Aronson obtained his Ph.D. It was Festinger who introduced him to cognitive dissonance, which Aronson regards as an exciting and provocative theory that still figures prominently in his research and writing. Festinger, whom Aronson calls the &#8220;single most influential social psychologist who ever lived,&#8221; taught him &#8211; forced him, really &#8211; to set the bar high and not settle for anything the least bit sloppy.</p>
<p><strong>"Heart of Maslow, tough-mindedness of Festinger"</strong></p>
<p>Aronson "combined the heart of Abraham Maslow with the tough-mindedness of Leon Festinger,&#8221; a colleague observes in another new book, <em>The Scientist and the Humanist: A Festschrift in Honor of Elliot Aronson,</em> (Psychology Press 2010).</p>
<p>Maslow hired Aronson and another student &#8211; his "absolute favorite" &#8211; Aronson remembers, as assistants. The other student was Vera Rabinek, a Holocaust survivor from Hungary, who was "brilliant, gorgeous, and fairly glowed with a quality that I would call serenity," he writes. They've been married for 56 years and have raised four children&#160; -- all of whom graduated from UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</p>
<p>"I see it as one lucky break after another,'' he said.</p>
<p>From Brandeis the couple went to Wesleyan for a master's degree and then Stanford, lured by a Wesleyan colleague Richard Alpert, later and better known at Baba Ram Dass. Alpert &#8220;taunted&#8221; Aronson into taking Festinger&#8217;s graduate seminar.</p>
<p>Aronson weaves his stories of the people he has met with the major trends in social psychology over the past 60 years including encounter groups and sensitivity training in the '60s, movements in which he played a major part. He describes his work developing the "jigsaw classroom," his experiment in cooperative learning to counter the stresses of school desegregation, and experiments to encourage condom use among sexually active college students.</p>
<p>Aronson taught at Harvard and the University of Texas, Austin before arriving at UC Santa Cruz in 1974, attracted by the location and the unique experimental (at the time) focus on undergraduate education.</p>
<p><strong>Macular degeneration</strong></p>
<p>Since 2000, Aronson has suffered progressively worsening macular degeneration that has rendered him legally blind. He can see shapes but not faces, especially painful for a grandfather with four young granddaughters.</p>
<p>Aronson said he&#8217;s been &#8220;reading&#8221; more than ever these days but now it&#8217;s audio books. His blindness led to the memoir. He cannot do book research anymore, cannot &#8220;skim five pages in 30 seconds,&#8221; but writing an autobiography doesn&#8217;t require library research, he said.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Aronson was invited to write a chapter on his life for an American Psychological Association history of psychology. His agent for his previous book - <em>Mistakes were Made (but not by me)</em> (Harcourt, 2007) - wanted to read anything he wrote and read the chapter. The agent insisted it should be a book.</p>
<p>Aronson said he figured it would sell 11 copies, &#8220;nine to people named Aronson.&#8221;&#160; But, he thought, if nothing else the stories would be a nice present for his grandchildren.&#160;</p>
<p>Turns out, &#8220;It&#8217;s the most fun I&#8217;ve had writing anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal recently received the top UC honor for service to the Academic Senate at both the systemwide and campus levels.</p>
<p>Blumenthal received the 2010 Oliver Johnson Award for Distinguished Leadership in the Academic Senate during the annual systemwide Academic Council dinner on July 28.</p>
<p>The award is presented every other year to a member of the UC faculty who has performed outstanding service to the Academic Senate, exhibited exceptional abilities in working with different university constituents, and made a significant impact on faculty governance.</p>
<p>"I believe that the system of shared governance contributes significantly to UC's excellence," said Blumenthal. "My senate service, both at UCSC and at the systemwide level, has been enormously gratifying. I am deeply honored to receive the Oliver Johnson Award."</p>
<p>In a letter informing Blumenthal that he'd been selected for the honor, Academic Council Chair Henry Powell wrote, "Your record of distinguished service and leadership clearly meets the high standards of the Oliver Johnson Award. Indeed, your exceptional service is demonstrated by the fact that in every instance of your service, you have risen to a new position of leadership."</p>
<p>Blumenthal joined the UCSC faculty in 1972 as a professor of astronomy and astrophysics. He has served as chancellor since 2006, capping decades of service to the Academic Senate in leadership roles. He served as chair of the UCSC Committee on Privilege and Tenure, chair of the systemwide Committee on Privilege and Tenure, chair of the UCSC Academic Senate from 2001 to 2003, and finally as vice chair and then chair in 2004-05 of the systemwide Academic Council and the Assembly of the Academic Senate. He served as faculty representative to the UC Regents in 2003-05.</p>
<p>Blumenthal's lasting impacts on the systemwide Academic Senate include leading the effort to amend Senate bylaws regarding membership, leadership, and charges to standing committees of the Assembly. That work was accompanied by 2003 revisions to the Faculty Code of Conduct. He also helped establish a new Senate Division at UC Merced.</p>
<p>"You have been instrumental in advocating for greater Senate involvement not only at UCSC, but also at the systemwide level," wrote Powell, who called Blumenthal "a champion and exemplar of shared governance as Chancellor."</p>
<p>A passionate advocate of academic freedom, Blumenthal guided the Senate's Resolution on Research Funding Sources through the Academic Assembly. That effort affirmed the Senate's belief that banning certain sources of funds by a majority vote of the faculty would infringe on the academic freedom of individual researchers who may want to accept the funding.</p>
<p>Blumenthal also spearheaded Senate regulation amendments to facilitate the transfer of students among the three branches of public higher education in California.</p>
<p>Finally, he instituted the practice of inviting Regents to Council meetings and inaugurated the "Annual Report on Shared Governance." Blumenthal is the fourth former systemwide Academic Senate chair to serve as a UC chancellor.</p>
<p>The Oliver Johnson Award, which includes a small honorarium, was established by a gift to the systemwide Senate from UC Riverside Professor Oliver Johnson, a professor of philosophy and longtime Senate activist who died in 2000. Nominations are solicited by the University Committee on Committees from each divisional Committee on Committees, which may submit one name at the beginning of every other academic year. The recipient is chosen by a majority of the full Academic Council and ratified by the Assembly of the Academic Senate in May.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="35264c7f807270460012e33d20b59c7d"><name>move-in1</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New students, families greeted with disco, car washes, open arms</title><summary>In some parts of America, college move-in week is a generic affair.

(Photos by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>UC Santa Cruz is no place for a generic, run-of-the-mill move-in weekend</article-subhead><article-text>For just a nanosecond, the mother behind the wheel of the Honda Pilot 4WD looked startled and beside herself as she pulled up to College Ten. 
<p>She had just driven up to help her child, an incoming first-year, unload some belongings. Suddenly a large group of smiling, disco-dancing, identically dressed College Ten students appeared from nowhere. Why were they clapping, shimmying, and boogie-ing around her vehicle?</p>
<p>"Welcome to college, bay-beeeeeee!" one student helper called out in an Austin Powers accent. The bass line from a Kool and the Gang song made the whole quad vibrate. Someone offered to wash the mom's car free of charge.</p>
<p>When the mom figured out that this was the College Ten move-in welcome wagon, she started laughing and clapping. After unloading the woman's car, the student group waited for the next arrival. When another car pulled up, someone shouted "Incoming!" and the process began all over again.</p>
<p>"We want them to feel comfortable around here, to feel welcome," explained one of the greeters, Angela Luo, 18, a health sciences/community studies major. "They are part of a family now."</p>
<p>In some parts of America, college move-in week is a generic affair. You drive up with your children and a bunch of bedding and electronic equipment stuffed in your car. You say good-bye and drive away. But this is UC Santa Cruz, where there is no place for generic behavior or doing anything in a boring, run-of-the-mill way.</p>
<p>The emphasis was on informality and just-folks friendliness. That explains why new Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway was spotted at College Nine unloading a small box with a comforter squished inside it while Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" rumbled in the background.</p>
<p>Move-in is a major event at UCSC, where an estimated 4,525 new undergraduate students are expected when classes kick off for the year on September 23. Most of them drove up and moved in during one busy five-day period that ended on September 19, with the help of coordinators and student volunteers.</p>
<p>The coordinators managed to make move-in relatively free of complications by using a permit system in which parents were given designated time periods to unload belongings. That is no mean feat, considering that a large number of those student volunteers were directing traffic, giving pedestrians directions, and dancing simultaneously.</p>
<p>By 11 a.m. on Friday, students had washed 163 cars that had arrived to unload at College Ten. In many cases, those cars badly needed that wash. Some families traveled a long way to get there. In the East Remote parking lot, cars had plates that said Utah, Wisconsin, Washington, Nebraska, and Nevada. One red Ford Explorer was so stuffed to the gills that someone had lashed an igloo-shaped, bamboo-framed lounge chair to the roof with a bungee cord.</p>
<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal blended in with his Slug ballcap when he went up to greet people and unload students' belongings in the College Nine and Ten complex.</p>
<p>On his way up to campus, a student volunteer, who did not recognize him, stopped the vehicle and asked Blumenthal, "Do you work here?"</p>
<p>Blumenthal replied, "Yes," and was waved ahead.</p>
<p>Returning student volunteers worked hard to keep the atmosphere festive and friendly. Still, it was a moment of truth for many families--especially those with children who were the first to leave town for a four-year university.</p>
<p>Walter Bonilla, 19, was on campus to say goodbye to his little brother, Edwin, an incoming Stevenson first-year. The family drove up from Bakersfield in a van. Edwin and his siblings are first-generation Americans; their parents are from El Salvador.</p>
<p>"We want to let him know he's got a lot of support," Walter Bonilla said. "It's a big step for him. And I do feel protective of him."</p>
<p>"It's the biggest thing I've done," said Edwin Bonilla, who is considering a health sciences/biological sciences major. "I want to be an inspiration for my (9-year-old) sister. I want her to know that she can leave and be successful and not have to stay home. I feel like I'm paving the way."</p>
<p>Elaine Saffan of La Verne, near Pasadena, was waiting in the same line. She was there to help out her daughter, Gina Saffan, an 18-year-old Stevenson first-year.</p>
<p>"She's my one and only," Elaine Saffan said, "but I know she's going to do great."&#160; She planned to help Gina unload their packed SUV. It was a busy day. They would have to move quickly.</p>
<p>"At 3 p.m. there will be an ice cream social," said Elaine Saffan. "And then, the parents are told to leave. At that point, it's goodbye."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page type="page"><content></content><path>/2010/09/new-academic-year</path><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><link>site://news/2010/09/new-academic-year</link><site>news</site><name>new-academic-year</name><display-name>2010-11 year about to begin</display-name><title>45 years after opening, UCSC prepares for newest class</title><summary>Forty-five years after its inaugural opening in fall 1965, the University of California, Santa Cruz is making final preparations for the 2010-11 academic year.</summary><keywords>UC Santa Cruz, UCSC, new year, 2010-11 academic year, new year begins, move-in</keywords><start-date>Sep 17, 2010 1:00 AM</start-date></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title>45 years after opening, UCSC prepares for newest class</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="356841e4807270460012e33d3924fffa"><name>shilling-announcement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC names new Associate Vice Chancellor for Strategic Philanthropy</title><summary>Jeffrey J.

Shilling, former chief development officer for Stanford University&#8217;s Department of Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation, has been named associate vice chancellor for strategic philanthropy at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Shilling will coordinate fundraising efforts campuswide and guide UCSC toward its first-ever comprehensive campaign, as the campus celebrates 45 years of innovative academic, research and service excellence.</p>
<p>At Stanford, Shilling was responsible for all aspects of fundraising for the nation&#8217;s top-ranked Division I intercollegiate athletic program.</p>
<p>He previously served as associate director for both development and the business school fund at Stanford&#8217;s Graduate School of Business, where he directed major components of the annual, reunion, and major gift programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeff Shilling is an experienced and successful development professional who understands the importance of philanthropy in building outstanding programs,&#8221; said UCSC Vice Chancellor of University Relations Donna Murphy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found Jeff to be a person of high integrity with the right combination of experience, initiative, and advancement knowledge to drive our future fundraising success,&#8221; Murphy added. &#8220;He&#8217;s a great addition to the campus and the Santa Cruz community.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Shilling&#8217;s extensive experience includes the position of vice president for advancement at Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose, where he managed the development, communications, alumni, and parent relations activities for the 1500-student college preparatory high school.</p>
<p>He also served as director of annual giving for Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thrilled to be joining UCSC at an important time in the university&#8217;s history,&#8221; Shilling noted. &#8220;I look forward to working with Chancellor Blumenthal, the deans and faculty, and my University Relations colleagues to increase philanthropic support for the campus community and launch the university&#8217;s first comprehensive campaign.&#8221;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Shilling&#8217;s academic credentials include a master&#8217;s degree in business administration and a bachelor of science degree in marketing, both from Butler University. He comes to Santa Cruz with his wife, Patty, and three children, Kate, Will, and Zach.<br/>

width="267"/>Busy, multi-tasking students can now keep up with life at UC Santa Cruz, thanks to a brand-new free iPhone app with regularly updated campus news, videos, photos, events, and even an emergency feed.</p>
<p>The app&#8212;featuring the smiling, bespectacled Sammy the Slug mascot&#8212;went live this week, thanks to a group effort involving a current student, a recent graduate, and staff from the University Relations and Information Technology Services divisions.</p>
<p>Associate Vice Chancellor for Communications and Marketing Barry Shiller said the Slug app is a convenient source of information, images, and stories "for people who are already engaged with the campus, or who want to learn more about us."</p>
<p>Among the user-friendly features of this app: a map that uses GPS to help users pinpoint their location in relationship to a UCSC destination; photo profiles of UCSC's people, architecture, and environment; the latest campus news; and an interface with UCSC's online calendar.</p>
<p>The app is the brainchild of Kushyar Kasraie, 24 (College Nine, '09), and current student Jamieson Johnson, 22, who came up with the idea last year.&#160; Johnson is taking time off to work full-time in their company, <a href="http://ezaxess.com/">EZ Axess, Inc</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>The duo advanced to the semi-finals of the UCSC Business Plan Competition on campus two years in a row&#8212;in spring of 2009 and spring of 2010&#8212;with their iPhone app idea.</p>
<p>Last year they took their idea to University Relations. Staff in UR's Communications &amp; Marketing group worked with Kasraie and Johnson on a Version 1.0 design and brought ITS and other key collaborators on board. The collaborative effort was also supported by staff from Business &amp; Administrative Services and Student Affairs.&#160;</p>
<p>Use of the app is not limited to UCSC students.</p>
<p>"Alumni, parents&#8211;anyone&#8211;can also download it," Johnson said.</p>
<p>Kasraie, who majored in business management economics, said the idea of an iPhone app occurred to him when he was still at UCSC.</p>
<p>"As a student, I noticed many people were using iPhones and iPod Touches around the campus," he said.</p>
<p>The app, he added, "allows UCSC to engage students, and the campus community, on the go."</p>

<br/>
The 90-minute live, interactive webcast will take place on Friday, September 24, beginning at 10 a.m. This is a vital opportunity to learn about the recommendations of the UC Post-Employment Benefits Task Force, as well as other matters. Information about the task force's recommendations is available online at <a href="#">http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/ouruniversity/0810/</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Panelists will include Nathan Brostrom, executive vice president for business operations; Peter Taylor, chief financial officer; Dwaine Duckett, vice president for human resources; and Provost Lawrence Pitts, executive vice president for academic affairs of the UC system. The event will be moderated by Penelope Herbert, staff advisor-designate to the Regents.<br/>
<br/>
Faculty, staff, and retirees from across the university will be able to view the webcast by going to <a href="#">http://www.ustream.tv/ucevents</a>.<br/>
<br/>

<p>Donors gave $1.2 million for undergraduate student support, which includes scholarships, up from $858,000 last year. A total of 12,421 donors were responsible for 16,578 gifts and pledges to the campus during the 2009-10 fiscal year, contributing over $20 million in private fundraising.</p>
<p>"Our outstanding students will benefit directly from this extraordinary philanthropy in support of UC Santa Cruz," said Felicia E. McGinty, vice chancellor of Student Affairs. "Scholarships help students fully engage in the unique UCSC experience, fulfilling their academic goals and helping them access outside-the-classroom opportunities."</p>
<p>She noted that this is the second year in a row that giving to undergraduate student support has increased, after a decline in 2007-2008.</p>
<p>While fundraising was down overall compared with last year&#8212;reflecting the current difficult economic conditions&#8212;there were plenty of bright spots in the campus's philanthropic efforts<strong>.</strong> Another dramatic increase can be seen in unrestricted campus-wide giving&#8212;which does not include gifts specifically earmarked to departments.</p>
<p>Unrestricted giving allows for critical support to areas that are in greatest need.</p>
<p>The figure&#8212; $307,000&#8212;is up 23 percent from last year's figure of $249,000.</p>
<p>Chancellor George R. Blumenthal noted that combined giving to graduate and undergraduate student support reached $1.6 million during this difficult economic period.</p>
<p>"Philanthropy has the power to transform people's lives," Blumenthal said. "We are grateful for this support, which makes such a difference for students. With private giving, our campus is cultivating a vibrant learning community, one that takes us to the next level of academic distinction and prepares our students to make meaningful contributions to society."</p>
<p>The past fiscal year included many highlights of private giving:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 300 people attended the seventh annual UC Santa Cruz Scholarship Benefit Dinner at the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose, which raised nearly $175,000 for undergraduate scholarships.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Students with ties to Kings and Tulare Counties in the Central Valley will benefit from a $75,000 scholarship fund established by alumnus Thomas Akin and his wife, Karen.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Hierarchical Systems Research Foundation, a family foundation, donated $25,000 to support student scholarships in science and engineering.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Bank of America contributed $12,500 toward Regents Scholarships for undergraduates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generous friends of the campus also helped fund research, facilities, and more: <span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Cisco Systems, Inc., gave nearly $900,000 to Computer Engineering, establishing a lab for network education and a network engineering research partnership benefiting graduate students.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Private gifts helped McHenry Library meet requirements for a $700,000 challenge grant from the Kresge Foundation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A three-year, $580,000 grant from the W.T. Grant Foundation funded education researchers to improve academic outcomes for Latino high school students.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>University Professor Sandra Faber and her husband, Andrew, gave $180,000 to establish an Astronomy gift fund, which matched Irene Osterbrock&#8217;s $75,000 gift to establish the Osterbrock Graduate Leadership Award in Astronomy and Astrophysics.</li>

<p>The highlight of the event will be the opening of a new shark and ray pool inside the center. This hands-on exhibit will give visitors a chance to see local sharks and rays up close and feel the "dermal teeth" that give sharkskin its sandpaper texture. While getting to know these fascinating creatures, visitors will also learn about research and conservation efforts. Sharks are top ocean predators and play a vital role in marine ecosystems, but many species around the world are in trouble. Sharks grow slowly and produce relatively few offspring. Pressure from fishing and habitat loss have contributed to alarming declines in some populations.</p>
<p>Special demonstrations, raffles, and tours will also take place throughout the afternoon, and the Ocean Discovery Shop will offer a 10-percent discount on all items. The center's classrooms will be open for demonstrations and self-guided activities.</p>
<p>The Seymour Marine Discovery Center opened to the public in March 2000. More than 60,000 people visit the center every year. Throughout 2010, children turning 10 years old will receive free entry during their birthday month.</p>
<p>Overlooking the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, the Seymour Center is a "living classroom" featuring aquariums, exhibits, touch tanks, whale skeletons, full-scale elephant seal models, the Ocean Discovery Shop, and unsurpassed ocean vistas. The aquariums and exhibits feature the everyday tools of ocean exploration and focus on research conducted by scientists locally and around the world. Interactive stations provide hands-on learning experiences, and docents lead tours and bring marine science to life. The Seymour Center is located at the end of Delaware Avenue in Santa Cruz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="45bb9631807270460012e33da6e00603"><name>norris-lecture</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Marine experts to discuss a decade of ocean discoveries in annual Norris Lecture on Thursday, October 7 </title><summary>A panel of four UCSC marine scientists will discuss a decade of ocean discoveries in the annual Ken Norris Memorial Lecture at the Seymour Center on Thursday, October 7.</summary><keywords>Seymour Center, marine science, Mark Carr, Mary Silver, Sharon Stammerjohn, Gary Griggs</keywords><start-date>1285574400000</start-date><display-name>Marine experts to discuss a decade of ocean discoveries... </display-name><path>/2010/09/norris-lecture</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/09/norris-lecture</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1285365142988</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1285365775226</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value><value>Ocean Sciences</value><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/09/images/panelists-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/09/images/panelists-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>panelists-300.jpg</name><display-name>panelists-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>85969</file-size><width>300</width><height>424</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/09/images/panelists-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/09/images/panelists-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>panelists-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>panelists-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23179</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>UCSC marine scientists Mark Carr, Mary Silver, Gary Griggs, and Sharon Stammerjohn (clockwise from top left) will discuss a decade of ocean discoveries.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A panel of four marine scientists from UC Santa Cruz will discuss a decade of ocean discoveries in the annual Ken Norris Memorial Lecture at the Seymour Center at Long Marine Laboratory on Thursday, October 7, at 7 p.m. Tickets for the event, "A Decade of Marine Science: Lessons Learned," are now on sale at the Seymour Center ($6 general admission; $4 for members).</p>
<p>In keeping with the upcoming <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/shark-tank.html">celebration</a> of the Seymour Center's 10th anniversary on October 10, the theme of the discussion will be the "top ten things we've learned about the ocean over the past ten years." The panelists are experts in a broad range of ocean-related subjects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mark Carr, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, is an expert on coastal biology, marine protected areas, conservation, and fisheries.</li>
<li>Mary Silver, professor emeritus of ocean sciences, is a leading authority on plankton, the biological productivity of the oceans, harmful algal blooms, and biological oceanography.</li>
<li>Sharon Stammerjohn, assistant professor of ocean sciences, studies ocean circulation and the effects of climate change in the Arctic and Antarctic.</li>
<li>Gary Griggs, distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences and director of UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences, is an expert on coastal geology, geologic hazards, coastal erosion, shorelines and beaches, and sea level rise.</li>
</ul>
<p>"The last decade has produced revolutionary changes in how we investigate the oceans, in our understanding of how they work, and in the state of ocean health, as well as breakthroughs in developing new approaches for protecting the sea," Griggs said.</p>
<p>The moderator of the panel will be Mike Jung, publisher of the <em>Santa Cruz Sentinel</em> and a member of the Friends of Long Marine Lab Board of Directors. For more information about this event, please call the Seymour Center at (831) 459-3800.</p>

<p>UCSC's Ph.D. programs in earth sciences, astronomy and astrophysics, ecology and evolutionary biology, electrical engineering, and physics are among the best in the country, based on the NRC's assessment of research activity in each field. Research activity is a widely accepted measure of program excellence.</p>
<p>"This is a wonderful endorsement of five excellent programs and a recognition of our place at the forefront of graduate education," said Alison Galloway, executive vice chancellor and campus provost.</p>
<p>Other doctoral programs that showed distinction in research activity include molecular, cellular and developmental biology; literature; history; chemistry and biochemistry; computer science; mathematics; ocean sciences; and international economics.</p>
<p>The long-anticipated report on doctoral programs in the United States, which was made available online, is based on copious amounts of data provided in 2005-06 about more than 5,000 programs at 212 institutions across the country. The complexity of the undertaking is underscored by the infrequency of these reports: NRC's last survey was conducted in 1993, and the results were published in 1995.</p>
<p>"As a relatively young campus with a fast-growing portfolio of graduate programs, UCSC did extremely well," said Galloway, UCSC's chief academic officer.</p>
<p>The NRC assessed research activity by evaluating four factors: Publications per faculty member; citations per publication; percent of faculty with grants; and awards per faculty member.</p>
<p>Additional highlights of the report include strong showings by astronomy and astrophysics, computer engineering, and ocean sciences, based on citations per publication, or the number of times scholarly papers authored by UCSC researchers in each field were cited by others&#8212;an indication of the publication's impact. In addition, physics emerged as a top producer of publications-per-faculty-member.</p>
<p>"UCSC is known for pioneering scholarship that transforms disciplines," said Galloway. "The NRC results reinforce our reputation for breakthrough scholarship that moves entire fields."</p>
<p>"As we celebrate our 45<sup>th</sup> anniversary, the spirit of innovation that built this campus is alive and well," said Galloway.</p>
<p>Galloway noted, however, that the NRC's snapshot view of UCSC is already outdated. Today, UCSC offers 32 doctoral programs, only 20 of which were included in the NRC survey.</p>
<p>"This is necessarily an incomplete picture of our doctoral programs, but more programs will meet the criteria for inclusion in the NRC's next survey," said Galloway.</p>
<p>The NRC is the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences. A private, nonprofit organization, the NRC gathers, analyzes, and shares information, producing more than 200 reports each year. Its mandate includes improving government decision making and public policy.</p>
<p>The council's report, entitled "A Data-Based Assessment of Research-Doctorate Programs in the United States," has been highly anticipated in higher education circles, where the NRC's analyses are regarded as a credible measure of program quality.</p>
<p>To increase the statistical accuracy of its findings, the NRC gathered data to evaluate programs by two measures: perception and objective metrics. In a departure from prior practice, the NRC did not provide a ranked list of programs.</p>
<p>Founded in 1965, UC Santa Cruz has established a distinctive role in the UC system as a major research university that provides a high-quality living-and-learning experience. UCSC's location on the shores of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, and its proximity to Silicon Valley, have fostered excellence in academic programs and research endeavors, and contributed to a culture of interdisciplinary engagement and entrepreneurial partnership. The campus recently set a new record for sponsored research awards, raising $148 million to support graduate students and pay for equipment and materials. With talented faculty who honor the campus's enduring commitment to excellence in teaching, UCSC demonstrates that cutting-edge research and high-quality teaching are mutually reinforcing. Total campus enrollment this academic year is projected to be 16,730.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/24184</url><title>UC Office of the President's NRC press release</title></related-links><related-links><page type="page"><content></content><path>/2010/09/galloway-nrc</path><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><link>site://news/2010/09/galloway-nrc</link><site>news</site><name>galloway-nrc</name><display-name>Results of National Research Council's survey of doctoral programs</display-name><title>Results of National Research Council's survey of doctoral programs</title><summary>The National Research Council's long-awaited survey of doctoral programs has finally been released.</summary><keywords>NRC, national research council, rankings, graduate, doctoral, earth sciences, astronomy and astrophysics, ecology and evolutionary biology, electrical engineering, physics</keywords><start-date>Sep 28, 2010 1:00 AM</start-date></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url/><title>Campus Provost Alison Galloway's campus message</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/news/article?ID=1878</url><title>Electrical Engineering story</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/news/article?ID=1870</url><title>Computer Engineering story</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="59779511807270460012e33d8cd33894"><name>galloway-nrc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Results of National Research Council's survey of doctoral programs</title><summary>The National Research Council's long-awaited survey of doctoral programs has finally been released.</summary><keywords>NRC, national research council, rankings, graduate, doctoral, earth sciences, astronomy and astrophysics, ecology and evolutionary biology, electrical engineering, physics</keywords><start-date>1285660800000</start-date><display-name>Results of National Research Council's survey of doctoral programs</display-name><path>/2010/09/galloway-nrc</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/09/galloway-nrc</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1285696230581</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1285696555300</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>The National Research Council's (NRC) long-awaited <a href="http://www.nap.edu/rdp">survey of doctoral programs</a>, "A Data-Based Assessment of Research-Doctorate Programs in the United States," has finally been released. Based on 2005-06 data, this survey includes more than 5,000 programs at 212 institutions.&#160; The NRC rankings provide ranges of assessment, utilizing a number of variables that address research activity, graduate student support, and diversity. The methodology is extremely complex and has been undergoing revisions up to the time of final release of the data.<br/>
<br/>
Nineteen of our current 32 doctoral programs are covered under the rankings. One additional program is considered an "emerging field" and was assessed but not ranked. Our remaining programs were established too recently to qualify for the survey or are in fields not covered by the survey.&#160; <br/>
<br/>
There are two overall "illustrative" rankings based 1) on regression (R) from perceived quality (i.e. the variable strengths in highly regarded programs were used to produce a regression formula) and 2) from a survey of the variables seen as most significant in producing quality programs (S). Results are presented as rankings with 90 percent confidence intervals rather than the list of institutions in rank order.&#160; <br/>
<br/>
As a relatively young campus with a fast-growing portfolio of graduate programs, UCSC did extremely well. Under the R rankings, Earth and Planetary Sciences and Ocean Sciences placed within the top quartile. Also well placed are MCD Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Physics, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Literature, Linguistics, Environmental Studies and Anthropology.&#160; <br/>
<br/>
Under the second assessment (S), the high-quality programs, seen as among the most attractive to faculty and students, include Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Electrical Engineering, Astronomy and Astrophysics, Earth and Planetary Sciences, and Physics. Several more programs are within the upper half of the rankings, including MCD Biology, Ocean Sciences, Computer Science, Anthropology and International Economics.<br/>
<br/>
The NRC rankings can be important tools for recruitment of graduate students and faculty. The complexity of the current survey will take considerable time to digest and programs will be able to utilize these data to identify their own strengths.&#160; Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Herbie Lee and Director of Institutional Research Julian Fernald will be conducting open sessions to provide a grounding in the methodology and the ways in which the campus and departments can utilize the data access to best understand their status. A <a href="nrc-report.xml">press release</a> on the results also is available online.<br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Faculty, Staff, and Graduate Students</audience><admin>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="59ea2d88807270460012e33d64cd30d9"><name>chancellor-fall</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Fall Quarter greetings</title><summary>Fall Quarter is off to a great start, writes Chancellor Blumenthal.</summary><keywords>blumenthal, chancellor, fall quarter, greetings, administrative message</keywords><start-date>1285574400000</start-date><display-name>Fall Quarter greetings</display-name><path>/2010/09/chancellor-fall</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/09/chancellor-fall</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1285703740603</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1285704712479</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Welcome to Fall Quarter 2010! If <a href="move-in1.xml">move-in</a> is any indication, we're off to a great start.</p>
<p>My wife, Kelly, and I spent an afternoon <a href="move-in-slideshow.html">greeting students</a> and their family members, and the excitement was palpable. Talking with parents, I was struck by the number of UCSC alumni whose children are enrolling this fall. That's a strong endorsement as we celebrate our 45th year.</p>
<p>We also begin this year with a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/galloway-announcement.html">new Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor</a> <a href="galloway-announcement.xml"></a>(CP/EVC), Professor Alison Galloway. Alison is an accomplished scholar and an experienced manager, and I am extremely pleased that she has agreed to help lead this campus as the CP/EVC.</p>
<p>I'm relieved to report that there appears to be some movement in Sacramento toward a state budget. I will of course keep the campus informed about those developments and what they may mean for UCSC.</p>
<p>Before we close the book on summer, I must share a few highlights. I had the pleasure of accompanying astronomer Jerry Nelson to Norway, where he received the <a href="kavli-ceremony.xml">Kavli Prize in Astrophysics</a>, widely considered the "Nobel Prize of astronomy." I felt great pride as an image of our campus entrance filled the screen and the King of Norway presented the prize. The Kavli is a powerful reminder of the quality of UCSC's people and programs.</p>
<p>Our students continue to excel. Most recently, five doctoral candidates and one June graduate won prestigious <a href="fulbright-winners.xml">Fulbright fellowships</a> for overseas study this year.</p>
<p>Finally, the campus set a new record for sponsored research awards, raising an impressive $148 million in 2009-10. These funds directly support the research mission of the university by supporting graduate students and paying for equipment and materials that ultimately enrich the educational environment for everyone. Congratulations to all who helped reach this milestone.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we are updating the UCSC web site. Check out our new <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/index.html">home page</a>, and watch as new pages are unveiled throughout the year. If you have an iPhone, download the new <a href="iphone-app.xml">UC Santa Cruz app</a>! And keep an eye out for CP/EVC Galloway and me. We look forward to interacting with many of you as the year unfolds. Until then, you can always write to me directly at chancellor@ucsc.edu.</p>

<p>A team of planet hunters led by astronomers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the Carnegie Institution of Washington has announced the discovery of an Earth-sized planet (three times the mass of Earth) orbiting a nearby star at a distance that places it squarely in the middle of the star's "habitable zone," where liquid water could exist on the planet's surface. If confirmed, this would be the most Earth-like exoplanet yet discovered and the first strong case for a potentially habitable one.</p>
<p>To astronomers, a "potentially habitable" planet is one that could sustain life, not necessarily one that humans would consider a nice place to live. Habitability depends on many factors, but liquid water and an atmosphere are among the most important.</p>
<p>"Our findings offer a very compelling case for a potentially habitable planet," said Steven Vogt, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. "The fact that we were able to detect this planet so quickly and so nearby tells us that planets like this must be really common."</p>
<p>The findings are based on 11 years of observations at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. "Advanced techniques combined with old-fashioned ground-based telescopes continue to lead the exoplanet revolution," said Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution. "Our ability to find potentially habitable worlds is now limited only by our telescope time."</p>
<p>Vogt and Butler lead the Lick-Carnegie Exoplanet Survey. The team's new findings are reported in a paper to be published in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em> and posted online at <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5733">arXiv.org</a>. Coauthors include associate research scientist Eugenio Rivera of UC Santa Cruz; associate astronomer Nader Haghighipour of the University of Hawaii-Manoa; and research scientists Gregory Henry and Michael Williamson of Tennessee State University.</p>
<p>The paper reports the discovery of two new planets around the nearby red dwarf star Gliese 581. This brings the total number of known planets around this star to six, the most yet discovered in a planetary system other than our own solar system. Like our solar system, the planets around Gliese 581 have nearly circular orbits.</p>
<p>The most interesting of the two new planets is Gliese 581g, with a mass three to four times that of the Earth and an orbital period of just under 37 days. Its mass indicates that it is probably a rocky planet with a definite surface and that it has enough gravity to hold on to an atmosphere, according to Vogt.</p>
<p>Gliese 581, located 20 light years away from Earth in the constellation Libra, has a somewhat checkered history of habitable-planet claims. Two previously detected planets in the system lie at the edges of the habitable zone, one on the hot side (planet c) and one on the cold side (planet d). While some astronomers still think planet d may be habitable if it has a thick atmosphere with a strong greenhouse effect to warm it up, others are skeptical. The newly discovered planet g, however, lies right in the middle of the habitable zone.</p>
<p>"We had planets on both sides of the habitable zone--one too hot and one too cold--and now we have one in the middle that's just right," Vogt said.</p>
<p>The planet is tidally locked to the star, meaning that one side is always facing the star and basking in perpetual daylight, while the side facing away from the star is in perpetual darkness. One effect of this is to stabilize the planet's surface climates, according to Vogt. The most habitable zone on the planet's surface would be the line between shadow and light (known as the "terminator"), with surface temperatures decreasing toward the dark side and increasing toward the light side.</p>
<p>"Any emerging life forms would have a wide range of stable climates to choose from and to evolve around, depending on their longitude," Vogt said.</p>
<p>The researchers estimate that the average surface temperature of the planet is between -24 and 10 degrees Fahrenheit (-31 to -12 degrees Celsius). Actual temperatures would range from blazing hot on the side facing the star to freezing cold on the dark side.&#160;</p>
<p>If Gliese 581g has a rocky composition similar to the Earth's, its diameter would be about 1.2 to 1.4 times that of the Earth. The surface gravity would be about the same or slightly higher than Earth's, so that a person could easily walk upright on the planet, Vogt said.</p>
<p>The new findings are based on 11 years of observations of Gliese 581 using the HIRES spectrometer (designed by Vogt) on the Keck I Telescope at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The spectrometer allows precise measurements of a star's radial velocity (its motion along the line of sight from Earth), which can reveal the presence of planets. The gravitational tug of an orbiting planet causes periodic changes in the radial velocity of the host star. Multiple planets induce complex wobbles in the star's motion, and astronomers use sophisticated analyses to detect planets and determine their orbits and masses.</p>
<p>"It's really hard to detect a planet like this," Vogt said. "Every time we measure the radial velocity, that's an evening on the telescope, and it took more than 200 observations with a precision of about 1.6 meters per second to detect this planet."</p>
<p>To get that many radial velocity measurements (238 in total), Vogt's team combined their HIRES observations with published data from another group led by the Geneva Observatory (HARPS, the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planetary Search project).</p>
<p>In addition to the radial velocity observations, coauthors Henry and Williamson made precise night-to-night brightness measurements of the star with one of Tennessee State University's robotic telescopes. "Our brightness measurements verify that the radial velocity variations are caused by the new orbiting planet and not by any process within the star itself," Henry said.</p>
<p>The researchers also explored the implications of this discovery with respect to the number of stars that are likely to have at least one potentially habitable planet. Given the relatively small number of stars that have been carefully monitored by planet hunters, this discovery has come surprisingly soon.</p>
<p>"If these are rare, we shouldn't have found one so quickly and so nearby," Vogt said. "The number of systems with potentially habitable planets is probably on the order of 10 or 20 percent, and when you multiply that by the hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way, that's a large number. There could be tens of billions of these systems in our galaxy."</p>

<br/>
Grande wrote the first 80 pages of the novel--a poignant story about immigration and family based on her own personal experience--as part of her senior project in the UCSC Literature Department.<br/>
<br/>
But after the initial success of the book, Grande began to get second novel jitters, wondering how she could possibly follow up with another successful book.&#160; <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I&#160;had this paralyzing fear that I wouldn't be able to write a good second novel,&#8221; Grande recalled. &#8220;There was a time when I was working on the book when I couldn't write for weeks because I was letting my fear block my creativity.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
She needn&#8217;t have worried.<br/>
<br/>
Since its publication last year, her sophomore novel, <em>Dancing with Butterflies</em> (Washington Square Press)--a story of four women in a Los Angeles-based folklorico group--has been steadily garnering acclaim.<br/>
<br/>
This past summer, Grande received the <em>2010 International Latino Book Award, Best Women&#8217;s Issues</em>. Earlier this year, the book was chosen as a 2010 Las Comadres &amp; Friends National Latino Book Club selection.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Right before the book came out <em>Publisher's Weekly</em> gave it a "starred" review and after that I was no longer afraid, but thrilled,&#8221; said Grande.&#160; <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;A few months ago I got an e-mail from my UCSC creative writing teacher, Micah Perks, telling me that she loved the book and that she was proud of me,&#8221; Grande added. &#8220;I was happy to hear this from her, and to know that even though I was her student 11 years ago, she is still keeping track of what I do.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Grande is currently&#160; helping to coordinate the 2010 Latino Book &amp; Family Festival--the largest gathering of Latino authors in the country--set for October 9 and 10 at Cal State Los Angeles.&#160;The event will feature more than 120 Latino authors and nearly 50 panels, readings and workshops to choose from throughout the weekend. <br/>
<br/>
Now living in Los Angeles, Grande has returned to UCSC and the Central Coast for a number of author appearances this year. She was the keynote speaker for the 2010 California Association of Bilingual Education conference in San Jose. <br/>
<br/>
The city of Watsonville also chose her first novel <em>Across a Hundred Mountains</em> for its community program, "On the Same Page." And Bookshop Santa Cruz selected <em>Across a Hundred Mountains</em> for its community book group.&#160; <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Santa Cruz is like my second home,&#8221; said Grande. &#8220;I have friends there, my college professors whom I am still in touch with, and my younger sister lives in Watsonville.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Grande is currently working on a memoir, but still plans to write more fiction in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I want to write an inspirational story for young Latino youth,&#8221; said Grande. &#8220;In this memoir, I am writing about the years I spent in Mexico without my parents, then coming to the U.S. and having to not only learn English and&#160;make my way in a new country, but also get to know my father all over again--a father I hadn't seen since I was two years old.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;But I do have other novels planned, as soon as I am done with the memoir,&#8221; Grande added. &#8220;I have found it quite difficult to write non-fiction, and can't wait to get back to fiction where I can let my imagination go where it wants to go.&#8221;<br/>

<p>The discovery of an Earth-sized planet where liquid water could exist on the surface has long been considered a major milestone for planet hunters. This breakthrough constitutes the first strong case for a planet that could sustain life, and it raises profound questions about the possible existence of billions of similar planets within our own Milky Way.</p>
<p>We congratulate Steve and his UCSC colleague, associate research scientist Eugenio Rivera, as well as Paul Butler at the Carnegie Institution of Washington and the rest of their team. This is another example of the discipline-transforming work led by UCSC researchers. We are very proud of their accomplishments.</p>

Held in conjunction with the California Native Plant Society, the sale opens early (from 10 a.m. to noon) for members of either organization. Memberships will be on sale at the gate.</p>
<p>The sale will feature an unusual selection of native and non-native species chosen to thrive in local gardens. A complete list is available on the <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu/">Arboretum's web site</a>. Fall is a good time for planting because roots can establish themselves during the rainy season, which makes for a stronger and healthier plant to withstand the dry summer, according to Stephen McCabe, director of education at the Arboretum.</p>
<p>After budget cutbacks a year ago forced the Arboretum to lay off staff and become financially self-sufficient, volunteers stepped up in a big way, McCabe said. "Volunteers have helped students and staff propagate and repot beautiful plants in time for this fall planting season," he said.</p>
<p>A new plant available this year that has never been sold before is a showy seedling heather called <em>Erica</em> 'Ron&#8217;s White,' which dangles its long tubular flowers below the branches. It was named after the staff member who discovered it, Ron Arruda, now retired from his position as curator of the South African plant collection.</p>
<p>The curator of the Australian Plant Collection, Melinda Kralj, speaks highly of an Australian fuchsia called <em>Correa glabra</em> 'Cooliban River,' which is new to the U.S. market. The lime-green to yellowish flowers are subtle against the foliage, and the plants look greener and lusher than one would expect for their thrifty use of water. It has been introduced through the Arboretum's "Koala Blooms" program.</p>
<p>The sale will also feature some dramatic and lesser-known members of the protea family: Australian banksias with large, bottlebrush-like flowers and South African leucadendrons with attractive foliage that come in yellow, burgundy-red, and tricolored variegated forms. There will also be a variety of manzanitas and other California natives.</p>
<p>A variety of succulents from California, Mexico and South Africa will also be available. These are perfect plants for dorm rooms as well as the home garden, according to McCabe.</p>

<p>On Friday, October 22, the campus's founding history and its leadership in marine science will be celebrated at UC Santa Cruz's fourth annual Founders Celebration. The theme of this celebratory day is "Decades of Discovery." Through the hard work, support, and accomplishments of the day's honorees, UC Santa Cruz has been able to build upon the dreams of the people who founded this extraordinary campus. It is my sincere hope that you can join me at these splendid events.</p>
<p>In the daytime, join us for the UCSC Foundation Forum: Report from the Gulf, a discussion of the status and implications of the recent gulf oil spill with guest lecturer and Foundation Medal recipient Jean-Michel Cousteau and NPR correspondent Richard Harris (see short bios on each below).

This week's cyber security "Tip of the Week" from ITS is to <strong>shut down or restart your computer at least weekly</strong>--and whenever your programs tell you to in order to install updates.</p>
<p>Updates (also known as "patches") help protect your computer from attackers and some kinds of malicious software. Some updates require you to restart your computer for them to go into effect, and you may or may not be notified when this is the case. Whether your computer is being patched for you or you do it yourself, shutting down or restarting your computer regularly helps to make sure software and security updates are properly installed and are protecting your computer and information.</p>
