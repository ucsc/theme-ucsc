<ul>
<li>December 24, 27, 30, and 31 are paid university holidays</li>
<li>December 23, 28, and 29 are not paid university holidays</li>
</ul>
<p>These curtailment days may result in employees using vacation, accrued compensatory time off, or leave without pay for December 23, 28, and 29, 2010. For employees who may not have sufficient accumulated vacation, up to three (3) days of vacation leave may be used in advance of actual accruals during the campus curtailment period. In addition, those employees normally required to wait six (6) months before using accrued vacation will be allowed to use their vacation even if the required waiting period has not been completed.</p>
<p>Due to the diverse responsibilities of academic appointees and the flexibility in performing their obligations, it is anticipated that some academic appointees will continue working during campus closure.</p>
<p>Units planning to maintain operations as usual during any time of the winter curtailment must receive approval from their respective Principal Officers or designee and should refer to the &#8220;Exceptions to Campus Closure&#8221; memo that will be forthcoming in November. This memo will explain the required procedure to ensure that heat is supplied to appropriate working areas.</p>

<br/>
Titled <em>Cultivating a Movement: A History of Sustainable Agriculture and Organic Farming on California&#8217;s Central Coast</em>, the archive is now available on the UCSC Library&#8217;s <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/cultiv/home">web site</a>.</p>
<p>An exhibit featuring images and excerpts from the new oral history archive will run at both McHenry Library and the Science and Engineering Library on the UCSC campus through December 10.</p>
<p>U.S. Representative Sam Farr will be the guest speaker at a reception for the exhibit to be held on Thursday, October 14, from 4 to 6 pm at the UCSC Science and Engineering Library&#8217;s Current Periodicals Room. Admission is free.</p>
<p>Congressman Farr has been a champion of organic farming since his service in the Peace Corps in Colombia in 1964.<br/>
<br/>
While in the California State Assembly, Farr authored the 1990 California Organic Standards Act, the first state law defining organic agriculture. This legislation became the basis for the National Organic Program&#8217;s federal organic standards.<br/>
<br/>
Farr now serves as co-chair of the National Organic Caucus in the House of Representatives and is vice chair of the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration.<br/>
<br/>
In Congress, he has insisted that USDA research stations include a focus on organic agriculture. More recently, Farr has worked to promote the use of salad bars in school cafeterias.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It&#8217;s been exciting to see the evolution of the organics industry, to join with the pioneers of this movement to shape local, state and federal policy for organic growers,&#8221; said Farr.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;As the nation becomes more and more conscious of what we&#8217;re eating, and especially what our children are eating, I think organics will continue to play a very important role,&#8221; he added.<br/>
<br/>
Several years in the making, the documentary archive project at the UCSC Library includes interviews with farm advisers, activists, educators, researchers, policymakers, food distributors, and other shapers of the region&#8217;s past 40 years of agricultural history.<br/>
<br/>
While the project focuses on developments in California&#8217;s Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Benito, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties, many of the interviewees have influenced the movement for sustainable food systems at the national and international level.<br/>

The lecture is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Mace, who serves as executive director of the <a href="http://www.opc.ca.gov/">California Ocean Protection Council</a> and assistant secretary for coastal matters, grew up along the California coast. She has spent many years exploring the coast's shores and depths, including diving for a sunken Spanish galleon off Point Reyes and piloting a one-person submersible near the Farallon Islands.</p>
<p>Understanding the value of a coastal economy to all Californians, Mace is dedicated to ensuring resource management decisions are informed with sound science, are outcome driven, and cost effective.</p>
<p>Her lecture is titled "The Future of Our Oceans: The Time is Now." Mace will discuss the state of the oceans and the importance of science in decision making as well as some highlights from the "<a href="http://www.cce.csus.edu/conferences/cnra/cwo2010/genInfo.htm">California and the World Ocean 2010 Conference</a>" held last month in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Mace holds a doctorate in ecology from UC Davis and relies on her background in marine ecology and ocean policy to guide the state in developing policies that promote the sustainable use of California&#8217;s ocean ecosystem. She is a former executive director of the <a href="http://www.calost.org/">California Ocean Science Trust</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing objective, high-quality science to decision makers.</p>
<p>She also served as science advisor to the Ocean Protection Council created as part of the California Ocean Protection Act and signed into law in 2004 by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. On the federal level, Mace worked as a Knauss marine policy fellow for the U.S. Senate&#8217;s Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and at the state level as a California Sea Grant fellow at the California Natural Resources Agency.</p>
<p>The Keeley Lecture series is named in honor of <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/03-27/keeley.asp">Fred Keeley</a>, a Santa Cruz County civic leader and former member of the State Assembly, who for many years has helped shape environmental policy in California. It aims to foster discussion and awareness of major environmental challenges and the role of environmental policy in reaching solutions.</p>
<p>"Amber Mace continues in the tradition of previous presenters," Keeley said. "A tradition of outstanding thinkers and practitioners who are leading positive change in state and national policy regarding the multiple challenges to our natural environment.&#160; It is an honor to have her present this year's lecture."</p>
<p>Previous speakers have been former U.S. Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt; Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich, author of <em>The Population Bomb</em>; climate expert Benjamin Santer; and Jane Lubchenco, now administrator of the <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> (NOAA).</p>
<p>Mace earned a bachelor's degree in geography from UC Berkeley. Before graduate school at UC Davis and the Bodega Marine Laboratory, she took part as an archeological research diver in a NOAA and National Parks Service-led search for the wreck of the <em>San Agustin</em> &#8211; a Spanish galleon that sank off Point Reyes in 1595. She also was trained to pilot a one-person submersible through a NOAA/National Geographic Sustainable Seas Expedition to explore the depths of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary.</p>

The event is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Prusiner's talk will be the first Tony Fink Memorial Lecture, established this year to honor and celebrate the distinguished career of Anthony Fink, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, who died in 2008. Prusiner will discuss "Increasing evidence that prions cause most neurodegenerative diseases."</p>
<p>Prusiner is a professor of neurology and director of the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases at UC San Francisco. His discovery of the infectious proteins he named prions was unexpected and spurred vehement debate among scientists for many years. He described a novel disease paradigm, showing that prions cause disorders in humans that manifest variously as sporadic, inherited, or infectious illnesses.</p>
<p>In all prion diseases, a normal, benign cellular protein acquires an altered shape that results in pathological changes in the brain. The most common prion disease in humans is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Other, more common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and frontotemporal dementia have also been found to involve abnormal protein conformations. Prusiner's current research includes efforts to find drug therapies that retard neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and prion diseases.</p>
<p>Prusiner received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1997. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society, and is a foreign member of the Royal Society, London. His other awards and honors include the Potamkin Prize for Alzheimer's Disease Research from the American Academy of Neurology; the Richard Lounsbery Award for Extraordinary Scientific Research in Biology and Medicine from the National Academy of Sciences; the Gairdner Foundation International Award; and the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research.</p>
<p>The Tony Fink Memorial Lecture is funded by generous donations from alumni, faculty, and industry. Fink, who joined the UCSC faculty in 1969, was a leading authority on protein folding. He investigated how protein folding goes wrong in diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and he worked to design treatments to repair the damage or prevent it from happening. Widely respected in the scientific community for his research accomplishments, he received the Division of Physical &amp; Biological Sciences' Outstanding Faculty Award in 2007.</p>

<p>The Friends hope to carefully dismantle the historic barn, which dates to the late 1860S, and have it raised again, using a combination of new and salvaged salvageable beams and other wood.</p>
<p>But first the nonprofit group needs to have the barn studied and thoroughly inventoried to make sure the rebuilt version is a historically accurate reconstruction of&#160;the original barn.</p>
<p>The Friends got a boost this summer when a Los Gatos resident donated $15,000 worth of high quality old-growth timber from her foundering late 19<sup>th</sup>&#160;century barn, which yielded redwood planks and walls that could one day be part of a reconstructed hay barn.</p>
<p>The Friends group was also awarded a $4,000 grant by the&#160;National Trust for Historic Preservation&#160;from the California Endowed Fund. This money allowed the Friends group to pay for architectural drawings of the barn -- an essential part of the documentation process -- but the group must raise another $10,000 to $20,000 in matching funds to finish documenting the building. The group is trying to raise the money privately.</p>
<p>This week, Bill Hurley and Paul Oatman, contractors affiliated with the Timber Framers Guild (<a href="http://www.tfguild.org/">http://www.tfguild.org/</a>), measured and photographed the barn&#8217;s frame. Both are experts in the art of mortise-and-tenon construction, a traditional building method.</p>
<p>The Friends group&#8217;s ultimate goal is to recreate the barn as it was built. Such a project would cost at least $200,000.</p>
<p>&#8220;Loss of the building would be a major blow to the integrity of the historic district, and&#160;the opportunity for the campus to reuse the barn would be lost,&#8221; said Sally Morgan, UCSC senior environmental planner and archaeologist.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>First, I have begun a series of meetings and visits to help me better understand the campus from as many perspectives as possible. Even after many years of teaching, research, and academic and administrative leadership at UC Santa Cruz, there are many people I haven't met and there is a lot I haven't yet seen.</p>
<p>My immersion began during move-in weekend. I toured much of the campus and met many, many students and their families, as well as many staff members who helped move thousands of students onto campus. I visited The Village for the first time and checked out the newly expanded residences at Porter College, where hundreds of new transfer students reside.</p>
<p>I have also begun meeting with academic department chairs, and I look forward to meeting with colleagues from across campus, including those who work in the Physical Plant shops and the Delaware offices that house much of University Relations and Information Technology Services.</p>
<p>The list is long, but I believe it's essential that I meet students, staff, and faculty to hear their concerns and get feedback on the current state of the campus. This process will illuminate areas in which we excel, and it will reveal areas that need attention.</p>
<p>Second, I've begun working with academic deans and vice provosts to further define what features make UC Santa Cruz distinctive. This work complements our strategic academic planning and ongoing efforts to strengthen UCSC's public image. Our goals are to identify those characteristics that are central to our identity and ask the critical question "Can we do better in these areas?" We will determine which issues we can address in the near term, and which will take longer, and then identify measures by which we will know if we are improving. We are also preparing to begin the budget process for 2011-12. I will keep you informed of our progress</p>
<p>Finally, I value input and invite you to be in touch. Please write to me at <a href="mailto:cpevc@ucsc.edu">cpevc@ucsc.edu</a>. I may not be able to respond to every message, but I promise to read each one.</p>
<p>And if you see me on campus or in the community, please stop and say hello.</p>

<p>UC Santa Cruz will host its fourth annual Founders Day gala dinner at Santa Cruz's Cocoanut Grove on Friday, October 22, beginning at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Launched in 2007 to celebrate the spirit of community that resulted in the founding of a University of California campus in Santa Cruz, the event recognizes and honors extraordinary individuals and their outstanding contributions to society.</p>
<p>This year's featured honorees will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jean-Michel Cousteau (UC Santa Cruz Foundation Medal):</strong> Jean-Michel Cousteau, son of famed ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau, will be honored for his investigation of the world's oceans.</li>
<li><strong>S. H. Cowell Foundation (Fiat Lux Award):</strong> The S. H. Cowell Foundation will be honored for the seminal role of the Cowell family in the founding of UC Santa Cruz and recognized for its legacy of charitable support.</li>
<li><strong>Richard Harris (Alumni Achievement Award):</strong> Award-winning journalist Richard Harris (Crown '80) will be honored for his reporting on science issues for NPR.</li>
<li><strong>Paul Whitworth (Faculty Research Lecturer):</strong> Professor of Theatre Arts Paul Whitworth, a professional theater actor and director, as well as former artistic director of Shakespeare Santa Cruz, will be honored for his extensive experience in the performance of the plays of Shakespeare.</li>
</ul>
<p>With a theme of "Decades of Discovery," the evening will include a celebratory dinner, awards presentation ceremony, and video tributes to each of the award recipients. The dinner's honorary co-chairs will be Sam Farr, U.S. congressman (D-CA); Julie Packard, executive director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium and UCSC graduate (B.A. Biology, Crown College, 1974; M.A. Biology, 1978; and Jack O&#8217;Neill, founder of O&#8217;Neill.</p>
<p><strong>Jean-Michel Cousteau</strong> has investigated the world&#8217;s oceans aboard Calypso and Alcyone for much of his life. Honoring his heritage, Jean-Michel founded the nonprofit marine conservation and education organization Ocean Futures Society in 1999 to carry on this pioneering work. Ocean Futures Society aims to communicate the critical bond between people and the sea and the importance of wise environmental policy.</p>
<p>Cousteau has produced more than 80 films, received the Emmy, the Peabody Award, and the Cable Ace Award.</p>
<p>As chairman of the board and president of Ocean Futures Society, Jean-Michel travels the world, meeting with leaders and policymakers at the grassroots level and at the highest echelons of government and business. He is dedicated to educating young people, documenting stories of change and hope, and lending his reputation and support to energize alliances for positive change.</p>
<p><strong>The S. H. Cowell Foundation</strong> gave a generous gift of support toward the construction and naming of UCSC's first college and namesake landmark, Cowell College, as well as toward the construction of the Cowell Student Health Center. UC Santa Cruz is located on the previous site of Cowell Ranch.</p>
<p>Since 1964, the S. H. Cowell Foundation has made almost $4 million in gifts to UC Santa Cruz, including major support to the New Teacher Center and, most recently, a donation to help pay for the stabilization of the Cooperage in the Cowell Limeworks Historic District at the entrance to campus.</p>
<p>The foundation was established in 1956 through a bequest from Samuel Henry Cowell (1861-1955). His father, Henry Cowell, migrated to California during the Gold Rush and made a sizeable fortune in the building materials, drayage, and storage industries. S. H. continued and expanded the family business to include a significant real estate portfolio throughout Northern California--more than 80,000 acres of land in all.</p>
<p>Since its inception, the S. H. Cowell Foundation has made more than $246 million in grants to 2,017 organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Award-winning journalist Richard Harris</strong> (biology, Crown '80) reports on science issues for NPR's newsmagazines Morning Edition, All Things Considered, and Weekend Edition.</p>
<p>Harris, who joined NPR in 1986, has gone to the ends of the Earth for the media organization. He has traveled to Timbuktu to witness how climate change is forcing nomadic tribes to give up their wandering lives for a more sedentary existence; he's climbed the ice-shrouded Mt. Erebus in Antarctica to watch a volcanologist at work; he's stood beside a charismatic Maasai named Samuel Pilipili as the man administered daily doses of tuberculosis medicine to fellow tribe members in Kenya in an effort to cut the disease&#8217;s deadly toll.</p>
<p>All of this was done, not for adventure, but to help people learn about scientific discoveries and challenges in our world today.</p>
<p>Harris's latest assignment has been covering the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Whitworth</strong>, professor of Theatre Arts at UCSC, is also a professional actor and director. He earned an M.A. in modern languages (Spanish, Portuguese, Quechua, and Guarani) from University of St. Andrews in Scotland, after which he was awarded a Carnegie Scholarship to pursue research in 17th century Spanish drama at the University of Oxford.</p>
<p>His professional acting career began at the Royal Shakespeare Company where, between 1976 and 1982, he performed in numerous productions modern and Shakespearean in London, Newcastle, and Stratford-upon-Avon.</p>
<p>Whitworth's interest in combining performance and scholarship led him to Shakespeare Santa Cruz, where he has performed in, directed, or produced 56 shows. He led the company as artistic director from 1996 to 2007.</p>
<p>Whitworth has performed and directed in many regional theatres in the United Kingdom and in the United States and received numerous Bay Area awards for acting, directing, and producing.</p>

president of the Ocean Futures Society, and Richard Harris, science correspondent for National Public Radio, will discuss the impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico on Friday, October 22, at 12 noon at the Rittenhouse Building, 1375 Pacific Avenue, in downtown Santa Cruz. The event, "UCSC Foundation Forum: A Report from the Gulf," is free and open to the public. Seating is limited, and tickets can be reserved at santacruztickets.com.</p>
<p>The forum brings together two exceptionally well-informed observers from the front lines of the Gulf oil spill to discuss the lessons to be learned from this disaster. Harris, a UCSC alumnus and award-winning journalist, provided in-depth coverage of the spill for NPR as the events unfolded. He has continued to report on the ongoing investigations of the oil spill and its effects on Gulf ecosystems.</p>
<p>Cousteau, who made several trips to the Gulf with staff from his organization to investigate the impact of the oil spill, will present recent images from the Gulf of Mexico. The Ocean Futures Society is a nonprofit marine conservation and education organization that Cousteau founded in 1999 to carry on the work of his father, famed ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau.</p>
<p>Cousteau and Harris will both be honored by the UC Santa Cruz Foundation this month during the annual Founders Celebration. Cousteau will receive the Foundation Medal, which recognizes individuals of exceptionally distinguished achievement whose work and contribution to society illustrate the ideals and vision of UCSC. He will be honored for his investigation of the world's oceans.</p>

Their investigation of the formation and stability of family groups in desert night lizards <em>(Xantusia vigilis)</em> provides new insights into the evolution of cooperative behavior.</p>
<p>The researchers reported the results of a five-year study of desert night lizards in a paper published in the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</em> (published October 6 online in advance of print).</p>
<p>Alison Davis, who led the study as a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz and is currently a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley, said one of the unusual characteristics of desert night lizards is that they are viviparous, giving birth to live young instead of laying eggs. What really got her attention, however, was that both young and old lizards could be found huddling together every winter beneath fallen Joshua trees and other desert plant debris.</p>
<p>"This is remarkable, given the fact that in most species of lizards, individuals actively avoid each other," Davis said.</p>
<p>By conducting extensive genetic analyses of these winter social groups, the researchers found that young desert night lizards stay with their mother, father, and siblings for several years after birth. Some groups aggregated under the same fallen log year after year, forming what the researchers termed dynasties.</p>
<p>According to Davis, about 20 lizard species are thought to form family groups, and only two of those lay eggs. Viviparity (live birth) is crucial for the evolution of cooperative behaviors, she said.</p>
<p>"Viviparity provides the opportunity for prolonged interaction between the mother and offspring, which predisposes the animal to form a family group," Davis said. "The importance of parent-offspring interaction fits with what is currently understood about evolution of family groups and cooperative behaviors in birds and mammals."</p>
<p>In a classic study of animal social behavior published in 1995, Stephen Emlen of Cornell University described the evolution of family groups in birds and mammals and identified common themes and rules seen in both classes of animals. Davis's findings suggest that the same rules also apply to reptiles, which were not considered in Emlen's theory.</p>
<p>"Biologically, lizards are very different from both mammals and birds, yet a few species of lizards have evolved a social system around nuclear family members that is nearly identical to what we see in ground squirrels, primates, and woodpeckers," Davis said.</p>
<p>Coauthor Barry Sinervo, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, said this similarity between widely separated groups of animals makes the findings particularly interesting. "Establishing a common pattern for how kin-based groups and cooperative behaviors evolve across different taxa gives us an invaluable tool. It helps us to predict where similar group behaviors may be found in other species," he said.</p>
<p>The researchers faced some daunting challenges in their quest to understand the family ties that bind desert night lizards. The first hurdle was to capture the lizards. Adults, which are three to five inches long from the snout to the tip of the tail, are not so hard to find. The babies, however, are tiny, about the weight of a toothpick, and perfectly camouflaged, with skin the color of the sand where they are typically found half buried.</p>
<p>"You have to know what you are looking for," Davis said. She and other graduate and undergraduate students in the Sinervo lab looked under hundreds of logs in search of their shy subjects over the course of five years. They eventually marked 2,120 individual lizards for use in the study.</p>
<p>The second challenge was to determine if lizards living in aggregations were actually related and, if so, how closely. Davis worked with Yann Surget-Groba of Bangor University (U.K.) to sort out DNA microsatellite information collected from each lizard aggregation. She recalled Surget-Groba's amazement when he finished his analysis on one particular aggregation of 13 lizards and exclaimed, "They're <em>all</em> related!"</p>
<p>In this paper, the researchers did not address the advantages of baby lizards staying with their mothers for the first few years of life. The young appear to feed themselves and receive no direct care from parents or other siblings. But Davis said that she suspects there are some survival advantages to the group living arrangement and plans to address that subject in a future paper.</p>
<p>"Determining the fitness consequences of kin-based social groups in this species will be an important next step," Sinervo said.</p>
<p>For now, Davis said she hopes that her study will broaden the appreciation of these unusual animals among scientists and the general public. "Anyone interested in animal social behaviors will be interested in this species," she said.</p>
<p>In addition to Davis and Sinervo, the coauthors of the paper include Ammon Corl of UC Santa Cruz and Yann Surget-Groba of Bangor University and the University of Geneva, Switzerland. The study was funded by a grant from the American Museum of Natural History; awards from the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists and from the U.S. Department of Education; and an NSF postdoctoral fellowship in biology.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8325c8cc807270460167a209a50e0ff7"><name>online-health-support</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC to offer healthy lifestyle support online</title><summary>Starting October 4, all UCSC staff and faculty--and their families--can enroll in the online health and wellness Alive! program at no charge. </summary><keywords>Alive!</keywords><start-date>1286352000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC to offer healthy lifestyle support online</display-name><path>/2010/10/online-health-support</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/10/online-health-support</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1286395512888</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenm</last-modified-by><last-modified>1286395622202</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Principal editor</title><phone>(831) 459-5312</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Starting October 4, all UCSC staff and faculty--and their families--can enroll in the online Alive! program at no charge.

Participants showed statistically significant improvements in all key outcomes: minutes of moderate physical activity, increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, and decreased consumption of saturated and trans fats. Alive! has now been enhanced, including a trial for people over 50 sponsored by the National Institute on Aging to develop a means to help people improve their habits <em>before</em> they become ill.</p>
<p>UC Berkeley professor Emerita Gladys Block is the driving force behind Alive!. Block has been a pivotal figure in demonstrating the serious impact of diet on disease. Her paper on fruits and vegetables became the basis of the National Cancer Institute's well-known Five a Day program, and of many other efforts to help change America's eating habits. Dr. Block says, "I've also done extensive research on what Americans <em>aren't</em> eating, as well as their not-so-good physical activity. By now, most of us know what we should do--we just aren't doing it! Realizing that, I and my small business, NutritionQuest, developed this email-delivered program that recognizes our barriers and helps us move along in spite of them. I'm excited that the latest version will be tried out by UC staff and faculty around the state.</p>
<p>"I especially hope that those 50 or over will help perfect the system by joining the trial. Some will be asked to test out enhancements like print and automated phone coaching, developed with leading health behavior experts at Kaiser Permanente, Stanford, and Brown."</p>
<p>Participation starts October 4 at UCSC and four other UC campuses, with enrollment open through October and early November.</p>

The event is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Titled "Boiling Cold, Freezing Hot," the demonstration is presented in celebration of National Chemistry Week. It promises plenty of action, explosions, and spectacular displays of matter undergoing striking changes. The production is designed to promote interest in chemistry among students and the general public alike.&#160;</p>
<p>"I expect kids in middle school and older who are interested in science will really enjoy this show," said Roger Linington, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry, who helped organize the event.</p>
<p>Donald Showalter (a.k.a. "Dr. Wow") and Marvin Lang star together in the production. Both have presented similar programs on TV shows and at museums and universities around the world, earning many awards for their success in communicating chemistry to the public.</p>
<p>Lang, a professor emeritus of chemistry at the University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point, served on the university's Academy of Letters and Science and received the academy's Distinguished Achievement Award in 1993. He has presented chemical education programs to the public at Disneyland in Anaheim, Epcot Center in Orlando, and the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Showalter, also a professor emeritus of chemistry at the University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point, was awarded the university's Outstanding Teaching Award twice. In 2005, he was named winner of the Tom Hayes Memorial Award for Excellence in Teacher Education. He appeared in the PBS series <em>The World of Chemistry</em> from 1987 to 1989, and he has performed chemistry demonstrations for audiences at Oxford University, Helsinki University, and countless locations across the United States.</p>
<p>The event is sponsored by the Santa Clara Valley Section of the American Chemical Society. It is hosted by the UCSC Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and the UCSC student chapter of the American Chemical Society.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text>Early on in her irreverent on-stage interview with Netflix founder and CEO Reed Hastings, journalist Sarah Lacy ribbed him about running a high-tech company that depends on two famously old-guard establishments. <br/>
<br/>
"You're lodged between two stodgy systems: Hollywood and the postal service," she said with mock incredulity. "You are taking DVDs and sending them in the mail. Is that an innovative company?"<br/>
<br/>
The answer, of course, is a deafening "yes." Netflix, a video streaming company, most famous for its flat-rate rent-by-mail DVD service, helped hasten the collapse of archrival Blockbuster, and has reportedly sent out a billion DVD rentals to customers.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking to a crowd of 400 people in downtown Santa Cruz's historic Del Mar Theatre Tuesday evening, Hastings shared success tales and early horror stories from his 13 years helming a business that burned through venture capital, survived near-bankruptcy, and now boasts 15 million subscribers.<br/>
<br/>
The talk, billed as a "Fireside Chat," was part of the What's Next lecture series, co-sponsored by UC Santa Cruz, NextSpace, and the City of Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
The What&#8217;s Next Lecture Series aims to take a provocative look at innovation from business, policy, and social change angles, providing inspiration, insight, and the necessary tools for success in the coming years.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking with a calm and casual authority--and seemingly unruffled by any of Lacy's teasing questions--Hastings spoke of a company whose rise seemed to take everyone, even the founders, by surprise.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the night, Reed talked about elements that helped Netflix prevail: luck and "maniacal determination," long-range focus and flexibility, and an ability to distinguish real threats from "paranoid" delusions that can make some CEOs veer their companies off track. <br/>
<br/>
"When we started Netflix in 1997, there was a tremendous risk of no one getting a DVD player," Hastings said. "It was an exotic, expensive, unusual format. For the first couple of years, the big challenge was, 'Can we find anyone who has a DVD player.'"<br/>
<br/>
He openly admitted that the company, in the early years, had "gone through hell, almost went bankrupt, and had gone through all the competitive battles."<br/>
<br/>
Hastings said that the general public should never underestimate the power of desperation. "We had to make it work or we were dead," he said. <br/>
<br/>
When the company started, the founders vowed to convert half the business from DVDs to movies being streamed and rented over the Internet within five years. But half a decade later, in 2002--the first year that the company was "cash flow positive"--the percentage remained at zero. The same held true in 2007.<br/>
<br/>
But soon afterward, web streaming and net delivery finally came into its own, going from "nothing" to "explosion." <br/>
<br/>
"We were fortunate to be in the right place at the right time when the tidal wave hit," Hasting said. <br/>
<br/>
He also spoke of the way the company made decisions, choosing a combination of long-range vision and flexibility over knee-jerk reactivity and "paranoia."<br/>
<br/>
"You are constantly remembering that the world can change on a dime," he said. But being paranoid does not help a developing company. "Remember, the paranoid are delusional. The key is to be more like a chess player. Good chess players prune [their potential moves]. There are only a very limited number of scenarios. If you don't prune properly you get checkmated."<br/>
<br/>
This pruning strategy helped the company overtake Blockbuster, which simply did not pick up on the threat that Netflix would pose, Hastings said.<br/>
<br/>
Though he conceded that Blockbuster's stores are well-run, he said the chain was so preoccupied with the threat of videos on demand in the late 1990s that they failed to look at the bigger picture. "They looked at DVDs by mail and said, 'That's not a threat.' They pruned the tree in the wrong way and they ignored it even when we went public."<br/>
<br/>
Circumstance, and not just strategy, helped them take on Blockbuster, Hastings said.<br/>
<br/>
"We got lucky that they didn't take it seriously for a long time," he quickly added. <br/>
<br/>
The company is gradually devoting more of its resources to web streaming. Lacy asked whether such a practice would "cannibalize" the DVD-renting portion of the company and if he was "knowingly eviscerating" the subscription service.<br/>
<br/>
Hastings responded that the company always wanted to "become" Netflix--a purely web-streaming company, but used DVDs as a tool to increase its presence and publicize its large selection.<br/>
<br/>
"We are just replacing the delivery mechanism and keeping the business intact. We knew this was coming," he said. <br/>
<br/>
The downside of DVD renting is the "tremendous" postal costs. Streaming movies will reduce the company's costs from $1 for each DVD rental to less than a nickel for streaming.<br/>
<br/>
UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal, in his opening remarks, spoke of technology's importance to future jobs in Santa Cruz County, and UCSC's strong role in creating those jobs. He mentioned the talented workforce that already lives here, along with the tech- and business-minded professors and students on campus.<br/>
<br/>
"If we can harvest their skills and allow them to live and work here, that will be a tremendous achievement for the community," Blumenthal said. <br/>
<br/>
He mentioned UCSC's new computer game design program, and two UCSC alumni who are players in the high tech world--Cruzio founder and CEO Peggy Dolgenos, and Sol Lipman, founder of Rally Up, recently acquired by AOL.<br/>
<br/>
"I think the future is bright," Blumenthal said. "Maybe we'll be the origin of the next version of Facebook."</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://whatsnextlectures.com/</url><title>What's Next lectures</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8905474f807270460167a2096bc3effe"><name>bike-to-work-UCSC</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Bike to Work commuters climb to the top at UCSC</title><summary>The annual Bike to Work celebration drew an enthusiastic crowd of students, staff and faculty to campus on Thursday.</summary><start-date>1286438400000</start-date><display-name>Bike to Work commuters climb to the top at UCSC</display-name><path>/2010/10/bike-to-work-UCSC</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/10/bike-to-work-UCSC</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1286494045922</created-on><last-modified-by>nespatel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1319224122341</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title>Associate editor</title><phone>(831) 459-4834</phone><email>dwhite1@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/bike2work2010fun300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/bike2work2010fun300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bike2work2010fun300.jpg</name><display-name>bike2work2010fun300.jpg</display-name><file-size>64777</file-size><width>300</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/biketoworkthumbnailpic.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/biketoworkthumbnailpic.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>biketoworkthumbnailpic.jpg</name><display-name>biketoworkthumbnailpic.jpg</display-name><file-size>20321</file-size><width>80</width><height>82</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>UCSC students Darrow Feldstein, Kevin Condon and Molly Austin celebrated Bike To Work day on Thursday. (photo by Dan White)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz students, staff and faculty braved the big, sweaty hill leading up to campus, and rewarded themselves with free breakfasts, during the annual Bike To Work Day, an eco-friendly event that sent more than 6,000 commuters into the streets of Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>The Thursday-morning bike celebration drew such a good crowd to various breakfast sites on campus that at least one of them&#160; &#8211; the breakfast spot at the campus Women&#8217;s Center &#8211; started running out of certain food items earlier than expected.</p>
<p>Molly Austin, 21 (College 10, sociology), was working the event for the first time. She freely admits that bike awareness came to her gradually, after being car-dependent for years. "I used to insist on driving to high school even though I lived three blocks away,&#8217;&#8217; she said.</p>
<p>It took a group of bike-oriented friends to make the difference, she said. "It was a 180-degree change," Austin said.</p>
<p>Austin handed out apples, energy bars, and cups of juice to an energetic group of riders including Kevin Condon, 21 (Stevenson, environmental science/economics), who just so happens to be president of another group celebrating self-powered transportation &#8211; the UCSC Kayak Club.</p>
<p>Condon, who lives off campus, said he gets so much satisfaction from riding a bike that he thinks of it as a lifestyle choice more than an ideological one. Yes, he has to fight his way up that infamous hill, &#8220;but when I&#8217;m done with class I get to go down that hill. I see the whole bay, I put my hands up, and I&#8217;ve earned that view.

<p>"The Hill" was a topic that came up frequently at the Women&#8217;s Center breakfast stop-over. But the riders also pointed out that bike commuters can also take advantage of a bike-friendly shuttle that will do the heavy lifting for those who can't make it to the top.</p>

<p>For more than two decades, Liu has been working with a team of doctors and engineers to develop a retinal implant that can restore vision to people who have gone blind from degenerative retinal diseases, such as macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa. He designed the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2008/06/2301.html">microchip</a> that is at the heart of the artificial retina, which is now being tested in clinical trials.</p>
<p>Liu has been involved in the project since its inception. He and his collaborators are continuing to work on improved models of the retinal implant. Other members of the team honored by <em>Popular Mechanics</em> for their work on the project include Mark Humayun and James Weiland of the Doheney Eye Institute; Satinderpall Pannu of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Armand Tanguay of the University of Southern California; Yu-Chong Tai of the California Institute of Technology; Kurt Wessendorf of Sandia National Laboratory; and Robert Greenberg of Second Sight Medical Products.</p>
<p>At an awards ceremony in New York City on October 5, Liu took part in a panel discussion with three other scientists involved in the Artificial Retina Project and one patient who has an artificial retina implant (see <em>Popular Mechanics</em> <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/breakthroughs/blindness-panel-breakthrough-medicine">news story</a>).</p>

<p>Since the 1960s, when the national disability rights movement was launched by a handful of brave individuals, our society has been transformed in profound and positive ways. Access and equal rights for the disabled have been codified into law. Landmark legislation, including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, has removed physical barriers and helped erode symbolic obstacles, as well.</p>
<p>Over the years, society's awareness of disability has grown to include so-called "invisible disabilities," such as learning disabilities. At UC Santa Cruz, the <a href="http://drc.ucsc.edu">Disability Resource Center</a> provides free services and support to the nearly 600 registered students with disabilities, while the student-run <a href="http://ucscdisabilityalliance.com">Disability Alliance</a> is an advocacy organization focused on improving the experiences of all disabled students on campus. Faculty and staff with disability-related needs should contact their supervisor, but can also call Kelly Roberts, disability management coordinator, at 459-4602 for assistance. Requests for disability-related facility improvements, such as curb cuts or power-assist doors, can be directed to Susan Willats at 459-3759.</p>
<p>Despite all the progress, there is more work to do. We remain committed to continuing to improve access at UCSC, and we welcome your input.

October is National Cyber Security Awareness Month. This week's cyber security "Tip of the Week" from ITS focuses on <strong>eliminating unnecessary stored information.</strong></p>
<p>From a security perspective, the best way to protect information is not to have it in the first place. Beyond security, storing old records takes up space, makes current information more difficult to find, and even subjects the university to the potential burden of having to produce those records in response to information requests and lawsuits.&#160;
</p>
<p>For all of these reasons, it is a good idea to take the time to remind yourself what you have stored on your computer and to delete what you no longer need. Remember to shred or securely delete anything sensitive. Candidates for deletion include:</p>
<p>&#8226; Drafts and old versions</p>
<p>&#8226; Extra copies of files</p>
<p>&#8226; Old emails and attachments</p>
<p>&#8226; Anything that you no longer need for which you're not the office of record</p>
<p>&#8226; Anything with Social Security number (SSN), if there isn't a legitimate business need for its retention. If you have to store SSNs, be sure they are properly protected. Contact ITS if you require assistance (contact info below).</p>
<p>For questions or assistance, contact the ITS Support Center: <span><a href="http://itrequest.ucsc.edu/">itrequest.ucsc.edu</a>,</span> <a href="mailto:help@ucsc.edu">help@ucsc.edu</a>, 459-HELP, 54 Kerr Hall.</p>

The Legislature has approved a budget bill that is now being considered by Gov. Schwarzenegger.</p>
<p>Legislators have agreed to restore nearly $200 million in permanent state funding for the university, to direct $106 million in one-time federal stimulus funds to the UC system, and to pay a portion of the cost of UC's many "unfunded students," including hundreds of students we enrolled at UC Santa Cruz despite the state's decision to provide only partial funding. Although we have a long way to go to make up for the cuts of the past three years, it is encouraging to see lawmakers willing to reinvest in the university.</p>
<p>It is a particular pleasure to share news of these developments one day after a national day of action in support of public education. At UCSC yesterday, advocates for higher education gathered for a noon rally in Quarry Plaza; Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway was among those who attended.</p>
<p>I am confident that UC fared better in this year's budget negotiations thanks in large part to the work of thousands of committed UC students, alumni, faculty, staff, and friends who spoke out on behalf of the university. As I told a group of UCSC student reporters yesterday, it is a pleasure to see positive results come from that concerted effort.</p>
As we await the governor's final decision, it would be premature to speculate about how additional funds might be distributed to campuses. CP/EVC Galloway and I will keep you informed as we learn more.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8dce7320807270460167a20905f5cdb4"><name>career-fair-brief</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Career fairs open doors for students</title><summary>The Career Center has scheduled two upcoming fall events that will help students think about life beyond UC Santa Cruz. &#13;

In addition to faculty research presentations, the event will include plenary talks by experts in the three focus areas and a graduate student poster session. The event is free, but advance registration at <a href="http://rr.soe.ucsc.edu/">rr.soe.ucsc.edu</a> is required.</p>
<p>"This event gives our colleagues and industry partners in Silicon Valley an opportunity to learn about groundbreaking research by our faculty and students, who are addressing a wide variety of problems in areas that are critical for business, the environment, and humanity," said Art Ramirez, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>Jonathan Trent, a bioengineer at NASA Ames Research Center and adjunct professor of biomolecular engineering at UCSC, will give a plenary talk on energy, focusing on promising developments in sustainable energy technologies, including his work on the OMEGA Project at NASA. OMEGA (Offshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae) is a system for growing algae to produce biofuel and other products. In his talk, "Beyond Petroleum: The OMEGA revolution," Trent will discuss the need to cultivate sustainable, carbon-neutral energy crops.</p>
<p>David Yager, dean of the Division of Arts at UCSC, will give a plenary talk on human-centered design. Yager's work, which focuses on the relationships between art and science, includes a collaboration with researchers in the Department of Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes for the advancement of new knowledge, products, and processes in health care. His talk, "User Centric or Me Centric Design/Crowdsourcing," will emphasize the idea that "good design is better than good-looking design."</p>
<p>A plenary talk on biotechnology features William Young, a partner at Clarus Ventures who has extensive experience in the biotechnology industry. In his talk, "Genentech Biotech Manufacturing: Lessons from the early years," Young will discuss how Genentech became the premier company in the world in biotech process development and manufacturing, and how that made life-saving drugs available to patients.</p>
<p>A broad range of faculty presentations will take place throughout the day. Speakers include Phil Berman, professor of biomolecular engineering, who will discuss his work on AIDS vaccines; Ed Green, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering, who will talk about the Neanderthal genome and what it can tell us about recent human evolution; Joel Kubby, associate professor of electrical engineering, who will review the development of a renewable-energy microgrid at NASA Ames; Sri Kurniawan, assistant professor of computer engineering, who will discuss human-centered assistive technology; and David Draper, professor of applied mathematics and statistics, who will describe how electronic medical-records systems can enable early detection of adverse medical events.</p>
<p>All presentations will be held in the Engineering 2 building on the UCSC campus.

George Brown, professor emeritus of physics, and Donald Wiberg, professor emeritus of electrical engineering, were each awarded Edward A. Dickson Emeriti Professorships in recognition of their outstanding achievements in scholarship and teaching.</p>
<p>Brown, who served as UCSC's vice provost for academic affairs from 2000 to 2005, received two Excellence in Teaching Awards as a professor of physics. He has been recalled from retirement to update, refine, and teach in the undergraduate laboratory program for the Department of Physics, which he chaired from 1996 to 2000. He has also recently served as an advisor to the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems. He received his Ph.D. in physics from Cornell University, was a researcher at Bell Laboratories in the 1970s, and served on the applied physics faculty at Stanford University before joining the UCSC faculty in 1990. He was elected a fellow of the American Physical Society in 1985.</p>
<p>Wiberg retired in 1994 from UCLA where he was a professor of engineering and applied science, as well as a professor of anesthesiology. In 2000, he came to UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering, where he does research and teaching in the Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering. He is also affiliated with the Center for Adaptive Optics. A Life Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Wiberg served as an IEEE Congressional Fellow to U.S. Senator Tom Harkin in 1995.</p>
<p>Dickson Emeritus Professorship Awards are awarded annually and funded by an endowment from the estate of former UC Regent Edward A. Dickson. The professorships make it possible for the university to retain the invaluable services of highly accomplished, retired faculty members for the benefit of its students.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9c3d49ad807270460167a209cd38de40"><name>research-funding</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC research funding hit record levels in 2009-10</title><summary>UCSC researchers attracted a record $148 million in external grants and contracts to the campus in the 2009-10 fiscal year.</summary><keywords>Bruce Margon, research funding, grants and contracts</keywords><start-date>1286784000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC research funding hit record levels in 2009-10</display-name><path>/2010/10/research-funding</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/10/research-funding</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1286816483666</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1286816563736</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz researchers attracted a record $148 million in external grants and contracts to the campus in the 2009-10 fiscal year. This represents a 22 percent increase over the previous year and a 12 percent increase over the previous record high of $132 million in 2007-08.</p>
<p>UCSC's continued success in attracting research funding has brought in more than $1 billion over the past ten years, said Bruce Margon, vice chancellor for research.</p>
<p>"This funding supports the research programs that keep our faculty at the forefront of their fields, and it also creates direct and unique opportunities for our students, who are able to work on exciting research projects and learn from faculty who bring the thrill of discovery into the classroom," Margon said. "This shattering of the record is due to the tremendous talent, efforts, and successes of the UCSC faculty and the staff who work with them."</p>
<p>Of the total for 2009-10, $33 million came from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), the federal economic stimulus program. According to Margon, however, it is hard to tell how many of the ARRA awards would have been awarded even without the stimulus program. "There is no easy way to judge the precise impact of ARRA, but it was certainly positive," he said. "And it is likely that the award totals for us and other U.S. research universities will dip at least slightly next year as the ARRA expires."</p>
A detailed breakdown of the 2009-10 awards is not yet available. As in past years, the largest funding sources for UCSC research were NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9ca4a8ae807270460167a20913f698fc"><name>national-coming-out-day</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>National Coming Out Day</title><summary>We open this message on a celebratory and supportive note for National Coming Out Day, October 11, while acknowledging somber news across our country regarding the tragic suicides of gay youth and youth who were perceived to be gay by their harassers.</summary><start-date>1286784000000</start-date><display-name>National Coming Out Day</display-name><path>/2010/10/national-coming-out-day</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/10/national-coming-out-day</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1286823257949</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1286823257949</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>We open this message on a celebratory and supportive note for <a href="http://www.hrc.org/issues/3338.htm?utm_source=hrc.org&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=NCOD">National Coming Out Day</a>, October 11, while acknowledging somber news across our country regarding the tragic suicides of gay youth and youth who were perceived to be gay by their harassers. 

<p class="Default">These tragedies affect not only the student community, not only the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (GLBTI) community and their allies, but our entire campus community. The recent arrival of new students on our campus serves as a reminder that some of our students have chosen, or will choose, to come out for the first time during their college experience, believing that this is a safe environment in which to do so. As your campus diversity officers, we share responsibility with others for providing such an environment, and we invite your input on how we are doing (<a href="mailto:diversity@ucsc.edu">diversity@ucsc.edu</a>).</p>
<p class="Default">&#160;</p>
<p class="Default">The fact that the deaths of Justin Aaberg, Asher Brown, Raymond Chase, Tyler Clementi, Billy Lucas and Seth Walsh were linked to peer harassment and bullying calls us to stand up strongly against such discriminatory and hurtful behavior. If you believe you have witnessed or that you have been a target of a hate or bias-motivated incident on campus or while participating in a university-sponsored activity, we urge you to report the incident (anonymously, if you wish). Resources include the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/judicial/hate-bias.shtml">Student Judicial Affairs Office</a> for student-related matters and Campus Diversity Officer Ashish Sahni (<a href="mailto:ashish@ucsc.edu">ashish@ucsc.edu</a>) for staff- and faculty-related matters. The campus also offers <a href="https://www.sa.ucsc.edu/judicial/incident.cfm">Hate/Bias-Motivated Incident Reporting Form</a><span>s</span>. Every report receives immediate attention and is taken very seriously; appropriate action is taken. Hate and bias-motivated incidents will not be tolerated, whether the incidents are student, staff, or faculty-related or involve campus guests.</p>

<p>UCSC was recently ranked highly as an LGBT-friendly campus, receiving five out of five stars, from the <a href="http://www.campusclimateindex.org/about/default.aspx">Campus Pride Index</a> (click <a href="http://www.campusclimateindex.org/details/premium.aspx?ID=252">here</a> for details of UCSC&#8217;s rating). We take pride in this recognition as we remind everyone to remain vigilant in our efforts to create a campus climate that is inclusive, respectful, and welcoming to all. As we celebrate this achievement, we must be mindful that we are not immune to hate/bias incidents and bullying. During the last year, student-on-student and staff-on-staff sexual orientation based hate/bias incidents were addressed on our campus.</p>

<p>What are we doing? The following are a few of the collaborative efforts we have initiated:</p>

<ul>
<li>As campus diversity officers, we will be holding regular dialogues with students during this academic year. The first dialogue will be at Cowell College on Tuesday, October 19, from 6-7:30 p.m. in the Cowell Apartment Community Room. Food will be provided. We encourage all students to come share their thoughts and ideas on how we can continue to promote a climate of inclusion on campus.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://diversity.ucsc.edu/diversity.htm">UCSC Advisory Council on Campus Climate, Culture, and Inclusion</a> addresses efforts to cultivate and maintain an inclusive, civil environment.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://diversity.ucsc.edu/">Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</a> has included a course on LGBT issues in the workplace in our new <a href="http://diversity.ucsc.edu/training.htm#divinclusion">Diversity and Inclusion Certificate Program</a> for staff.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, there is more work to do. Are we all doing everything possible to promote a healthy climate on our campus? What specific actions can be taken towards this end? Campus climate cannot depend on the actions of one office or one group but requires the efforts and commitments of all campus members. UCSC students, faculty and staff need to proactively dialogue and act to create a campus community that reflects our <a href="http://www1.ucsc.edu/about/principles_community.asp">Principles of Community</a>. We need to continue to strive to be diverse, open, purposeful, caring, just, disciplined, and celebrative. To facilitate such dialogue and actions, we will work closely with the <a href="http://www.queer.ucsc.edu/">Lionel Cant&#250; GLBTI Resource Center</a> to develop and coordinate opportunities for us to engage as a community. Please see below for details regarding a vigil that the Cant&#250; Center has organized.</p>

<p>In closing, we want to welcome our new and returning GLBTI students, faculty, and staff as vital and valued members of our campus community. National Coming Out Day represents pride, courage and self-respect. We can all learn from and should aspire to practice such values.</p>

<p>Their study, published in the October 7 issue of <em>Nature</em>, describes neural circuits in the retina at the resolution of individual neurons and provides insight into the neural code used by the retina to relay color information to the brain.</p>
<p>"Our neural recording system is able to record simultaneously the tiny electrical signals generated by hundreds of the retinal output neurons that transmit information about the outside visual world to the brain," said coauthor Alan Litke, adjunct professor of physics at UCSC.</p>
<p>Litke and coauthor Alexander Sher, assistant professor of physics, lead the work at UCSC on the project, which involves a large team of collaborators, including biologists at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.</p>
<p>"Nobody has ever seen the entire input-output transformation performed by complete circuits in the retina at single-cell resolution," said senior author E. J. Chichilnisky of the Salk Institute. "We think these data will allow us to more deeply understand neuronal computations in the visual system and ultimately may help us construct better retinal implants."</p>
<p>The retinal readout device that made the experiments possible was inspired by detector technologies that physicists are using to search for the <a href="http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/cms/?pid=1000368">Higgs boson</a> at the <a href="http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/lhc/lhc-en.html">Large Hadron Collider</a>. It was developed by an international team of high-energy physicists from the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) at UCSC, the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow, Poland, and the University of&#160; Glasgow, U.K. The system records neural signals at high speed (over ten million samples each second) and with fine spatial detail, sufficient to detect even a locally complete population of the tiny and densely spaced output cells known as "midget" retinal ganglion cells.</p>
<p>Retinal ganglion cells are classified based on their size, the connections they form, and their responses to visual stimulation, which can vary widely. Despite their differences, they all have one thing in common--a long axon that extends into the brain and forms part of the optic nerve.</p>
<p>Visual processing begins when photons entering the eye strike one or more of the 125 million light-sensitive nerve cells in the retina. This first layer of cells, which are known as rods and cones, converts the information into electrical signals and sends them to an intermediate layer, which in turn relays signals to the 20 or so distinct types of retinal ganglion cells.</p>
<p>In an earlier study, the researchers found that each type of retinal ganglion cell forms a seamless lattice covering visual space that transmits a complete visual image to the brain. In the current study--led by Sher and Salk postdoctoral researchers Greg Field and Jeffrey Gauthier--the team zoomed in on the pattern of connectivity between these layers of retinal ganglion cells and the full lattice of cone receptors.</p>
<p>To resolve the fine structure of receptive fields--the small, irregularly shaped windows through which neurons in the retina view the world--the authors used stimuli with tenfold smaller pixels. "Instead of a diffuse region of light sensitivity, we detected punctate islands of light sensitivity separated by regions of no light sensitivity," Field said.</p>
<p>When combined with information on spectral sensitivities of individual cones, maps of these punctate islands not only allowed the researchers to recreate the full cone mosaic found in the retina, but also to conclude which cone fed information to which retinal ganglion cell.</p>
<p>"Just by stimulating input cells and taking a high density recording from output cells, we can identify all individual input and output cells and find out who is connected to whom," Chichilnisky said.</p>
<p>At UCSC, researchers have created several versions of the neural recording system, including advanced versions that are able to both stimulate and record neural activity in a large population of neurons. Sher, Litke, and their collaborators are using the devices to investigate fundamental questions in neuroscience. For example, they are studying retinal development to understand how the retinal circuitry gets "wired up" with such complex and precise connections, and they are investigating fundamental circuits in the brain and how they process information. The UCSC research also has biomedical applications, such as guiding the design of future retinal prosthetic devices and devising improved treatments for retinal diseases.</p>
<p>Coauthors of the <em>Nature</em> paper, in addition to Chichilnisky, Field, Gauthier, Sher, and Litke, include Martin Greschner, Timothy Machado, Lauren Jepson, and Jonathon Shlens in the Systems Neurobiology Laboratory at the Salk Institute; Deborah Gunning and Keith Mathieson at the University of Glasgow; Wladyslaw Dabrowski at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow; and Liam Paninski at Columbia University, New York.</p>

<p>The University of California is about to announce the health&#160;insurance open enrollment period for 2011. I am writing in advance&#160;of that to encourage you to familiarize yourself with new plan&#160;alternatives, changes to existing plans, and the full range of&#160;options that may be available to you and your family during the&#160;upcoming open enrollment period.</p>
<p>This is especially important for UC Santa Cruz academic and staff personnel, as there are significant changes to the Health Net plan that historically has been the desired option for a high percentage of UCSC employees. I urge you to take time to review the <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/memo_10-11-10.htm">overview</a> of plan changes and options that has been prepared by Staff Human Resources and Academic Personnel Office. This will be updated and expanded as new information becomes available.</p>
<p>I understand that many of you may face difficult choices as you evaluate health plan options, benefits and costs and determine the best options for you and your dependents. Please know that campus staff are working hard to be prepared to assist you in making these decisions. Over the next several weeks, the campus Benefits Office will offer general and department-specific workshops and other programs to help inform your decision making.</p>

Nature Returns. Cibachrome<br/></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong>Ansel Adams</strong>, <strong>Diane Arbus</strong>, <strong>Vito Acconci</strong>, <strong>Robert Rauschenberg</strong>&#8230;these are just a few of the extraordinary artists that will be featured in <em>Human Conditions</em>, a new exhibition running through November 20 at UCSC&#8217;s Sesnon Gallery.<br/>
<br/>
The show is a provocative selection of famous photographs and prints, curated by Sesnon director Shelby Graham, that reveal the multifaceted levels of the human experience--from curious observations of daily life, to disturbing images of exploitation.&#160;&#160;<br/>
<br/>
The exhibition is drawn from the private collection of Arts Division dean David Yager and his wife Stacey.<br/>
<br/>
Along with guests Richard Polsky--art dealer and author of <em>I Sold Andy Warhol (Too Soon</em>)--and San Francisco gallery owner Catharine Clark, the dean will participate in a lively panel discussion on collecting art, immediately following the exhibition&#8217;s opening reception on October 19, which begins at 5 p.m.</p>
<p>&#8220;Collecting is a commitment to art and passion&#8212;and to living with art which I think is a wonderful thing,&#8221; Yager noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not only about buying art, but also about connecting with the artists. It&#8217;s more like going to open studios than going to a gallery--it&#8217;s that personal connection with the artist.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;A lot of the works in the exhibition I didn&#8217;t purchase--I traded with the artists, or they were gifts, or I obtained them a long time ago,&#8221; Yager added. &#8220;Almost all the prints have a story--either how I came upon them, or from contact with the artist.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Curator Graham noted that the exhibition provides a rare opportunity for students to encounter gelatin silver prints, photogravures. lithographs, etchings and mixed media work from some of the most creative artists of the 20th century.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;You&#8217;ll see a few surprises in the show,&#8221; said Graham, &#8220;such as a landscape by Ansel Adams on a commercial coffee can.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;And Vito Acconci--well known for video and performance art in the 1960s--has some stunning photo lithographs depicting suffering from the atomic bomb,&#8221; she added.<br/>
<br/>
Also included will be photographs from Rauschenberg&#8217;s <em>Studies for Chinese Summerhall series</em>, taken in China in 1982.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Most people know Robert Rauschenberg for his photographic montages,&#8221; said Graham. &#8220;But before he made his final collage (the 100-foot long photograph <em>Chinese Summerhall</em>), he decided to make editions of individual photographs; there are two in this exhibition.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
An additional panel related to the exhibition will take place at 6 p.m. on November 10 at the new UCSC Digital Arts Research Center (DARC) in room 308. Dean Yager will join UCSC arts faculty Norman Locks and Paul Rangell, plus longtime Cabrillo College instructor Jane Gregorius, for a discussion about the artistic process of image making and collaborations with limited edition prints.<br/>
<br/>
The complete list of artists in the Sesnon exhibition: <strong>Ansel Adams, Vito Acconci, Diane Arbus, Thomas Barrow, Harry Callahan, Chuck Close, Jim Dine, Fred Endsley, Robert Fichter, Robert Heinecken, Robert Mapplethorpe, Barbara Morgan, Robert Rauschenberg, James Rosenquist, Miriam Shapiro, Kara Walker, and Joel Peter Witkin</strong>.</p>

 &#160;<br/>
 I am pleased to share with you the University of California's benefits plans and rates for 2011. The Open Enrollment period begins October 25 at 8 a.m. and runs to 5 p.m. on November 23.<br/>
<br/>
 In California and across the country, employer-sponsored health insurance premiums have gone up again and are projected to rise significantly, well into the future. Most individuals covered by an employer's group health insurance plan will continue to see double-digit increases in their costs and contributions.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 Our key objectives for 2011 were to innovate with regard to plan design and to control costs while continuing to provide UC's faculty and staff with high-quality and high-value health and welfare benefits. The Benefits staff worked hard toward those objectives, and with this year's offerings more than 53 percent of our workforce will see increases of less than $10 per month. You can view the 2011 employee rates on the At Your Service website (<a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/employees/health_welfare/medical/medical_plan_costs_2011.html">http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/employees/health_welfare/medical/medical_plan_costs_2011.html</a>).<br/>
<br/>
 Here are some key developments for 2011.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 <strong>An Additional Health Net Option<br/>
</strong> We worked with UC's medical enterprise and Health Net to develop a new value option: UC's Health Net Blue &amp; Gold HMO. This custom network is being <em><span>offered exclusively to the University of California</span></em>, in addition to the standard Health Net HMO. The Blue &amp; Gold HMO network provides the same excellent coverage as our standard Health Net HMO, but uses Health Net&#8217;s most efficient providers as a way to lower premium costs for University of California employees and their covered dependents.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 Again, the standard Health Net HMO is still available, but those who elect the UC/Health Net Blue &amp; Gold HMO custom network can take advantage of physicians and hospitals at lower employee costs. The new plan's network includes 13 of our 20 largest provider groups, including the UC medical centers and medical groups. In all, health care providers for more than 60 percent of our current Health Net members are in the Health Net Blue &amp; Gold HMO network.<br/>
<br/>
 If Health Net's style of HMO fit your needs in prior years, it would be prudent to take a look at the new Health Net Blue &amp; Gold HMO to see if it's right for you and your family.<br/>
<br/>
 The list of medical groups participating in the Health Net Blue &amp; Gold network is available here (<span><span><a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/docs/uc_healthnet_blue-gold-provider-list_1010.pdf">http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/docs/uc_healthnet_blue-gold-provider-list_1010.pdf</a></span></span>) and the complete list of providers will be posted on the Health Net website<br/>
 (<a href="http://www.healthnet.com/uc">http://www.healthnet.com/uc</a>) beginning October 15.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>A New Anthem Plan<br/>
</strong> We are also replacing the CIGNA Choice Fund plan with the Anthem Lumenos PPO with Health Reimbursement Account (HRA). CIGNA's employee premiums had become quite expensive, so with modest plan changes and a change in carrier, we are able to offer this style of plan at a much lower price.<br/>
<br/>
 Anthem Lumenos is designed for employees who are willing to take a more active role in managing their health care costs and usage. However, this plan also has the potential for high out-of-pocket expenses, so it may not be for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Health Care Reform<br/>
</strong> As a result of health care reform legislation enacted earlier this year, you will see changes in medical benefits, including preventive services at no charge and the elimination of lifetime limits on medical coverage.<br/>
<br/>
 In addition, faculty and staff will be able to enroll their adult children, up to age 26, in their UC medical plan. We have added extra value for employees by going further than federal health care reform legislation and expanding coverage of children up to age 26 to include dental, vision, legal, life and accidental death and dismemberment (AD&amp;D) insurance.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Looking Forward<br/>
</strong> Great benefits are a key component of UC's overall approach to recruitment and retention of outstanding faculty and staff. The health and wellness of our people and their families will help UC continue its excellence. It would be challenging to find another employer-sponsored benefits package of higher quality and value. Our planning for 2012 will begin shortly, and you will see an increased commitment to innovation in plan design, employee wellness and high-value offerings in the years to come.<br/>
<br/>
 I wish you all the best as you evaluate your choices from this fine set of benefits programs when the Open Enrollment begins on October 25.<br/>
<br/>

Beck's talk, "Oil, Oyster Reefs, and the Gulf of Mexico," is part of the Science Sunday lecture series at the Seymour Center at Long Marine Laboratory. The event is free with paid admission or membership.</p>
<p>Beck is an expert in the conservation and restoration of oyster reefs and near-shore habitats, and he has worked on conservation in the Gulf of Mexico for over 20 years.&#160; According to Beck, "The Gulf of Mexico is one of the few places on earth where the health of the environment is so obviously linked to the health of the economy and the community on such a vast scale. Eight-five percent of the world's oyster reefs have been lost, and the remaining few are one of the most imperiled marine habitats. The oyster reefs of the Gulf are not merely the best in the nation; they are the best in the world, a global treasure. Yet, even in the Gulf, some 50 to 90 percent of the oyster reefs have been lost, and that was before BP's oil spill."</p>
<p>The <em>Deepwater Horizon</em> spill presents a new and significant threat to the Gulf of Mexico region. The full effects of the spill on the environment and the economy of the Gulf Coast remain unclear. "What it clear is that this accident will have a continued and potentially long-term impact on the region," Beck said.</p>
<p>Having just returned from the Gulf Coast, Beck will reflect on the emerging and conflicting information from the various public and private organizations studying the region. His talk will provide up-to-date information on the oil spill and efforts to restore the Gulf's habitats to enhance fisheries, water quality, coastal protection, and recreational and natural resources.</p>
<p>Located in Santa Cruz on the bluffs overlooking Monterey Bay, the Seymour Center provides exciting and engaging ocean education programs for the visiting public and for students of all ages. It is dedicated to educating youth, families, and the general public about the role science plays in the understanding and conservation of the world's oceans. The Seymour Center is open six days a week, year-round, and serves more than 58,000 people each year.</p>

But when it came to getting around the sprawling campus, students, parents, and visitors alike were often bewildered.</p>
<p>That's because most of the streets were unnamed.</p>
<p>During almost all of UCSC's 45-year history, parents got lost, new students drove around in frantic circles, and people gave incomprehensible directions.</p>
<p>Not anymore. For the first time since its creation, UC Santa Cruz now has names for all of its roads, streets, and byways.</p>
<p>This begs the question: If UCSC is only naming its streets this year, how many of them were nameless before?</p>
<p>The truth is that a whopping 70 percent of all those roads had no names at all until this spring.</p>
<p>Three years ago, Susan Willats (College Five [now Porter], theater '81), assistant director of Transportation &amp; Parking Services (TAPS), took an inventory of UCSC's roads--and discovered that most of those roads were completely anonymous. No names, no numbers, no nothing.</p>
<p>Asked about the reason for all those nameless roads, former campus architect Frank Zwart said, "My only guess--and it's pure speculation--was that no one found a need for them before now."</p>
<p>Zwart, who is recently retired, added that "UCSC was always a little bit like a medieval town. Knowing your way around was limited to the people who lived there."</p>
<p>No wonder all those people were staggering around campus with confused expressions on their faces. Dozens of intersections had no identifying signs of any kind. Stumped drivers whipped out their Blackberries and logged onto Mapquest and Google Earth, only to find that their "state-of-the-art" maps had blank spaces where names and waypoints were supposed to be.</p>
<p>To make matters even worse, online searches for various campus locations often direct visitors to "1156 High Street," the general mailing address for the campus. Never mind the fact that many UCSC landmarks are far, far away from 1156 High Street.</p>
<p>Willats worked with John Barnes, who is now currently the interim associate vice chancellor of Physical Planning and Construction, director of Transportation &amp; Parking Services Larry Pageler, and fire chief Jeff Trapp to develop a list of potential road names.</p>
<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal approved the list of names, and the changes already appear on UCSC's <a href="http://maps.ucsc.edu/">online campus map</a>.</p>
<p>UCSC has also alerted county emergency services about the changes.</p>
<p>But the campus still needs to alert the people over at Google--whose version of the UCSC map is not completely accurate, and includes none of the new names.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz's brand-new <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/iphone-app.html">iPhone app</a> utilizes Google&#8217;s map artwork. Willats is working to provide Google with the information they need, in the format they require, to correct their maps.</p>
<p>The campus also has to put up signs showing all those new names, and will replace existing signs with easier-to-read versions at the same time. This sign-building and replacement process will cost an estimated $22,000, according to Willats. She hopes the signs will be up by spring quarter 2011.</p>
<p>Willats, who also manages the online maps available at maps.ucsc.edu, added that the topography of the campus--which is built straight into the side of a mountain--added another layer of difficulty.</p>
<p>"Aside from the fact that there were so many nameless streets, the campus is densely forested," Willats said. "There is nary a straight road in the place. Everything is curvy and slope-y. It is fabulously beautiful because of that, but it makes way-finding complex."</p>
<p>The advent of road names could end a longstanding campus tradition of giving and receiving esoteric driving instructions to campus landmarks.</p>
<p>Take, for example, this actual set of directions that a UCSC student recently gave to someone trying to reach a campus destination:</p>
<p>"OK, so let's see, if you're starting out from the base of campus, take the western entrance, then head up past that first kiosk, follow it around, turn left at that second stop light, then go all the way up as far as you can go, so when you get to the tee-off, make a right, pass three colleges, and Science Hill, and then, once you get to the stop sign, it tees off again, and then you'll see the parking structure on the right, and then, at the stop sign, turn left at Northern Remote."</p>
<p>The new names could also spell doom for a second tradition--making up long, functional-but-clunky nicknames for roads that had no official names.</p>
<p>For instance, the road that is now known as "That Short, Wide Street that Leads Up to the Barn-Shaped Building Where Students Buy Parking Permits" will now be known simply as "Ox Team Road."</p>
<p>The new road names are mostly descriptive and informative, not honorific. Merrill Road is named for the college it passes, while Red Hill Road is merely the extension of an existing fire road. However, Ox Team Road is a reference to the campus's historic past as a lime-works operation.</p>
<p>The names of the new roads could be changed if members of an official campus-landmark naming committee decide to rename them after donors, Willats said, adding that the new names are "not immortal."</p>
<p>Willats has lots of experience finding her way around the place.</p>
<p>When she became in employee in 1986, she coordinated services for students with mobility impairments, including driving them around campus in a wheelchair lift-equipped van. Later she became one of the campus Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Compliance Officers, and eventually started the campus map program. Since March 2009, she has worked for TAPS.</p>
<p>Willats first came up with the idea for these wayfinding improvements 10 years ago when she was working on accessibility issues on campus.</p>
<p>"I noticed that a lot of people were getting lost, and that [mapmaking] didn't exist in anyone's job description," she said. "The only map of campus at the time was an 8-by-10-inch map that people saw at the back of the phone book."</p>
<p>She said that when people look back on the days of confusion and getting lost at UCSC, it could be a rueful, nostalgic memory, "like thinking about backpacking around Greece and being unable to read the alphabet."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="abc5afc1807270460167a2094e1b0d6b"><name>reminder-town-hall-meeting-about-post-employment-benefits</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Reminder: Town hall meeting about post employment benefits</title><summary>This is a reminder that on Monday, October 18, the campus will host two town hall meetings about proposed changes to UC's post employment benefits. </summary><start-date>1287043200000</start-date><display-name>Town hall meeting about post employment benefits reminder</display-name><path>/2010/10/reminder-town-hall-meeting-about-post-employment-benefits</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/10/reminder-town-hall-meeting-about-post-employment-benefits</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1287077080876</created-on><last-modified-by>jrburns</last-modified-by><last-modified>1287079095970</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>This is a reminder that on Monday, October 18, the campus will host two town hall meetings about proposed changes to UC's post employment benefits. The format will follow past forums on this topic: A forum for staff and faculty will take place from noon to 2 p.m., followed by a 30-minute break and then a forum for emeriti and retirees from 2:30-4 p.m. Both events will take place in the Stevenson Event Center.</p>
<p>Campus members are encouraged to submit questions in advance, and a form is available online (<a href="http://chancellor.ucsc.edu/pebquestionform.shtml">http://chancellor.ucsc.edu/pebquestionform.shtml</a>).</p>
<p>UCSC panelists will include Chancellor George Blumenthal, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway, Committee on Faculty Welfare Chair Suresh Lodha, and Staff Advisory Board Chair Don Calerdine. They will be joined by systemwide representatives, including Executive Vice President for Business Operations Nathan Brostrom, Academic Council Chair Daniel Simmons, and Pension &amp; Retirement Programs Director Gary Schlimgen. I will serve as host and moderator.</p>
<p>For those who are unable to attend, the session will be videotaped and accessible from the campus's Budget Update website (<a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/budget-update/">http://www.ucsc.edu/budget-update/</a>) following the forum.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Staff and Faculty</audience><admin> Assistant Chancellor Ashish Sahni</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ac65acaf807270460167a20906c04e3e"><name>yamashita-national-book-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> UC Santa Cruz Literature professor nominated for National Book Award</title><summary>Karen Tei Yamashita, professor of literature and co-director of the Creative Writing Program at UC Santa Cruz, has been nominated for a 2010 National Book Award.</summary><start-date>1287043200000</start-date><display-name>rofessor nominated for National Book Award</display-name><path>/2010/10/yamashita-national-book-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/10/yamashita-national-book-award</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1287087565584</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1288035848452</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/i-hotel-yamashitacover-200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/i-hotel-yamashitacover-200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>i-hotel-yamashitacover-200.jpg</name><display-name>i-hotel-yamashitacover-200.jpg</display-name><file-size>45675</file-size><width>200</width><height>301</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/yamashita-thumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/yamashita-thumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>yamashita-thumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>yamashita-thumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>19114</file-size><width>81</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/yamashita-200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/yamashita-200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>yamashita-200.jpg</name><display-name>yamashita-200.jpg</display-name><file-size>33169</file-size><width>200</width><height>245</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>&#160;Karen Tei Yamashita</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Karen Tei Yamashita, professor of literature and co-director of the Creative Writing Program at UC Santa Cruz, has been nominated for a 2010 National Book Award.</p>

Costa.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Oceanographers are using data collected by elephant seals to improve their map of the seafloor on Antarctica's continental shelf. The new map results from a collaboration between Daniel Costa, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, who has been studying southern elephant seals in the region, and oceanographer Laurie Padman of Earth &amp; Space Research in Corvallis, Oregon.</p>
<p>Between 2005 and 2009, Costa tagged 57 southern elephant seals with satellite transmitters as part of a habitat ecology study. "We were interested in the animals--where they went and what they did," he said.</p>
<p>When the Wilkins Ice Shelf extending from the Antarctic Peninsula began to crumble in 2008, Costa realized that the data collected by his tagged seals might help oceanographers figure out why the shelf was collapsing. "I knew that we had animals that had been swimming around and collecting data in that area," he said.</p>
<p>Costa's research focuses on the food-web relationships that support large ocean predators like elephant seals and how climate change affects them. He developed and pioneered the satellite tags used in the study in collaboration with the Sea Mammal Research Unit at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland. The tags record temperature, salinity, and pressure data wherever the animals roam. Attached to the seals' fur, the instruments collect information for one year before being shed along with the fur in an annual molt.</p>
<p>The tags store data as the elephant seals dive to the bottom to search for food and then transmit it to a centralized database via the Argos satellite system when the animal surfaces. Costa's study gathered data over a period of four years, during which the seals made tens of thousands of dives to the ocean bottom. As the researchers analyzed the data, a picture of the seafloor emerged that didn't match the existing maps. The animals were diving to depths that, according to the maps, were below the sea floor.</p>
<p>The extreme conditions around Antarctica make seafloor mapping a challenge. Traditionally, ships pass over an area and take direct measurements to chart the ocean floor, but the icy waters around the Antarctic Peninsula are difficult to navigate, so many of the areas around it are charted based only on estimates gleaned indirectly from satellites.</p>
<p>When the Wilkins Ice Shelf began to disintegrate, oceanographers analyzing the waters below it needed an accurate picture of the seafloor to understand the currents swirling under the ice shelf. Thinking his data might help, Costa contacted Padman, and they began to piece together an improved picture of the ocean floor around the Antarctic Peninsula.</p>
<p>The new map they constructed shows deep troughs cut into the continental slope that deliver warm water from the open ocean past the continental slope and up into the frigid waters below the Wilkins Ice Shelf. Padman said he suspects that the warm water flow may have played a role in setting off the ice-shelf collapse.</p>
<p>The researchers reported their findings in a paper published in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>. The coauthors include Tom Bolmer of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute; Michael Goebel of the NOAA Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program; UCSC graduate student Luis Huckstadt; Adrian Jenkins and Deborah Shoosmith of the British Antarctic Survey, U.K.; and Birgitte McDonald of Scripps Institution of Oceanography.</p>
<p>For Costa, the satellite tags provided valuable information about how the Southern Ocean is changing and how large animals like the elephant seals may respond to those changes. For Padman, the seals let him see an ocean floor previously inaccessible to man. And for both, the exercise revealed a new application for an existing technology that is likely to be used again in the future.

The program, which will "tell the story of our galaxy," premiers on the National Geographic Channel on Sunday, October 24, at 9 p.m.</p>
<p>Primack said he and his graduate students were interviewed at NASA Ames Research Center, where they use NASA's most powerful supercomputer to simulate the evolution of structure in the universe. During the interview, they discussed their latest project, called the Bolshoi simulation, which is the highest-resolution large cosmological simulation yet and is becoming the basis for a new generation of cosmological models. Primack said the film crew captured a striking visualization of the Bolshoi simulation displayed on the "hyperwall," a computer-intensive wall of screens used at NASA Ames to visualize projects involving massive amounts of data.</p>

<p>Economics professor Donald Wittman won the 2010 Martin M. Chemers Award for outstanding research given annually to a senior faculty member whose research and scholarship has made a major impact on his discipline. It carries a $2,500 prize.</p>
<p>Wittman uses tools of economics to explain myriad subjects including law, democratic politics, international relations, along with some purely economic issues, and some random topics as well, such as sports rules, theocracy, and family dynamics. His most recent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Political-Economy-Handbooks-Science/dp/0199272220/sr=8-2/qid=1166399414/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/105-6729254-4902068?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books"><em>Oxford Handbook of Political Economy</em></a>, &#160;is being translated into Chinese. He joined the faculty in 1969.</p>
<p>Other awards bestowed at the breakfast were outstanding staff awards to department managers Marilyn Chapin, community studies and sociology,<br/>
 and Jo Ann McFarland, economics.&#160; Each received a plaque and $1,500. In presenting the awards, economics professor David Kaun lauded both women's skill and diplomacy in running offices during the past year of budget disruption.</p>
<p>Two graduate teaching assistants, Mahir Binici, in economics, and Cristie Boone, anthropology, received Milam-McGinty-Kaun Awards for Distinguished Teaching Each winner received $1,000.</p>
<p>Sarah Curtis, an undergraduate Latin American and Latino Studies major, received a $2,000 Walsh Family Scholarship presented by Carl Walsh, chair of the economics department.

<p>Is your information safe? Every day mobile devices are lost, stolen, and infected. A good rule of thumb is not to store anything you're not willing to lose. This said, following are several simple steps you can take to help protect information on mobile devices:</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; * Set your device to require a password/PIN and to automatically lock when not in use--but still don't store anything you're not willing to lose. A simple four-digit passcode won't keep people out for very long!</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; * Don't store sensitive information. Turn on encryption if you do.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; * Some devices can be set to be erased remotely, or to erase themselves if the password/PIN is entered incorrectly a certain number of times. Consider turning these on to protect information in the case of theft or loss.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; * Set devices to "ask" before joining networks so you don't unknowingly connect to insecure wireless networks.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; * Avoid using auto-complete features that remember user names or passwords.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; * Avoid opening files, clicking links, or calling numbers in unsolicited e-mails or text messages.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; * If your device has a web browser, set the browser to block pop-ups. For added privacy, also set the browser to limit the cookies it accepts. For example, some devices let you set the browser to accept cookies only from sites you visit.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; * Delete all contents before discarding, exchanging, or donating the device.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; * Back up your data regularly in case of theft or loss.</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160; * Immediately report lost or stolen devices that contained sensitive UCSC information or passwords to the ITS Support Center (contact info below).</p>

UCSC interim humanities dean William Ladusaw and linguistics professor James McCloskey have been elected as fellows of the Linguistic Society of America (LSA).</p>
<p>The LSA is the major professional society in the United States dedicated to the scientific study of language.</p>
<p>The organization plays a critical role in supporting and disseminating linguistic scholarship, as well as facilitating the application of current research to scientific, educational, and social issues concerning language.</p>
<p>Ladusaw has been a member of the linguistics faculty at UCSC since 1984. He does research in semantics, the study of meaning and its relation to the grammatical structure of languages.</p>
<p>Since 2004, Ladusaw served as vice provost and dean of undergraduate education at UCSC before his appointment this summer as interim dean of the Humanities&#160; Division. He was also chair of the Linguistics Department from 1997-99, and provost of Cowell College from 1997-2003.</p>
<p>McCloskey has just completed a four-year term as chair of the Linguistics Department at UCSC. He works in the area of theoretical syntax, seeking to understand the nature of the grammatical systems of human language, focusing on the Irish language (Gaelic).</p>
<p>McCloskey also does research on questions of language attrition and renewal. He joined the faculty at UCSC in 1988.<br/>

McGroddy Prize for New Materials to Arthur P. Ramirez, dean of the Jack Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz. The APS presents the McGroddy Prize each year to recognize outstanding achievement in the science and application of new materials.</p>
<p>In making the award, the selection committee cited Ramirez "for intellectual leadership leading to the identification of geometrically frustrated magnets as an important class of materials." The $10,000 prize is funded by an endowment from IBM and was established in 1997.</p>
<p>Ramirez joined UC Santa Cruz as dean of the Baskin School of Engineering in May 2009 from LGS, a subsidiary of Alcatel-Lucent. He spent much of his career at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, where he served as the director of the device physics research department before becoming leader of composite materials and device development for LGS.</p>
A fellow of the APS, Ramirez has served on the APS Council and the executive committee of the APS Division of Condensed Matter Physics. He has also served on the Solid State Sciences Committee of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. He earned his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in physics at Yale University.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c1bbee4e807270460167a2098bf7f967"><name>digital-media</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Digital media pros advise young alumni at Silicon Valley networking event</title><summary>A panel of four highly accomplished UCSC alumni with expertise in digital media shared their insights and experience with an eager crowd of younger alumni at a recent networking event held at the Google campus in Mountain View.</summary><keywords>UC Santa Cruz, UCSC alumni, digital media, computer gaming, animation, Kevin Nolting, Digby Horner, Rob Lord, Eric Ellis</keywords><start-date>1287475200000</start-date><display-name>Digital media pros advise young alumni...</display-name><path>/2010/10/digital-media</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/10/digital-media</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1287445540345</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1287445703602</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/composite-2.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/composite-2.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>composite-2.jpg</name><display-name>composite-2.jpg</display-name><file-size>63998</file-size><width>252</width><height>252</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/lord-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/lord-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lord-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>lord-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25244</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Digital media panelists included (clockwise from top left): Digby Horner, Kevin Nolting, Eric Ellis, and Rob Lord.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A panel of four highly accomplished UC Santa Cruz alumni with expertise in digital media shared their insights and experience with an eager crowd of younger alumni at a recent networking event held at the Google campus in Mountain View.</p>
<p>More than 50 participants came to the October 13 Silicon Valley young alumni networking night, where they met with seasoned pros in the areas of computer gaming, animation, and digital media. The panelists were Kevin Nolting (Porter College, 1979), an editor at Pixar Animation Studios; Digby Horner (Crown College, 1984), senior vice president of the Engineering Technologies Group at Adobe; Rob Lord (College Eight, 1994), a serial entrepreneur with nearly ten digital media start-ups under his belt; and Eric Ellis (Merrill College, 1995), head consultant for Stubborn Gorilla, a company that provides contract programming for video game development.</p>
<p>The panelists told their career stories, discussed their industry sectors, and answered questions from the audience. The panel discussion was followed by informal networking, as the panelists talked to alumni interested in their particular industry sectors.</p>
<p>"The panelists were very gracious. They made each attendee feel welcome and stayed late to interact with everyone there," said Andrew Susskind (College Nine, 2005), who came to the event from Berkeley, where he works at the Berkeley Repertory Theater. "The structure of this event reflected the mentorship feel of UCSC, and it was great to run into old friends. It reminds you that no matter where you go in life, Banana Slugs are close by."</p>
<p>Working in digital media requires strong technical skills, but much of the panel discussion focused on other qualities, in addition to technical competency, that companies are looking for in their employees. Those qualities include creativity, adaptability, and the ability to work well with others on collaborative projects.</p>
<p>"Video game development is a constantly changing field, so they want people who are creative and can adapt," Ellis said. "It's also a collaborative field--you have to work with other people--so how you present yourself is important."</p>
<p>Nolting, who started his career 25 years ago editing live-action film, shared insights into the small world of Hollywood film-making, where who you know is still paramount. His transition to digital editing required new technical skills, but Nolting said some of the most important skills for his career he acquired as an undergraduate at UCSC, where he earned a degree in aesthetic studies and creative writing. "Writing turned out to be important, because film editing is all about telling a story," he said.</p>
<p>Horner, asked what he wished he'd known when he started his career, said he was initially naive about fundamental business principles. "I was all about technical competency, but if I'd had more knowledge of how business is really done, it would have benefited me early on," he said.</p>
<p>Lord talked about the exciting world of Silicon Valley start-up companies, angel investors, and disruptive innovations. "Know your tolerance for fear," he advised. "If you're in the start-up space, you need to be prepared to fail spectacularly."</p>
<p>When it comes to pitching ideas, Lord said a digital entrepreneur needs to be able to tell the same story in three different languages. The "geek story" explains the technical innovations behind the idea; the "product story" explains what it offers to customers; and the "business story" explains how it's going to make money. "You're telling the same story, but for different audiences," he said.</p>
<p>UCSC alumni now working at Google were instrumental in hosting the event there, including Oliver Style (College Nine, 2007), who helped plan and coordinate the event. The crowd was welcomed by Vikram Sahai (M.S., computer engineering, 1992), currently a software engineer at Google.org and a longtime Google employee.

<p>The award provides a grant of over $663,000 to fund Krumholz's research and community teaching program over the next five years. CAREER grants are awarded to junior faculty teacher-scholars who show the most promise for lifelong achievement in building integrative research and education programs. Last year Krumholz received one of two Alfred P. Sloan Foundation research fellowships awarded to UCSC faculty.</p>
<p>Krumholz's ultimate research goal is to produce a fully predictive theory for how stars form. In a paper published last year, he answered the long-burning question of how stars larger than our sun can grow past the point where their radiant energy theoretically should repel the dusty materials drawn in to grow the star's mass. With the CAREER grant, he plans to focus on the nuclear reactions within stars and how their energy drives evolution of galaxies, formation of planets, and creation of heavy elements.</p>
<p>The CAREER award will also provide support for the UC Santa Cruz Project for Inmate Education, which Krumholz created last year in conjunction with UCSC Extension administrators and local correction officers. The program offers college courses to inmates confined in county detention facilities. He and other UCSC faculty and graduate students will teach the courses. The project mirrors similar programs he was involved in as a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University and as a graduate student at UC Berkeley, when he taught courses at San Quentin State Prison. The goal of the program is to bridge the gap between the scientific community and a group of people who have been largely underserved by other educational outreach efforts.</p>
<p>Krumholz joined UC Santa Cruz in 2008 after completing a Hubble, Spitzer, and Council on Science and Technology Postdoctoral Fellowship at Princeton University. He earned his Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in physics at UC Berkeley and his B.A. in physics from Princeton University.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c59cb0df807270460167a209161b3ca5"><name>party-hardly</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Party hardly: UCSC ramps up its campaign inviting students to think when they drink</title><summary>Gnomeland Security: An irreverent UCSC alcohol awareness campaign aims at decreasing risk, not condemning students for partying.</summary><keywords>party, drink, gnomes, gnomeland, SHOP, Student Health</keywords><start-date>1287475200000</start-date><display-name>Party hardly: UCSC ramps up its campaign inviting students to think when they drink</display-name><path>/2010/10/party-hardly</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/10/party-hardly</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1287510601795</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenm</last-modified-by><last-modified>1287690857091</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title>Associate editor</title><phone>(831) 459-4834</phone><email>dwhite1@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/gnomehunterkobe.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/gnomehunterkobe.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gnomehunterkobe.jpg</name><display-name>gnomehunterkobe.jpg</display-name><file-size>53321</file-size><width>300</width><height>223</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/gnomethumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/gnomethumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gnomethumb.jpg</name><display-name>gnomethumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21286</file-size><width>80</width><height>77</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p>Student intern Anya Hunter and interim SHOP coordinator Meg Kobe get the word out about "partying small'' with the help of party cups, props, and gnomes.</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/gnomedisguise.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/gnomedisguise.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gnomedisguise.jpg</name><display-name>gnomedisguise.jpg</display-name><file-size>52509</file-size><width>300</width><height>252</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Student intern Anya Hunter wears a gnome mask--and poses with a ceramic gnome--to promote SHOP's alcohol awareness campaign.

<p>Lying with her head on a table, she has no idea that a ceramic gnome is staring at her with a forlorn look on its face.</p>
<p>This image appears on a poster advertising an alcohol awareness initiative sponsored by SHOP (Student Health Outreach and Prevention), a campaign headquartered at the Student Health Center and designed to make young drinkers aware of the risks they are taking.</p>
<p>The campaign, with the pint-sized gnome as its mascot, aims at decreasing risk, not condemning students for partying.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to meet them where they are, provide education, and suggestions for reducing risks,&#8217;&#8217; said Paul Willis, UCSC&#8217;s Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) educator. "They are emerging adults. Outright prohibition doesn&#8217;t work."</p>
<p>But what do gnomes have to do with it?</p>
<p>"For one thing, gnomes are small," said Meg Kobe, interim coordinator of SHOP. Their diminutive stature helps SHOP spread the word that partiers should think small--a modest amount of partying, and a small amount of drinks--when they let loose for the weekend.</p>
<p>SHOP's campaign uses gnome-themed door hangers, Beanie Baby-style plush gnomes, and gnome T-shirts, with an ever-changing list of puns: "Gnomeland Security" and "Chillin&#8217; With My Gnomies," among others.</p>
<p>SHOP placed a full-page ad in the Student Primer Issue of <em>City On A Hill,</em> and provides "Department of Gnomeland Security" brochures to police, who distribute them to students when they intervene at unruly off-campus parties. Members of the SHOP team also appeared at a recent round of off-campus neighborhood block parties.</p>
<p>The goofiness is a means to an end. Gnome pamphlets and brochures include disturbing inventories of alcohol poisoning symptoms and lists of emergency phone numbers. &#160;And while SHOP is not responsible for enforcing drug and alcohol policy, its awareness campaign coincides with campus and city police&#8217;s stepped-up enforcement in the first few weeks of the fall semester.</p>
<p>That enforcement and the gnome-related campaign are responses to a nationwide "college effect"--a reported spike in high-risk alcohol related incidents--that takes place during the first six weeks of school.</p>
<p>As part of its alcohol education program, UCSC also requires entering first-year students to complete a two- to three-hour alcohol awareness online course that includes three surveys and an exam.</p>
<p>SHOP recruits students to give an extra layer of credibility to the project. Anya Hunter, a student who works at SHOP as part of UCSC&#8217;s Chancellor's Undergraduate Internship Program (CUIP), was sold on the non-scolding, pro-health positivity of the program.</p>
<p>Students start to run into trouble when they pound down drinks without thinking about how much they can handle, Hunter said.</p>
<p>When Hunter was out and about, talking about the "Gnome Project," several students shared their reactions. "They love how the project is not telling them what they are doing is wrong but telling them to take extra precaution," she said.</p>
<p>Kobe adds another degree of visibility by walking around the campus with a Gymboree bag crammed with simple, effective props that give students a better sense of how much liquor they are consuming.</p>
<p>"People will say, 'I don&#8217;t know what happened. I only had three drinks,'" Kobe said. But she underscored the point that looks can be deceiving when she pulled out a&#160; "party cup"--one of those 16-ounce plastic red containers found at countless keg parties.</p>
<p>Kobe likes to remind students that a "serving" of beer is just 12 ounces, four ounces less than the beer a bartender serves in a pint glass, and that "one drink" of 100-proof liquor looks like a tiny dribble when poured into the bottom of a big red party cup.</p>
<p>Drinking that little puddle of liquor is like quaffing a whole beer, even though it barely comes up to the lowest line on the party cup.</p>
<p>"Some people say, &#8216;Well, I only had one glass, which means I only had one drink,'" Kobe said. "Well, if your goblet is the size of a fish tank, you could easily have the equivalent of 12 drinks."</p>
<p>She alerts students to the hazards of self-styled &#8216;rules&#8217; that are designed to keep students out of trouble with booze but don&#8217;t hold up to analysis.</p>
<p>"You can&#8217;t quantify it by saying &#8216;one drink an hour,'" Kobe said. The trouble with that philosophy is the fact that all people are different when it comes to liquor tolerance and size.&#160; "If it&#8217;s a very small female, one drink an hour could be dangerous."</p>
<p>SHOP&#8217;s "Just Say Gnome &#8230; party small" alcohol awareness campaign is part of the Safer California Universities Project, a research project that tests the effectiveness of increased alcohol enforcement, increased visibility of enforcement, and working closely with college students.</p>

<p>The prize has been given since 1994 to a senior anthropologist in recognition of broad-based contributions to research, teaching, and service related to the development of critical studies of North America, including the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The award recognizes a distinguished long-term program of research and publication, and also takes into account contributions in other areas, such teaching and training, service to professional societies, and community, activist, practice, or policy involvements outside academia.</p>
<p>Zavella will share the award with Catherine Lutz, chair of the anthropology department at Brown University. They will receive their awards November 20 when the society holds its annual meeting in New Orleans.</p>
<p>Zavella joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 1983. Her research interests focus on U.S.-Mexico immigration issues, feminist theory, work, poverty, and sexuality.</p>
<p>In 2008, the UCSC Academic Senate selected her to deliver the Faculty Research Lecture.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c619051b807270460167a20999902cc5"><name>review-fall-2010-toc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1287475200000</start-date><display-name>Fall 2010 UCSC Review table of contents</display-name><path>/2010/10/review-fall-2010-toc</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/10/review-fall-2010-toc</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1287518749824</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenm</last-modified-by><last-modified>1287519070252</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/toc-fog-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/toc-fog-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>toc-fog-300.jpg</name><display-name>toc-fog-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>7458</file-size><width>300</width><height>146</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/toc-eden-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/toc-eden-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>toc-eden-300.jpg</name><display-name>toc-eden-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>15285</file-size><width>300</width><height>147</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/toc-artists-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/toc-artists-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>toc-artists-300.jpg</name><display-name>toc-artists-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>7958</file-size><width>300</width><height>147</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/toc-madmen-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/toc-madmen-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>toc-madmen-300.jpg</name><display-name>toc-madmen-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>14589</file-size><width>300</width><height>147</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>UC Santa Cruz 
<p><em>Review</em></p>
<p>Fall 2010</p>
<p><strong>UC Santa Cruz is 45 ... groovy</strong></p>
<p>Bob Dylan released his iconic song, "Subterranean Homesick Blues," in 1965: "You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows." The winds of change were blowing toward Santa Cruz, where a major public-research university was rising out of the coastal fog. UC Santa Cruz opened that same year with 650 students.</p>
<p><strong>Mists of time</strong></p>
<p>UC leaders founded UCSC in Santa Cruz rather than San Jose in part because of the cooling effect of the coastal marine layer. The rest is history.</p>

<p>Some are still involved in the political system, most are not. Specifically, Urban was interested in the conversations that go on among members of Russia's elites. His new book, <em>Cultures of Power in Post-Communist Russia: An Analysis of Elite Political Discourse</em> (Cambridge University Press) builds on his earlier work on politics in Russia after the Soviet era.</p>
<p>Between May 2005 and June 2006, Urban talked with members of the administrations of Mikhail Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin, and Vladimir Putin. He interviewed government ministers, including prime ministers, deputy prime ministers, and political party leaders.</p>
<p>"I let people talk," Urban said. And talk they did, although some members of the Putin regime were initially reticent. The political actors talked about their thoughts and impressions of fundamental issues of political life, society, community, the state, law, morality, and political competence.</p>
<p>Analyzing narratives from the interviews, Urban shows that Russian political discourse lacks concepts for both law and a public. "Political communication occurs through personalistic categories," Urban says. "This seems&#160; consistent with Russia's history of authoritarianism, revolution and violence."</p>
<p>Urban, who joined UC Santa Cruz in 1991, said he found some surprises in the more than 50 hours of conversations. For instance, in discussions of morality, he discovered that Russian political elites were primarily concerned with not letting their friends down.</p>
<p>That sense of morality might lead logically to what Americans could consider cronyism, and Urban found it to be a constant in Russian political discourse.</p>
<p>Urban's topic for his book was a bit serendipitous, he said. He traveled to Russia in 2005 with another idea in mind but circumstances changed. He had the good fortune of an old friend in Moscow from previous work who was able to start making connections that led to the interviews.</p>
<p>Urban's project was supported by grants from the UC Santa Cruz Academic Senate and National Council for Eurasian and East European Research.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c67f462a807270460167a2095824b437"><name>pension-meeting-campus</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pension reform recommendations draw questions and concerns at campus meeting</title><summary>Several hundred staff members, faculty, and retired employees filled Stevenson Event Center on Monday afternoon to voice concerns and ask questions about proposed changes to UC's retirement system.</summary><keywords>retirement, UCSC, pension, office of the president</keywords><start-date>1287475200000</start-date><display-name>Pension-meeting-campus</display-name><path>/2010/10/pension-meeting-campus</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/10/pension-meeting-campus</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1287525451197</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1287599390427</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title>Associate editor</title><phone>(831) 459-4834</phone><email>dwhite1@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/task_force_report.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/task_force_report.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>task_force_report.jpg</name><display-name>task_force_report.jpg</display-name><file-size>2304</file-size><width>80</width><height>76</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Several hundred staff members, faculty, and retired employees filled Stevenson Event Center on Monday afternoon to voice concerns and ask questions about <a href="http://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/ucrpfuture/">proposed changes to UC's retirement system</a>.</p>
<p>Two panel discussions took place that brought UC administrators to campus to receive feedback about the proposed plan changes. Panelists were joined by UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal and Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway.</p>
<p>A UC Office of the President task force has made a series of recommendations that may be considered by the UC Board of Regents later this fall. The changes are designed to close the gap between funds sources for the retirement plan and current and future expenditures.</p>
<p>During the two-hour meeting, Daniel Simmons, who chairs UC&#8217;s systemwide Academic Council, spoke in stark terms about the proposed changes.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;UCSC has to meet its unfunded liability and pay for the growing pension benefits of current employees,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Blumenthal expressed hope that the state government, which currently does not contribute to UC pension plans, will be convinced to &#8220;become a partner&#8217;&#8217; with the UC system.&#160;</p>
<p>Early in the meeting, about 20 protesters interrupted the group&#8217;s introductory remarks, calling the task force out of touch with the needs of lower-income staff members on campus. No one intervened to stop the brief protest, and the speakers resumed when it was over.</p>
<p>The discussion also included highly technical queries about the board&#8217;s methodology.</p>
<p>Video of the sessions will be accessible soon from the campus's <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/budget-update/">Budget Update web site</a>. The site also includes four fact sheets prepared in advance of Monday's forums.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c6b171a3807270460167a20937bd6e58"><name>review-fall-2010-masthead</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Review--fall 2010 masthead</title><start-date>1287475200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Review--fall 2010 masthead</display-name><path>/2010/10/review-fall-2010-masthead</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/10/review-fall-2010-masthead</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1287528739040</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenm</last-modified-by><last-modified>1288978519444</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><h2>UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ</h2>

<p>A sampling of reader reaction to recent issues of the UC Santa Cruz Review. E-mail us at <a href="mailto:review@ucsc.edu">review@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>'State of confusion' confusion</strong></h2>
<p>I am confused after reading "<a href="http://review.ucsc.edu/spring10/article.asp?pid=3774">State of confusion</a>." Do you think that presenting the something-for-nothing viewpoint of the GOP and the Tea Party movement will ingratiate yourself to their modest thought processes? Or maybe it's their pocketbooks that you are appealing to? The fair and balanced reporting of Faux News is not what I what I expect from a university publication.</p>
<p>Proposition 13 and other such initiatives passed by popular support are symbols of failure and poor governance. A representative government that plays second fiddle to mob rule (initiative polling) is not a sustainable vehicle for the people or institutions of California.</p>
<p><em>&#8212;Peter Burkett (Merrill '78)<br/>
Granite Falls, Wash.</em></p>
<p>After reading the discus&#173;sion between Laird and Morgan I was shocked by the figure Morgan claimed that California has $500 billion (and growing) unfunded public pension obligations. Was that the correct figure or was it supposed to be $500 million? If it's the correct amount, we are so screwed.</p>
<p><em>&#8212;Kevin Kelem<br/>
Santa Cruz, Calif.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Ed. note:</em></strong> <em>$500 bil</em><em>&#173;</em><em>lion is correct, according to the Stanford Institute for Economic Research. <a href="http://californiawatch.org/watchblog/states-pension-liability-tops-500-billion-stanford-study-finds">Read a report about the study</a>.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Don't just feed us feel-good stories</strong></h2>
<p><em>Review</em> is not what it could be. For many of us, it's the only regular contact that we have with the university. I'm really not looking for a bunch of feel-good stories. I can deal with a few, but not a whole magazine.</p>
<p>At least some alumni are looking for a little more than the typical corporate PR ap&#173;proach to communication. An example of where the <em>Review</em> really falls short is having the narrative evalua&#173;tion decision by the Academic Senate buried at the end on the Alumni Notes page ("<a href="http://review.ucsc.edu/spring10/article.asp?pid=3726">Narrative evaluations become instruc&#173;tor optional</a>"). To my mind, it should have been up front as it represents for many of us a significant loss of UCSC's heritage and soul.</p>

<h2><strong>Paper view</strong></h2>
<p>I spend eight hours a day in front of a computer for work (and have done so for 20-plus years), and when I get done with that, I simply do not want to read another sentence on a screen. For me, the online version of the UCSC <em>Review</em> was simply a no-go. Thanks for bringing back the paper!</p>
<p><em>&#8212;Lisa Schaechter (Crown '83)</em></p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised to read your comments about the "value of the printed word" ("<a href="http://review.ucsc.edu/spring10/article.asp?pid=3759">From the editor</a>"), especially in a publication such as this. I understand the financial dif&#173;ficulties we are all faced with and appreciate that you were able to reallocate funding to allow the <em>Review</em> to be pro&#173;duced. I do find the Internet helpful and it has its place, but being able to hold this publication and read through it &#8230; the web site is a distant substitution.</p>

<h2><strong>The other meaning of 'green revolution'</strong></h2>
<p>The title of the article "<a href="http://review.ucsc.edu/spring10/article.asp?pid=3785">Cathy Calfo: An advocate of the green revolution</a>" could be interpreted in a wrong way since the term "green revolution" has been associated with industrialized monocrops, highly dependent on chemicals and so destruc&#173;tive of the environment and agriculturalists who worked on such lands.</p>

<p>Abraham Seiden, professor of physics, has led the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) since its founding in 1981. At the end of June, he stepped down as director of SCIPP and returned to full-time teaching and research.</p>
<p>"It's been 30 years and I thought this was a good time to step down," Seiden said. "We've broadened the scope of our research programs dramatically, and I'm very proud of the scientists and staff we have. It's been an honor to help facilitate these programs."</p>
<p>Steven Ritz, a professor of physics who has been associate director of SCIPP since joining the UCSC faculty last year, replaced Seiden as director.</p>

<p class="callout-right"><img alt="Jerry Nelson" height="266" src="images/tiucsc-nelson-jerry-200.jpg" width="200"/></p>
<p>Jerry Nelson, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, received the $1 million Kavli Prize in Astrophysics along with two other researchers for their innovations in the field of telescope design.</p>
<p>The achievements of Nelson and his co-recipients&#8212;Roger Angel of the University of Arizona, Tucson, and Ray Wilson, formerly of Imperial College London and the European Southern Observatory&#8212;have made possible the building of telescopes that can see deeper into space and further back in time.</p>
<p>Nelson, Angel, and Wilson are among eight scientists whose discoveries in the fields of astrophysics, nanoscience, and neuroscience have been recognized with the award of the 2010 Kavli Prizes, announced in June by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. The laureates each received a scroll, a gold medal, and a share of the $1 million prize for each of the three fields.</p>
<p>Nelson is internationally renowned as a developer of innovative designs for advanced telescopes.</p>
<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal accompanied Nelson to the ceremony in Oslo, Norway, in September, when Nelson was presented with the award.</p>
<h2 class="clear-both"><strong>Disease threatens bats with regional extinction</strong></h2>
<p class="callout-right"><img alt="Little brown bats" height="206" src="images/tiucsc-bats-200.jpg" width="200"/></p>
<p>A new infectious disease spreading rapidly across the northeastern United States has killed millions of bats and is predicted to cause regional extinction of a once-common bat species, according to the findings of a UCSC researcher.</p>
<p>The disease, white-nose syndrome, first discovered near Albany, N.Y., in 2006, affects hibernating bats, writes lead author Winifred F. Frick, in a study published in <em>Science</em>.</p>
<p>Frick, a UC Santa Cruz graduate (Porter '98, environmental studies) who is now a post-doctoral researcher in UCSC's Environmental Studies department, said the disease is spreading quickly across the northeastern U.S. and Canada. If death rates continue as they have over the past four years, this disease will likely lead to the regional extinction of the little brown myotis, previously one of the most common species in North America, she said.</p>
<p>The loss of so many bats "is basically a terrible experiment in how much these animals matter for insect control," Frick said.</p>
<h2><strong>UCSC goes dot-fabulous</strong></h2>
<p>UC Santa Cruz in late August launched a newly designed campus <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/index.html">home page</a> and a number of related upper-level web pages. The structure and design of these pages reflect input from faculty, staff, students, alumni, and others. The new pages are part of a comprehensive web improvement program, co-led by the campus's University Relations and Information Technology Services divisions.</p>

<h2><strong>New major: Jewish Studies</strong></h2>
<p>Students at UC Santa Cruz will now have the opportunity to work toward a B.A. degree in Jewish Studies, beginning this fall.</p>
<p>The Jewish Studies major will provide knowledge of Jewish thought, literature, art, and history&#8212;with classes taught by faculty across the Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences divisions.</p>
<p>The launching of the new major is largely due to the efforts of Murray Baumgarten, who has been teaching courses and mentoring students in Jewish Studies for several decades at UCSC.</p>
<p>Three other programs also launched this fall: a bachelor's program in cognitive science, and doctoral programs in film and digital media and visual studies.</p>
<h2><strong>A Writer's Life celebrates writing at UC Santa Cruz</strong></h2>
<p>UC Santa Cruz alumni from all areas of the writing and publishing professions will return to campus on Sunday, May 1, 2011, to celebrate the art and business of writing. Sponsored by the Division of Humanities, the program will include sessions on fiction and nonfiction writing, nature and science writing, writing for children and young adults, journalism, and more.</p>
<p>The event, called <a href="http://writerslife.ucsc.edu/">A Writer's Life</a>, is free and open to the public. It dovetails with UCSC's <a href="http://ucsc.edu/daybythebay/">Reunion Weekend Intellectual Forum</a>, to be held April 30, which will include a roundtable with best-selling alumni authors.</p>
<p>The keynote speaker is David Talbot, founder of Salon.com and best-selling author of <em>Brothers: The Hidden History of the Kennedy Years</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Authors follow Grateful Dead's philanthropic model</strong></p>
<p class="callout-right"><img alt="Marketing Lessons from the Grateful Dead" height="294" src="images/tiucsc-dead-200.jpg" width="200"/></p>
<p>Inspired by a thought-provoking article in <em>Atlantic</em> magazine titled "Management Secrets of the Grateful Dead," Boston writers David Meerman Scott and Brian Halligan recently published a book called <em>Marketing Lessons from the Grateful Dead.</em></p>
<p>Including a foreword by basketball legend Bill Walton, plus photos by longtime Dead photographer Jay Blakesberg, the book describes how the band's marketing strategy has become the quintessential model for the Internet age.</p>
<p>But here's the best part: 25 percent of the royalties will be donated directly to UCSC's Grateful Dead Archive.</p>
<p>"The Grateful Dead were famous for their devotion to charitable causes," explained Nicholas Meriwether, UCSC's Grateful Dead archivist, "and that is another lesson from the band that David and Brian took to heart."</p>
<h2><strong>Girls discover engineering potential</strong></h2>
<p class="callout-right"><img alt="Girls in Engineering" height="162" src="images/tiucsc-girls-engineering-200.jpg" width="300"/>Photo by Guy Lasnier</p>
<p>Twenty-nine middle school girls graduated from the fourth annual Girls in Engineering program this summer. The seventh- and eighth-grade girls from schools in Monterey and Santa Cruz counties conducted experiments, built towers with toothpicks and marshmallows, programmed software to control robots, and devised packaging to help an egg survive a plunge from the third floor of the Baskin School of Engineering to the sidewalk below. Along the way they had daily visits from women employed in various engineering fields and enjoyed field trips to such places as Google's campus in Mountain View.</p>
<p>UCSC benefactors Jack Baskin and wife Peggy Downes Baskin have supported the program conducted with UCSC's Educational Partnership Center since it began in 2006.</p>
<h2><strong>Meet new Campus Provost Alison Galloway</strong></h2>
<p class="callout-right"><img alt="Alison Galloway" height="136" src="images/tiucsc-galloway-200.jpg" width="200"/>Photo by Jim MacKenzie</p>
<p>Professor of anthropology Alison Galloway was selected as UCSC's new campus provost/executive vice chancellor. She started her new job in September, replacing former CP/EVC Dave Kliger.</p>
<p>"A big part of my job will be to anticipate what's coming and be sure we are prepared," said Galloway. In an era of tight budgets, she plans to make fiscal decisions with an eye toward what will best serve faculty and students.</p>
<p>Galloway stepped down as vice provost of academic affairs and dean of UCSC Extension. She has also served previously as chair of the UCSC Academic Senate, campus diversity officer for faculty, and department chair of anthropology.</p>
<p>Galloway was selected by Chancellor George Blumenthal and approved by the UC Regents.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cb7ea676807270460167a209c356f09b"><name>zipcar-expansion</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Zipcar Expansion in the Santa Cruz Community</title><summary>Four additional Zipcars are now available in Santa Cruz for use by all eligible UCSC students, staff and faculty. </summary><start-date>1287561600000</start-date><display-name>Zipcar Expansion in the Santa Cruz Community</display-name><path>/2010/10/zipcar-expansion</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/10/zipcar-expansion</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1287609296392</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1287699179399</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am pleased to announce that four additional Zipcars are now available in Santa Cruz for use by all eligible UCSC students, staff and faculty. These four vehicles complement the nine cars currently available on campus and downtown with three new off-campus locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Downtown Santa Cruz at the "Walnut Tree" public parking lot on Cedar Street between Union and Center Streets;</li>
<li>Olive Street at Mission, near the Westside Bike Shuttle pick-up point; and</li>
<li>Blackburn Street near Laurel Street.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following its launch in Fall 2007, the UCSC campus quickly became one of the most successful university-oriented Zipcar program sites in the nation. Thanks to the popularity of this program, the County of Santa Cruz is working with Ecology Action, the City of Santa Cruz, and UCSC TAPS to expand car sharing into the community. Of the nearly 900 current members, approximately 20 percent are faculty, staff or community members who reside off-campus&#8212;as do many of the student members.</p>
<p>Besides providing additional capacity and convenience to off-campus Zipcar users, this program expansion fulfills an element of the Climate Action Compact between UCSC, the County and City of Santa Cruz. By providing "wheels when you want them," car sharing helps lower your carbon footprint and eliminate the cost of owning your own car.</p>

The rest is history.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>It's the dog days of August, and the thermometer says 62 degrees. Out on the beach, no one dares to wear a Speedo. Tourists stand around in heavy fog, shivering in Polartech hoodies. It's easy to read the expressions on their faces: We drove all the way over the hill for <em>this?</em></p>
<p>On chilly days, it's hard not to curse Santa Cruz's marine layer, the cooling air pattern that drives temperatures down. But the marine layer is responsible for more than just seasonal affective disorder and strange beachwear.</p>
<p>It also brings the fog, which feeds the redwoods and moistens the banana slugs. It keeps Santa Cruzans cool while the masses melt in places like Atlanta and New York City. And it played a decisive role in luring a University of California campus to Santa Cruz, forever changing the Central Coast, while helping to steer the course of the university over 45 years.</p>
<h2><strong>A hot and sweaty bus</strong></h2>
<p>To those who grew up with a UC in their backyard, it may be hard to imagine the Central Coast without it. After all, the people who designed the UCSC campus worked hard to create the illusion that the campus arose naturally from its surroundings.</p>
<p>The decision to put a UC school in Santa Cruz may also seem obvious, natural, even inevitable now.</p>
<p>But it wasn't then. A half-century ago, when the UC Regents were trying to choose between San Jose's Almaden Valley and Santa Cruz as the site for a new UC campus, Santa Cruz was just a second-place contender.</p>
<p>In 1960, the Regents had all but made up their minds to build in Almaden Valley, the logical choice, thanks to the large population base in the city of San Jose.</p>
<p>According to UCSC founding chancellor Dean McHenry, in his detailed oral history of the campus, a trusted adviser to the Regents "virtually adopted" the San Jose/Almaden Valley site. In other words, for proponents of the Almaden plan, it was their battle to lose. "And then," McHenry said, "Santa Cruz began to fight back &#8230;"</p>
<p>After an outspoken group, including then Santa Cruz Sentinel editor Gordon "Scotchie" Sinclair, urged reconsideration, a Regents' committee&#8212;including McHenry, who would go on to become UCSC's founding chancellor&#8212;decided to humor them in the spirit of fair-mindedness. A delegation, consisting of two-thirds of the UC Regents, boarded a bus in the fall of 1960 to tour both the Santa Cruz and Almaden Valley sites.</p>
<p>McHenry, who was part of that tour group, had few expectations, though he always thought Santa Cruz was "by far the prettier of the two."</p>
<p>First, the group hit Santa Cruz, where a delegation, including Cabrillo College trustee Harold "Hal" Hyde, an ardent proponent of a local UC campus, was there to meet them. Hyde had his hopes up&#8212;but at the same time he was well aware that certain outsiders then regarded Santa Cruz as a backwater.</p>
<p>On that fateful day, Hyde&#8212;who would go on to become a founding vice chancellor of UC Santa Cruz, playing a key role in campus planning and development&#8212;knew the Regents' decision was hanging in the balance.</p>
<div class="callout-right wide">
<h3>Mist and mysticism</h3>
<p><img alt="Elizabeth McKenzie" height="181" src="images/mists-mckenzie-200.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;" width="200"/>UCSC's pioneers found the marine-layer-cooled weather in Santa Cruz refreshing and inviting, but the climate here also serves as a fount of inspiration for the many poets, writers, and artists who cluster around the campus.</p>
<p>The local weather figures prominently in a story collection by author and Kresge lecturer Elizabeth McKenzie that involves a character named Ann Ransom driving the poet Allen Ginsberg up the coast from the UCSC campus.</p>
<p>"We crawled forward, penetrating the fog as if we were exploring the inside of a mattress ... "</p>
<p>McKenzie said the fog is "essential to the Santa Cruz writing experience. It's a foxy obfuscator of the landscape and one's perceptions. It makes you want to stay inside and drink. Or at least get to work. Fog and confusion are the writer's friends&#8212;'the straight way was lost' is the theme of all literature."</p>
<p>The fog transforms the very landscape of UCSC. As McKenzie writes in one of her stories, "It's one of the few things that can make everything seem different when you're in exactly the same place."</p>
</div>
<p>"It was an Indian summer day," Hyde remembered, in a recent phone interview. "A beautiful day in the fall and pretty warm for Santa Cruz, but there was just a slight breeze coming in off the coast."</p>
<p>Hyde, in his own oral history of UCSC, remarked that "the whole sweep of the bay stretched out beautifully from the Cowell Ranch out across toward Monterey."</p>
<p>After witnessing the splendor of Santa Cruz in great comfort, the Regents drove off to Almaden Valley, where their "oohing" and "ahhing" gave way to groans of misery. The sun pounded them.</p>
<p>The local chamber of commerce feared their comfy, air-conditioned bus was too wide to make it up a narrow vineyard road leading to the Almaden Valley site, and asked the Regents to board two smaller buses with no air-conditioning. This simple decision turned out to be a game-changer.</p>
<p>"It was very hot," McHenry recalled in the oral history, "and men began to peel their coats off, and we finally got up on top of the hill and looked down, and it was &#8230; very warm and wasn't particularly attractive &#8230;. You could see the subdivisions creeping up on this area."</p>
<p>Later, when the Regents had settled into a sweltering, non&#8211;air-conditioned clubhouse, there wasn't enough ice in the bar to cool the beverages down&#8212;yet another fatal error. Finally, one of the Regents shouted out, "Why, it'd cost a fortune to air-condition a campus there!"</p>
<p>"Santa Cruz had real luck on the day that was chosen," McHenry remembered. "If it had been thick fog down here and proper over there, it might have been another story."</p>
<p>The first students began classes at UC Santa Cruz in the fall of 1965.</p>
<h2><strong>Marine focus strengthens</strong></h2>
<p>Building a campus in Santa Cruz helped establish the campus's priorities, especially in the sciences.</p>
<p>Early on the campus committed itself to marine science, said Distinguished Professor of Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences Gary Griggs, who has taught at UCSC since 1968. As early as 1960&#8212;even before the Regents had chosen Santa Cruz as a site&#8212;the campus leaders recognized that marine sciences would be an area of "special significance" for a new UC campus, Griggs said. "It was in the early campus plans, and the original faculty had at least a couple of marine scientists."</p>
<div class="callout-right wide">
<h3>What is this 'marine layer'?</h3>
<p>What is this mysterious force, the marine layer, which helped transform Santa Cruz&#8212;an area that was once the exclusive domain of agriculture and tourism?</p>
<p>The marine layer is a body of moist, ocean-cooled air, which forms above the water and floats over nearby lowlands. The thickness can range from a few hundred to a few thousand feet.</p>
<p>This cold air lingers and drives down surface temperatures on land because it cannot escape. The Monterey Bay's chilly waters cool the air that hovers above the ocean, but warmer air rises, capping and entrapping the colder air.</p>
<p>On high humidity days, fog drifts across the marine layer, up over the foothills, and through the coastal redwoods.</p>
</div>
<p>But when Santa Cruz became the official spot, supporters of a marine division redoubled their focus.</p>
<p>Biology professor Bill Doyle, though not a marine scientist, helped plan and develop the marine science program. He founded and became the long-term director of the Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS). The late Kenneth Norris, a pioneering whale and dolphin researcher, headed UCSC's nascent marine program in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Both realized the need for a facility with access to running ocean water. UCSC considered Pigeon Point, nearly 30 miles up the coast, but then the Younger family decided to give UCSC the land along the bluffs on the north end of Santa Cruz where part of UCSC's marine lab is now located. Retired developer and engineer Jack Baskin and Longs Drugs co-founder Joseph Long were major early benefactors.</p>
<p>While Griggs feels that a landlocked Almaden Valley UC campus might have had some marine focus, it would have paled compared with the UCSC version.</p>
<p>"Look at UC Berkeley," he said. "It has a few marine biologists, but it doesn't have a marine science institute or an ocean sciences department. The fact that you can get down to the shore in five minutes, you can see the ocean from campus &#8212;it makes the difference."</p>
<h2><strong>Atmospheric variations</strong></h2>
<p>Of course, it would be an oversimplification to say that the Regents chose Santa Cruz solely because of the weather. The board also found that buying the Cowell Ranch site was considerably less complicated than purchasing the Almaden Valley site. The Regents were wary of the multi-million-dollar price tag for the San Jose area properties that made up the Almaden site and of the multiple landowners who might hold out for top dollar.</p>
<p>But the marine layer certainly helped. The new campus was dubbed University of California, Santa Cruz, in early spring of 1961, shortly before McHenry was named founding chancellor.</p>
<p>Aside from merely luring a UC campus to town, the marine layer, in many ways, gave the campus an identity and direction.</p>
<p>As Griggs pointed out, the marine layer is the result of a process known as upwelling, in which chilly water rises to the surface of the Monterey Bay, cooling the air above it.</p>
<p>The same upwelling lifts nutrients from the ocean floor, which activate diatoms and other plankton, which feed sardines, anchovies, and squid, which feed an array of marine mammals and birds, which feed the careers and research of UCSC marine scientists.</p>
<p>Strikingly, the same marine layer that keeps cool air from leaking out also prevents distinguished faculty from leaking out.</p>
<p>"The climate brought the university here&#8212;but it also kept people here," said Griggs, who is also director of the Institute of Marine Sciences. "The turnover rate on the faculty is very, very small. In Earth Sciences I know of two people who left&#8212;one who did not get tenure and another from Australia who got a big offer to go back there. Most people who come here spend their whole career here."</p>
<p>In fact, Griggs attributed an uncanny combination of climate and university-inspired culture to the flourishing literary scene, arts scene, and the sheer number of potters, writers, explorers, thinkers, and former UC students who settled here for good.</p>
<p>"Certainly, part of it is the fact that we are working at a world-class university," Griggs said. But he wondered out loud if all those faculty members, artists, and students would have stayed if that world-class university were located somewhere inland, smoggy and hot, far from the fabled marine layer.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't have," he said with a smile.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cfa7c2f080727046005a88030cb7484f"><name>marine-mammals</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Researchers investigate marine mammal behavior and responses to sound</title><summary>A team of researchers recently completed a two-month research project off the Southern California coast, part of a collaboration to study marine mammal behavior and responses to sounds in the ocean.</summary><keywords>Brandon Southall, marine mammals, ocean noise, sound, military sonar, marine mammal behavior</keywords><start-date>1287648000000</start-date><display-name>Researchers investigate marine mammal behavior</display-name><path>/2010/10/marine-mammals</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/10/marine-mammals</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1287679099522</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenm</last-modified-by><last-modified>1288121350810</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Mario Aguilera</name><title>Scripps Institution of Oceanography</title><phone/><email>scrippsnews@ucsd.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/gmoney.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/gmoney.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gmoney.jpg</name><display-name>gmoney.jpg</display-name><file-size>15992</file-size><width>306</width><height>197</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/tag-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/tag-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tag-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>tag-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19445</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p>Greg Schorr of Cascadia Research prepares to tag a Risso's dolphin during SOCAL-10.

<p>Brandon Southall, the overall project lead, is a research associate with the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz and founder of an environmental consulting company, Southall Environmental Associates (SEA) of Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>The interdisciplinary collaboration of biologists and acousticians specializing in marine mammal biology, ecology, and behavior--called SOCAL-10 (Southern California 2010)--is extending ongoing studies of basic biology, feeding behavior, and responses to human activity in a number of marine mammal species, including large whales and several smaller cetacean species. The project is part of a five-year study funded by the U.S. Navy and coordinated with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), but primarily being conducted by independent academic and research groups.</p>
<p><br/>
"The overall objective is to provide a direct scientific basis for estimating risk and minimizing the impact of human sound, and particularly those from military sonars, for navies and regulators," Southall said.<br/>
<br/>
SOCAL-10 included tagging, tracking, and acoustic experiments on nine different marine mammal species to study basic behavioral patterns and how these animals may change their behavior when they hear different sounds, including Navy sonar.<br/>
<br/>
A scouting trip and first experimental phase of the project focused primarily inshore and on behavior and responses of blue, fin, and sperm whales.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>Favorable weather conditions and an unusual abundance of large whales off Southern California led to a tremendous amount of data being collected during these phases in August and early September. More than 50 acoustic, dive, and location-orienting sensors were attached to individuals of seven different marine mammal species (blue, sei, fin, sperm, killer, and Baird's beaked whales, in addition to bottlenose dolphin), resulting in a large set of basic biological and behavioral data. The deployments of tags on sei and Baird's beaked whales were the first of their kind on the U.S. West Coast and will provide critical data about the movement and behavior of these little known species.<br/>
<br/>
The second experimental phase began September 21 from the Scripps research vessel Sproul in collaboration with John Hildebrand, a professor of oceanography at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, and focused on offshore species including beaked whales, sperm whales, and Risso's dolphins. Researchers tagged and conducted the first-ever controlled sound-exposure experiment with a Cuvier's beaked whale, which is the species most commonly present in sonar-associated marine mammal strandings. Additionally, the first-ever successful acoustic tag and exposure study on a Risso's dolphin was conducted.<br/>
<br/>
"By working with the Navy in the instrumented Southern California Offshore Range, we were able to readily locate Cuvier's beaked whales, elusive animals, that are primarily found in deepwater offshore areas," said Hildebrand.<br/>
<br/>
"The researchers involved in SOCAL-10 hope the project contributes to a greater understanding of biologically important areas, how marine mammals dive and communicate, and to understand how Navy activities impact them," said John Calambokidis of Cascadia Research Collective (CRC).<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>Preliminary results based primarily on observed behavior were variable, suggesting overt responses in some conditions, and indicated variation by species, behavioral state, and type of sound. However, researchers will take months to analyze and interpret the nearly 400 hours of tag data from the project, as well as thousands of marine mammal observations and photographs. The data from the tags will provide a more clear and objective way to assess reactions, pending additional analysis.<br/>
<br/>
Most importantly this provides the first data on the reaction of some of these species to specific types of sound and fills a critical gap in knowledge. SOCAL-10 is the first project to rigorously measure marine mammal response to the types of military sonar sounds that have been associated with previous marine mammal stranding events in specific circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, SOCAL-10 had 62 successful tag attachments (using six kinds of tags) on 44 individual animals representing nine marine mammal species. Scientists also conducted 28 controlled sound-exposure experiments. In these experiments, animals were monitored with suction cup acoustic sensors, remote listening devices, and specialized observers with high-powered binoculars. Sounds were played to the animals under specific protocols and protective measures to ensure the animals were not harmed and any changes in behavior were measured.<br/>
<br/>
The project was led by Southall and Calambokidis and included scientists from CRC, SEA, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, NOAA, Duke University, Naval Undersea Warfare Center and SPAWAR Systems Pacific.<br/>

<p>The BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico continues to remind us that the ocean and coasts are woefully mismanaged and the agencies with jurisdiction are severely underfunded.</p>
<p>However, in July we also saw President Obama sign an executive order ushering in our first federally recognized National Ocean Policy. The House of Representatives added to that victory by passing a regional ocean governance structure and ocean trust fund.</p>
<p>The president's executive order establishes a comprehensive, integrated national policy for stewardship of the ocean. It creates a new National Ocean Council to provide sustained, high-level, coordinated attention to ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes issues.</p>
<p>On the legislative side, the House passed the Consolidated Land, Energy, and Aquatic Resources Act, known as the CLEAR Act. In addition to addressing the country's oil spill prevention and response needs, the CLEAR Act mirrors the regional ocean governance portions and trust fund set forth in my Oceans-21 legislation.</p>
<p>Oceans-21 was written to provide the mechanisms needed to establish better coordination, collaboration, funding, and research to protect, conserve, and sustainably manage our essential ocean and coastal resources, and I&#8217;m proud that it has served as a model for this year's triumphs.</p>
<p>These legislative gains are huge, and the future of ocean and coastal health starts now. But we must remember that Oceans-21, the executive order, and the findings of the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force, the Pew Oceans Commission, and the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy would not have been possible without sound ocean research and science supporting their guiding principles.</p>
<p>To that end, I couldn&#8217;t be prouder to represent a district that boasts one of the most diverse marine ecosystems and that is home to an internationally recognized center for marine science with 23 institutions and counting.</p>
<p>Included in this group are UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences, Center for Ocean Health, and Seymour Marine Discovery Center at Long Marine Laboratory. UCSC professors Mark Carr and Pete Raimondi are fine examples of the great work being done at the school. Their expertise in coastal biology and marine ecology put the university's Institute of Marine Sciences on the cutting edge of coastal ecosystem research that informs policy makers on how to best manage our ocean and coastal resources.</p>
<p>The partnerships UCSC has formed with agencies like the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the California Department of Fish and Game have created an unmatched synergy of science, research, and discovery on the Monterey Bay, making it a premier point of contact to help guide progressive ocean and coastal policies.</p>
<p>While it has been painful to watch the oil tragedy unfold in the Gulf of Mexico, it has been inspirational to see both the executive and legislative branches take action and make positive strides forward for the health and sustainability of our invaluable ocean and coastal resources.</p>

than grit, humor, and creativity. Where are they now?</article-subhead><article-text><p>The three young artists and professors had no department, no center, no studios of their own. They drifted from place to place like pollen&#8212;and some of their fellow faculty members seemed to be allergic. It might have been the turpentine fumes.</p>
<p>Or it might have been the weird sounds coming from makeshift art classrooms in the campus library and the communications office. &#8220;We made odors and noise,&#8217;&#8217; said Doug McClellan, 88, professor emeritus of art and an accomplished maker of three-dimensional art boxes. &#8220;Remarks were made. We were looked on as interlopers because we had stuff that smelled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a class&#8212;rather messy, I recall&#8212;in the basement of one of the buildings,&#8217;&#8217; said Jack Zajac, 80, an internationally known sculptor and also emeritus art professor.</p>
<p>In many ways it was a chaotic time for McClellan, Zajac, and the painter Don Weygandt, now 84.</p>
<p>They started teaching at UC Santa Cruz when the campus, founded in 1965, was still brand new. All departments were vying for space. But sometimes, having no options is a form of freedom. They set up in storage rooms, among the cows in a field, and on the first and third floors of Applied Sciences. Weygandt arrived in 1967; Zajac in 1969; and McClellan two years later, after Zajac brought him on board.</p>
<p>If you worked as an art professor at UCSC, it helped if you were an accomplished hiker. Instructors hoofed it several miles a day to get to their makeshift, itinerant classrooms. And somehow, through all that craziness, Weygandt, McClellan, and Zajac put on gallery shows, guided thousands of students, and forged a friendship that lasts to this day.</p>
<p>These and other UCSC art pioneers did more than just influence the direction of UCSC&#8217;s art department. They gave students a new way of existing in the world, said Andrea Hesse, a UCSC alumna (Porter &#8217;83, art history) who has worked with Zajac on an exhibition and took classes from both McClellan and Weygandt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I learned how to hand-sharpen our pencils, using sand paper to file them to a precise point,&#8221; Hesse said. &#8220;Having that close a relationship to your materials, to your medium, and to your craft was very important. When I think about art as life, Doug is the person I learned that from.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their art classes changed lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Often, students who really lost themselves in the classes would go out into nature and see colors, forms, and relationships that weren&#8217;t present before in quite that way,&#8221; Weygandt said. &#8220;What you are really teaching them is another language that they have already, but one that they had not been allowed to exercise and develop.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Drawing up a department</h2>
<div class="callout-right"><img alt="Monoprint maker Don Weygandt" height="357" src="images/weygandt-don-400.jpg" width="400"/>Monoprint maker Don Weygandt</div>
<p>After arriving on the UCSC campus, the artists were brimming with ideas. Prior to teaching at UCSC, McClellan chaired the art department at Scripps College, one of the Claremont Colleges, and the Claremont Graduate School M.F.A. program.</p>
<p>Weygandt, son of a coal miner, studied art on the GI Bill, as did McClellan. He was lured to UCSC by the sculptor and art professor Gurdon Woods, who was a former director of the San Francisco Art Institute, where Weygandt had taught art alongside such luminaries as abstract painter Richard Diebenkorn, a longtime friend and colleague.</p>
<p>Zajac had been in Italy on a prestigious Prix de Rome art prize. His trips to the countryside outside the city inspired his lifetime fascination with the goats, sheep, and &#8220;poetic caprice of water&#8221; that figure prominently in his work. One of his works, &#8220;Sacrificial Goat&#8221;&#8212;dedicated to two members of UCSC&#8217;s pioneer class who died in the Vietnam War&#8212;still stands at Cowell College.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the time we all got to UCSC, each of us had accumulated a kind of vocabulary, a teaching syllabus drawn from our personal experience,&#8221; Weygandt said.</p>
<p>Those early students were &#8220;wonderful,&#8221; McClellan said. &#8220;They had never really taken art courses. Wow, they were raw, but so smart and motivated.&#8221;</p>
<p>With such inspired pupils, who needs a proper classroom? Zajac liked to teach sculpture out on the pond at nearby Westlake Park, using a wax made of paraffin, beeswax, and resin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a station wagon with a burner in the back,&#8221; Zajac said. &#8220;We&#8217;d melt the wax and go out to look at the grebes and ducks and geese. They would swim and sleep and fly and sometimes attack us. The students would get a handful of wax and look at these creatures and try to replicate these images in forms that could fit in your hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>A formal art department did not even exist until several years after they started teaching at UCSC.</p>
<h2>Practice and hard work</h2>
<div class="callout-right"><img alt="Art box maker Doug McClellan" height="440" src="images/mcclellan-doug-300.jpg" width="300"/>Art box maker Doug McClellan</div>
<p>These days, the three men have been retired, and senior citizens, for almost the same nmber of years that they taught at UCSC. The art landscape at UCSC has utterly transformed since the time they taught there.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t even recognize my way around up there,&#8221; said their colleague Hardy Hanson, who, like the others, is long since retired. UCSC now has a lavish arts complex including the Elena Baskin Visual Arts Center&#8212;which opened too late for them to make full use of it&#8212;and a $35 million Digital Arts Research Center, which opened this year and would have sounded like a science-fiction daydream in the &#8217;60s. But in those scrappy early days of art-making at UCSC, they made do without fancy facilities.</p>
<p>McClellan worked hard to disarm the students, to free them from self-consciously trying to do &#8220;good work&#8221; by giving them prompts that would surprise them and catch them off guard in a low-pressure way. &#8220;The spirit of play has always been important to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like his cohorts, Zajac emphasized hard work and inspiration. &#8220;Some of the students were enthusiastic but somewhat hopeful that art would come without the work it requires,&#8221; Zajac said.</p>
<p>The campus continues to build on the tradition established by UCSC&#8217;s art pioneers, said Dean of the Arts David Yager. &#8220;It&#8217;s incredible for me, talking to alumni from the first, second, and third classes and realizing that their experience is very similar to the kind of experience I want our students to have now,&#8221; Yager said. &#8220;Although some of the tools students use have changed, it&#8217;s still about the content and the ideas.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Still vital after all these years</h2>
<div class="callout-right wide">
<h3>New Arts Division fund honors pioneer arts faculty</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s pioneer arts faculty helped establish the campus&#8217;s visual arts, music, and theater departments.</p>
<p>Now they are about to get the recognition they so richly deserve. Two alumni from pioneer classes&#8212;Jock Reynolds, class of 1969, and Peder Jones, class of 1970&#8212;have teamed up with several other pioneer-era alumni to form a special endowment fund honoring influential arts faculty from the early years of UCSC.</p>
<p>The Division of the Arts has just announced the formation of the Pioneer Faculty Endowed Fund: A Legacy for the Future of the Arts&#8212;which will provide annual awards to students and faculty.</p>
<p>"Those awards will support and sustain direct contact between faculty and student artists," said Lesley Brander, director of development for the Division of the Arts. "Reynolds and Jones felt their education was based on the fact that these teachers took the time to mentor students one-on-one. This endowment will encourage and preserve that spirit of mentorship.</p>
<p>"Their experience with those faculty significantly changed their lives," Brander continued. &#8220;This comes out of their love for the education they received."</p>
<p>Individual alumni can donate money to the fund, or groups of alumni can pool their resources to name individual honorees. These funds will be channeled into the Pioneer Arts endowment.</p>
<p>For more information, contact Lesley Brander at <a href="mailto:lbrander@ucsc.edu">lbrander@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Zajac, McClellan, and Weygandt are still making art, still in regular contact, and still in Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>&#8220;We respect each other as artists, and we&#8217;re not in competition,&#8221; McClellan explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s like the Mafia. We don&#8217;t mess with each other&#8217;s territory.&#8221;</p>
<p>McClellan made&#8212;and still makes&#8212;art boxes that combine wildly disparate elements: lentil-shaped doll&#8217;s eyes, El Greco figures, Hubble space imagery, Day of the Dead skulls, insects, house-hold tools, Eadweard J. Muybridge&#8217;s kinetic photos&#8212;and makes them work together. In one of his &#8220;Wow Boxes,&#8221; viewers peer through a spy hole and get pulled into a dreamscape of leaning towers and endless M. C. Escher corridors.</p>
<p>Weygandt continues to make highly regarded monoprints. Like one of his many inspirations, the Italian painter Giorgio Morandi, he uses unassuming forms&#8212;vases, pots, and pitchers&#8212;and finds infinite variations of form, texture, light, and color.</p>
<p>Zajac, like the others, is disarmingly humble, so it takes some digging to find out that he is a Guggenheim Fellowship recipient, and that his work is part of the holdings of the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art, among many others. &#8220;They keep my work in a place of honor,&#8221; he said, in regard to MOMA. &#8220;It&#8217;s down in the basement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zajac speaks of his UCSC colleagues with the same admiration that he bestows on far more famous artists. At his home, the work of Hardy Hanson and Weygandt hang side by side with the work of Giacometti and Morandi, and he calls McClellan &#8220;the Duchamp of our time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly the three understand each other&#8217;s overlaps and differences.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack is a refiner,&#8221; McClellan said. &#8220;His work depends on exactness, the finish, the clarity. Don is all about re-working. I&#8217;m more of a fumbler.</p>
<p>As different as they are, the three have striking commonalities. McClellan and Weygandt both served in World War II&#8212;though not together, and they did not face combat.</p>
<p>McClellan often lunches with Zajac. McClellan and Weygandt have a longstanding bocce rivalry. All have worked a number of odd jobs on their way to becoming artists, though Zajac has the most distinction in that regard, having served as a painter of grocery store window advertisements, a fisherman, a caller at a bingo parlor, and the house fiddler at a coffee shop.</p>
<p>McClellan and Zajac have known each other off and on since they were young men. The three men also share a trait common to artists; when it comes to inspiration and career paths, there is no such thing as a straight line. Their friendships and long careers are the result of false starts, unexpected changes, snap decisions, and coincidences. The only constant in their lives, their teaching, and their adventures is perseverance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Life will lead you where it will,&#8221; Weygandt said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d0b90de580727046005a880363aca6c3"><name>review-fall-2010-eden</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Restoring an altered Eden</title><summary>A UCSC professor fosters a happy marriage between academic rigor and on-the-ground conservation to protect and renew an estuarine gem.&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p>ELKHORN SLOUGH&#8212;As Kerstin Wasson stands at the edge of the rising tide lapping gradually higher, her slight frame bubbles with enthusiasm and guarded optimism for the sprawling salt marsh around her.</p>
<p>"It sends shivers up my spine sometimes as I'm walking around these mudflats on Elkhorn Slough holding an oyster in my hands," says Wasson, an adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz. "There have been humans standing in these places holding oysters in their hands for 7,000 to 8,000 years."</p>
<p>It's true. Wasson and her colleagues know that, millennia ago, Native Americans feasted on the petite Olympia oyster from Elkhorn Slough. The former human residents' trash piles, known as middens to archeologists, are still around today, replete with bits of the faded half dollar-sized shells.</p>
<p>Then, in the 1920s, oyster fishermen from San Francisco Bay trekked down the coast to Elkhorn Slough, located east of Moss Landing. According to the records, they cleaned out the area in a few weeks, harvesting Olympia oysters by the bushel. U.S. Fish and Game biologists surveying the area just a short time later would struggle to find a single oyster. So for decades, it was assumed that the West Coast's only native oyster was gone from the slough for good. But about 10 years ago, a few oysters were discovered here.</p>
<p>When Wasson became research coordinator at the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in 2000, the oysters were ideal subjects for the type of conservation research, grounded in ecological theory, that Wasson wanted to develop in her new role. With one foot in academia as a UCSC professor and another in applied restoration and conservation as a member of the reserve staff, Wasson bridges these two worlds, with each benefiting from the close connection.</p>
<div class="callout-right"><img alt="Elkhorn Slough" height="151" src="images/eden-slough-350.jpg" width="350"/></div>
<p>A bustling harbor nearby, intensive agriculture seemingly surrounding every one of its myriad spindly fingers, and a behemoth power plant looming large at its entrance, the slough is beset by a bevy of human impacts. Like estuaries everywhere, which are "some of the most altered ecosystems on earth," Wasson says, Elkhorn Slough sits surrounded by fertile farmland, near a harbor offering boats protection from the open ocean, and has the relatively still water needed for power plant intake pipes.</p>
<p>But a walk with Wasson and her students makes the recovery of this marshy Eden feel possible. In seemingly every direction, they point out ongoing research intended to increase our knowledge of how the estuarine ecosystem functions, what effects we're having on it as humans, and what can be done to restore the slough to a more natural state.</p>
<p>Preliminary study of the Olympia oyster showed that, while a few were holding on (literally and figuratively) to any hard surface they could find, their numbers were still dangerously low&#8212;by Wasson's calculations, only about 500 live in the entire reserve. Even absent the pressure of commercial harvesting, their numbers didn't seem to be rebounding. But things had changed since the days when Native Americans sustainably cultivated the oysters for centuries. The sediment and pollution caused by intensive agriculture and other human activities that have become the norm pose serious problems for filter-feeding oysters.</p>
<p>Operating on the hypothesis that the oysters needed more solid footing, Wasson and her team built oyster reefs, embedding hand-sized native clam shells in one-foot by two-foot block rectangles of concrete. Wasson and newly minted UCSC Ph.D. Rikke Preisler designed these reefs to be "modular and mobile" and placed them at varying depths in the slough.</p>
<p>"It's a general question in conservation biology: If we build it, will they come?" Preisler says.</p>
<p>The hope is they'll learn where best to locate the reefs and more about the effects of pollution, high nutrient loads, and silt on the oysters' recovery, while also accomplishing the conservation goal of doubling the number of oysters in the reserve to 1,000.</p>
<h2><strong>A productive partnership</strong></h2>
<p>Wasson relishes the relationship with UCSC, because each master's or doctoral thesis adds new pieces to this complex puzzle. "That's the gold standard of un&#173;derstanding ecological processes, having those thorough, in-depth, years of fo&#173;cused study," she adds. "No matter what, we always learn something that ends up being relevant for conservation."</p>
<p>Preisler's doctoral work began at the slough when she noticed how many non-native green crabs had taken up residence. She took on what Wasson calls an "ambi&#173;tious biogeographic analysis" of the green crab, examining their numbers, not just in the slough and other invaded sites on the West Coast, but also at three sites each in the eastern United States and in the green crab's native Europe. Incidentally, green crabs like to dine on small oysters, so exploring whether an exploding crab population might drag down oyster num&#173;bers was an interesting corollary to the abundance issue.</p>
<p>What Preisler found was surpris&#173;ing. While Elkhorn Slough and San Francisco Bay certainly have a lot of green crabs, they were much more abundant on the East Coast and in their native range. And in a later year of her study, Preisler noticed a dip in the population, suggesting that the situation might not be totally out of control.</p>
<p>"This is not to say, well, we have so few, we shouldn't be concerned about them," she warns. But this is the type of work that can be used directly by managers and policy makers, Wasson says. For example, based on this study, they might conclude that it's better to eradicate a species that definitely is causing environmental problems. "This is where the slough is really valuable, because you can think of an interesting project &#8230; and you actually have the op&#173;portunity to use the reserve to carry out your experiments," Preisler adds. The com&#173;bination of academics and conservation is, in her words, "a happy marriage."</p>
<h2><strong>Save the world with science</strong> <strong>&#160;</strong></h2>
<p>With a goal of bolstering shorter-term projects like Preisler's with the long-term data that makes them possible, Elkhorn Slough was one of the first National Estuarine Research Reserves&#8212; a network similar to the National Park System, but for estuaries, Wasson says. The National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration oversees the network, and each reserve is run by a state partner&#8212;that's the California Department of Fish and Game at Elkhorn Slough.</p>
<p>Nearly 30 years after the reserve desig&#173;nation, the nonprofit Elkhorn Slough Foundation, which works closely with the reserve, has become the largest landowner in the watershed, and about 90 percent of land that touches the estuary is managed for conservation in some way. Evidence of that focus abounds: Fields up-slope of the slough, owned by the foundation and leased to farmers, boast avocado trees and rosemary bushes, which need less water and fewer fertilizers than crops more typi&#173;cally associated with this region such as strawberries. And 25 water-quality moni&#173;toring stations dot the slough and waters nearby, some taking measurements every 15 minutes and transmitting them via sat&#173;ellite to publically accessible web pages.</p>
<p>Data from those stations stretching back 20 years will help Brent Hughes as he begins his doctoral research at UCSC in September. As an ecologist at the reserve for the past two years, he's grown curious about fertilizer runoff from agricultural fields upstream and its influence on the estuarine environment. Hughes explains that the cold water stirred up from the depths of Monterey Canyon offshore, which makes its way into the slough, is brimming with nutrients, with some of the highest naturally occurring nitrate levels in the world.</p>
<p>"That's super nutrient-rich water," Hughes says, and it's the reason Monterey Bay is such a fecund area for plants and wildlife. But those nitrate levels are dwarfed by the ones recorded adjacent to the slough at the old Salinas River chan&#173;nel monitoring station, sometimes 300 to 400 times higher, owing mostly to the massive farms that line the waterway.</p>
<p>But what are the quantifiable conse&#173;quences to the slough's ecosystem? Hughes will delve into that question in the com&#173;ing years. He knows more nutrients often translate into burgeoning algal popula&#173;tions. Pointing to sheets of translucent green sea lettuce the size and shape of dinner plates that form thick mats on the water's surface, he explains that out on the coast, this algae is decidedly underachiev&#173;ing, its abundance kept down by com&#173;petition with more robust species. In the slough, though, it seems to have gone viral.</p>
<p>"Here, maybe it should be an inferior species, but it completely changes the en&#173;tire system," he adds. At night, the algae suck precious oxygen from the system. When the sea lettuce washes ashore, it putrefies into a gunky mess that fosters the growth of microbes that further deplete oxygen levels and create an in&#173;hospitable environment for struggling species like the Olympia oysters.</p>
<p>Hughes plans to track the nutrient inputs that pervade the estuary from their sources by looking at their unique chemical sig&#173;natures. And he'll survey the multitude of tiny invertebrates that evade the gaze of most visitors but are so critical to its health. He notes the UC Cooperative Extension already works with farmers to find the Goldilocks amount of fertilizer to apply to their crops&#8212;enough to make their fields productive, but not so much that it causes environmental prob&#173;lems. Hughes's work could help land man&#173;agers and farmers further home in on that happy medium.</p>
<p>Wasson sees that drive to see their work applied to a problem in many of the stu&#173;dents she advises at the reserve. "There's this excitement about having your re&#173;search translate to something that affects management on the ground or regional policy," she says.</p>

But to the thou&#173;sands of Chinese immigrants who were detained there for weeks and months to undergo harsh examinations, and to ap&#173;peal exclusion decisions, Angel Island was nothing more than a prison.</p>
<p><em>This place is called an island of im</em><em>&#173;</em><em>mortals,</em></p>
<p><em>When, in fact, this moun</em><em>&#173;</em><em>tain wilderness is a prison.</em></p>
<p><em>Once you see the open net, why throw yourself in?</em></p>
<p><em>It is only because of empty pockets I can do nothing else.</em></p>
<p>This Chinese poem that was found carved into the immigration barrack walls remind us that unlike Ellis Island, which restricted but did not exclude European immigrants to this country, Angel Island was built spe&#173;cifically to enforce the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, to keep Chinese laborers out of the country. The first racial group to be excluded by U.S. law, Chinese like my own father, Tom Yip Jing, were the first "illegal immigrants." To circumvent the exclusion laws, he assumed a false identity. Once admitted into the country, my father had to live a life of deceit and duplicity, under constant fear of deportation.</p>
<p>Today, immigration is still a complicated and contentious matter, as we debate over who to let in and who to keep out, and what to do with the 11 million undocu&#173;mented immigrants in the country. Last April, Arizona passed the toughest immi&#173;gration law in decades, authorizing local police to arrest and detain suspected "il&#173;legal immigrants" and requiring aliens to carry immigration documents with them at all times.</p>
<p>How does this anti-immigrant trend jibe with the popular view of America as a "nation of immigrants" that welcomes "the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free?" The Angel Island story tells us that the United States has always had a complicated relationship with immigration, including some and ex&#173;cluding others. While many Asian immi&#173;grants were denied entry at Angel Island because of race- and class-biased exclusion laws, thousands of newcomers from Asian, European, and Latin American countries were admitted, allowed to settle and even&#173;tually become U.S. citizens. Like other immigrants before them, they went on to help make America the powerful and rich country it is today.</p>
<p>In 1965, Congress passed new immigra&#173;tion legislation that put every race and nation on an equal footing. However, years of lax enforcement of our immigra&#173;tion laws, backlogs and bureaucracy, and inadequate work visas to meet the needs of a global economy have resulted in a vast population of undocumented immi&#173;grants, all forced to live in the shadows.</p>
<p>As we commemorate the 100th anni&#173;versary of the Angel Island Immigration Station, let us remember its multira&#173;cial history of inclusion and exclusion. Discriminatory and unfair immigration laws have harsh and deep repercussions on the lives of people. Conversely, fair immigration policies that uphold our val&#173;ues as a nation of immigrants have led to beneficial gains for the entire society.</p>
<p>More than ever before, our country needs comprehensive immigration reform that will secure our borders, benefit our econ&#173;omy, and provide a pathway to respon&#173;sible citizenship for those undocumented immigrants who deserve it.</p>

Even then she was a tinkerer, redesigning the dress by lowering the garment&#8217;s back and re-creating its top before wearing it.</p>
<p>Three years later, when she traveled the world during her junior year at UC Santa Cruz with Semester at Sea, a shipboard program for global study abroad,clothing became much more than a diversionary pastime.</p>
<p>&#8220;In each country I just found the clothes to be such an amazing expression of people, of time and culture and place, not just fashion or trendiness,&#8221; said White, 29. &#8220;From an outsider&#8217;s perspective, it&#8217;s storytelling. I had an &#8216;a ha&#8217; moment with a beautiful mix of psychology, which is analyzing character, and clothing, which I&#8217;ve always had a passion for.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p>White is now a costumer for one of the hottest shows on television&#8212;AMC&#8217;s Mad Men, set in 1960s New York, starting at the fictional Sterling Cooper advertising agency on Madison Avenue and later at the fledgling firm of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.</p>
<p>The show centers on Don Draper, played by Jon Hamm, creative director at Sterling Cooper and a founding partner at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Through the characters&#8217; experiences, both in and out of the office, the show depicts the changing social values, fashions, and politics of 1960s America.</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s an appreciation of style. We want to look like that even if we don&#8217;t want to wear it.&#8221;</blockquote>
<em>&#8212;Mary McNamara,</em> Los Angeles Times <em>TV critic</em></div>
<p>In its fourth season, which began in July, the show is set in 1965&#8212;the year UC Santa Cruz was founded. The country was on the brink of enormous social change.</p>
<p>&#8220;So much was changing,&#8221; said Los Angeles Times TV critic Mary McNamara. She referenced the deepening Vietnam War, &#8220;hippie stuff,&#8221; and the sexual revolution, &#8220;but as much as those changed things, it&#8217;s almost the more subtle cultural shifts that make us realize when we see the &#8216;before&#8217; how different the &#8216;after&#8217; is,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>For example, the sexism, racism, classism, cigarette smoking, emotional repression, and rampant boozing in the office portrayed on the show are shocking to today&#8217;s audiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty astonishing that we&#8217;ve gone from a nation where you had a three-martini lunch, to where if you do that now people are going to be leaving AA literature on your desk,&#8221; McNamara said.</p>
<h2>Background is her forte</h2>
<p>White outfits the female background characters, or, in the lingo, &#8220;BG women.&#8221; Any non-speaking female character in the background&#8212;in the office, a restaurant, bar, doctor&#8217;s office, or hotel lobby&#8212;is her charge.</p>
<p>On fitting days, &#8220;each girl comes in and I fit her top to bottom with stockings, pantyhose, panties, girdles, bras, everything,&#8221; White said.</p>
<p>That attention to detail, down to the undergarments, helps transport television viewers through time, said Brandin Bar&#243;n, associate professor in theater arts at UCSC, who specializes in costume design.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we become more casual in society, women are not used to wearing heavy foundation garments such as they do on Mad Men because it&#8217;s not part of our lifestyle,&#8221; Bar&#243;n said.</p>
<p>White then gives <em>Mad Men</em> costume designer Janie Bryant two outfit options for each character.</p>
<p>&#8220;We treat all the backgrounds as if they&#8217;re principals,&#8221; said White. &#8220;I try to make characters out of people. I look at her and think, &#8216;Is she a mom? A grandmother? Does she have a lot of money?&#8217; I think that&#8217;s a reason people do respond to the show, because they notice people feel really real in a scene and that they have a story.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Buzz generator</h2>
<p><em>Mad Men</em> has received critical acclaim, particularly for its historical authenticity and visual style, and has won 13 Emmys and 4 Golden Globes. The show is meticulously researched, with almost maniacal attention to detail and historical accuracy in every frame&#8212;from the bottle openers to the vernacular to the lamp on the side table in Don Draper&#8217;s bachelor pad.</p>
<p>&#8220;I credit [<em>Mad Men</em> creator] Matthew Weiner and AMC for not scrimping on sets and costume and realizing that God is in the details,&#8221; said McNamara.</p>
<p>Every detail serves a narrative function. The main characters&#8217; clothing&#8212;tailored suits and pressed white shirts for the men, girdles and waist-conscious dresses and skirts for the women&#8212;is polished, sleek, fitted and perfect, serving as a contrast to the messiness of their lives and psyches.</p>
<p>Amazingly, almost all of the clothing on the show is actually from the 1960s, even the shoes, White said. There are a few exceptions, such as pantyhose and costumes designed specially by Bryant.</p>
<p>Viewers have noticed. The buzz around the show is almost a roar, and media and cross-marketing blitzes are everywhere&#8212; the September 16 issue of Rolling Stone magazine featured a sexy shot of four main characters on the cover and pronounced <em>Mad Men</em> &#8220;the best show on TV,&#8221; while a large clothing retailer teamed with the show to offer a casting call that ended in September. As of early September, there were more than 4,500 entries. <em>Vogue, Cosmopolitan, Marie Claire,</em> and <em>Women&#8217;s Wear Daily</em> have published Mad Men fashion articles. Bryant is coming out with her own &#8217;60s inspired line called Mod. There are even Mad Men Barbie dolls.</p>
<p>When the pilot episode aired in 2007, &#8220;we were all struck with the beauty of it&#8212;the cinematography, the costumes, the set. It was evocative of a dreamlike interpretation of the &#8217;50s and &#8217;60s, where men looked like men and women looked like women,&#8221; McNamara said. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s an appreciation of style. We want to look like that even if we don&#8217;t want to wear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>For White, working with &#8217;60s clothing has provided a unique perspective on an era that ended long before she was born.</p>
<p>&#8220;In school we always thought of the &#8217;60s as a time of cultural revolution, but from where we&#8217;re working you can see why people started to go that way,&#8221; White said. &#8220;Just dealing in clothing, it&#8217;s so strict, and there are so many etiquette rules&#8212;when to wear gloves, when to wear a hat&#8212;I can see why people wanted to break free of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nowadays, it&#8217;s easy to glamorize the dressy style of the time, she added, &#8220;but if you had to wear a girdle every day it would not be so glamorous and you&#8217;d be ready to burn it.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Road to costuming</h2>
<p>White&#8217;s journey to costume work for major television productions&#8212;she also works on HBO&#8217;s <em>True Blood</em>&#8212;is a story about persistence and a little bit of &#8220;right time, right place.&#8221;</p>
<p>After Semester at Sea, she took some costume-design-related classes at UCSC, as well as figure drawing and sewing.</p>
<p>At UCSC, she also learned to take on the world with a laid-back attitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can look at the other side of things and not be judgmental,&#8221; said White, who lives in Los Angeles with her husband, James Stanton (College Nine &#8217;04, community studies), a freelance TV and film editor. UCSC is something of a family affair: Stanton&#8217;s mother, Marti Stanton, works at UCSC as manager of the American studies department.</p>
<p>After college, White got a degree in fashion design from the Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising in Los Angeles. She then landed a job as a shopper for the entertainment division at Disneyland.</p>
<p>She had made contact with Bryant earlier, and made sure to keep in touch with an e-mail every few months. Shortly after White left Disneyland, she got a call from Bryant asking if she&#8217;d like to join her in a new show on AMC.</p>
<p>Her days for <em>Mad Men</em> are filled with tasks including &#8220;pulling&#8221; vintage clothing from Los Angeles-area costume houses, where she&#8217;ll rent two or three racks&#8217; worth of period clothing for a scene.</p>
<p>Then she fits the actors and works on set to make sure the costumes are &#8220;100 percent correct on every single person every single time&#8221;&#8212;snaps are snapped, hook-and-eyes are fastened, buttons are in the proper place, bows are tied.</p>
<p>When she&#8217;s not pulling, fitting, or on set, she&#8217;s searching through magazines from the 1960s such as <em>Good Housekeeping</em> and <em>Vogue</em>, as well as Sears and Montgomery Ward catalogs. She also scans web sites such as visual media provider Corbis Images and watches movies from the time period.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do research and a lot of it, all the time,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You start to see different silhouettes&#8212;no matter the print or the pattern, you see where the seam lines are, and I can recognize it&#8217;s the proper silhouette.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1965, the civil rights movement and the feminist movement were making huge inroads. Record numbers of people who had attained a college education courtesy of the post-World War II GI Bill were working to change American society.</p>
<p><em>Mad Men</em> offers a measuring stick for how far we&#8217;ve come, said critic McNamara.</p>
<p>By our current thinking, &#8220;everyone deserves an equal chance, smoking is bad for you, you need to be able to talk about your feelings, and you need to find some kind of inner happiness&#8212;no matter how good you look in a suit.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the show roots viewers in a time period before these beliefs had caught on.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Mad Men</em> has done a good job of presenting a fascinating and beautifully put together &#8216;before&#8217; picture,&#8221; McNamara said, &#8220;and that&#8217;s more effective than any kind of chronicling of the actual change.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d131f91480727046005a88032d55d576"><name>review-fall-2010-easter-eggs</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>45th anniversary info-nuggets--fall 2010 UCSC Review</title><summary>In honor of UCSC's 45th anniversary, we've assembled 45 info-nuggets of campus history, discoveries, milestones, and oddities.

THE SHOW</p>
<p>Co-produced by Tandy Beal &amp; Company and the UCSC Theater Arts Department, and directed by Tandy Beal herself, 'Mixed Nutz!' is a fun-filled, energetic extravaganza that gives a tip of the hat--and the juggling pin!--to the traditional Nutcracker, while featuring dancers, circus artists, gymnasts, and vocalists all representing a world of cultures.<br/>
<br/>
'Mixed Nutz!' playfully maintains the true spirit and basic story of the traditional Nutcracker: festively dressed party-goers enter for an evening of holiday merriment, young Clara receives a toy nutcracker as a special gift, and magic begins to unfold--with entertaining side trips in Candyland, a visit by the Sugar Plum Fairy, a Waltz of the Flowers, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
Over 30 dancers and circus artists perform acts of beauty, comedy and skill while Tchaikovsky&#8217;s glorious music is sung--a cappella--by the Bay Area&#8217;s multi-talented vocal group, SoVoS&#243; (&#8220;Soul&#8230;Voice&#8230;Song&#8221;) with Santa Cruz-based vocalist Lori Rivera, who returns this year to lend her substantial vocal talent to the show.<br/>
<br/>
The <em>Santa Cruz Sentinel</em> calls 'Mixed Nutz!' &#8220;the ideal holiday experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>THE ARTISTS (Who&#8217;s back and who&#8217;s new this season)</p>
<p>In addition to beautiful, flowing dance pieces and amazing a cappella vocal music by SoVoS&#243;, 'Mixed Nutz!' features a cast of world-class performing artists--some of whom are making their 'Mixed Nutz!' debut this holiday.<br/>
<br/>
Chinese footbalancer and acrobat Wang Hong returns to wow audiences with her grace and skill&#8230; hand-to-hand balancing is new this year with a remarkable act by Jennings McCown and Chinese acrobat Xiao Hong Weng&#8230; Kerri Kresinski joins the show for two weekends with her stunning aerial silk performance, and aerial hoop artist Sylphie Currin is back to dazzle us from great heights&#8230; circus artists Iman Lizarazu, Saki, and Jan Damm were audience favorites last season, and they are joined by newcomer Jasper Patterson of the New Eccentrics. We also welcome back Mexican folklorico dancers from Watsonville&#8217;s Corazon en Flor and UCSC&#8217;s Los Mejicas, plus hip-hoppers, local gymnasts, and dancers from the UCSC Theater Arts Department.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

(Photograph by Larry Travis/www.raincoast.org)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A group of conservation biologists led by a researcher from UC Santa Cruz and Canada&#8217;s Raincoast Conservation Foundation has proposed limiting the fishing of Pacific salmon off British Columbia in order to improve the ecosystems of protected coastal areas where spawning occurs and help coastal economies.</p>
<p>The proposal is published in the journal <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-263X.2010.00145.x/full"><em>Conservation Letters</em></a>. &#160;</p>
<p>The idea is to limit fishing to allow more salmon to migrate to their native streams to spawn, said Chris Darimont, Raincoast scientist and a post doctoral researcher in the environmental studies department at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</p>
<p>"Taking less might mean more benefits to ecosystems and humans," Darimont said.</p>
<p>More spawning salmon will mean two things: greater benefits to a wide variety of wildlife that use salmon and increased economic opportunities that value salmon more alive than dead, Darimont said.</p>
<p>Darimont, the paper's lead author is joined by Chris Wilmers, assistant professor of environmental studies at UCSC, and researchers from the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, UC Berkeley, University of Calgary and Simon Fraser University.</p>
<p>Darimont explained that decades of fisheries exploitation, habitat change and other human-caused harms have had a tremendous impact on salmon and the terrestrial ecosystems where they spawn &#8211; even in protected areas. Restoring salmon to these areas would mean increased food for more than 100 species in the food web - species for which in many cases protected areas were created.&#160; Even plants and trees along the spawning channels would see greater benefit from more of the fishy "fertilizer."</p>
<p>The researchers propose reductions in fishing that start with pink and chum salmon because the impact on commercial fishing wouldn't be as great as it would be with the more valuable sockeye, Chinook and coho salmon.</p>
<p>The authors admit that policy makers in the U.S. and Canada might regard their proposal as radical but they argue that it has the potential to yield economic and management benefits.</p>
<p>&#8216;Allowing salmon to evade fishing nets has the potential to support a more diverse salmon industry," said Wilmers. "A case in point is the salmon-reliant ecotourism. Eeach year, thousands of people come to watch grizzly bears, eagles, and the salmon themselves," Wilmers said.</p>
<p>Researchers began with the question: &#160;Are protected areas on land that host highly exploited salmon runs, such as state and national parks and ecological reserves, truly protected?</p>
<p>Darimont said the proposal is consistent with a new Canadian federal government policy &#8211; the "Wild Salmon Policy" &#8211; that explicitly recognizes that non-human users of salmon &#8211; including those on land and in fresh water streams &#8211; ought to be considered in fisheries management.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.raincoast.org/</url><title>Raincoast Conservation Foundation</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291755-263X</url><title>Conservation Letters</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e45d7af380727046005a88039ac56e05"><name>inductees</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Four faculty members inducted into American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences</title><summary>Four UCSC faculty members were inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences at a ceremony on October 9.</summary><keywords>Michael Dine, Gary Glatzmaier, Susan Strome, John Thompson, American Academy of Arts and Sciences</keywords><start-date>1287993600000</start-date><display-name>Four faculty members inducted into American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences</display-name><path>/2010/10/inductees</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/10/inductees</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1288026552966</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1288026645160</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value><value>Physics</value><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/inductees.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/inductees.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>inductees.jpg</name><display-name>inductees.jpg</display-name><file-size>94585</file-size><width>540</width><height>386</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Inductees signed the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Book of Members, a tradition dating back to 1780.

<p>Ocean environmentalist and filmmaker Jean-Michel Cousteau shared first-hand reports and startling footage of the Deepwater Horizon explosion and BP oil spill during his multimedia presentation at Friday's UCSC Foundation Forum, which drew 300 people.</p>
<p>But Cousteau, son of famed ocean explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau, who died in 1997, managed to make his "Report from the Gulf" uplifting instead of depressing.</p>
<p>"I am more optimistic than I've ever been," said Cousteau, honored last week with UCSC's Foundation Medal. "I am convinced we can change, and that the oil spill was the huge kick in the butt that we needed to change."</p>
<p>Cousteau, who has visited the gulf several times, and plans to return to finish an hour-long documentary about the spill's aftermath, tailored his message to the 120 middle and high school students who showed up to the event at downtown Santa Cruz's Rittenhouse Building.</p>
<p>The French-born Cousteau reminded these young people that his big, life-transforming moment happened when he was only a boy, trying out the scuba gear that his father helped to invent, and setting out to see the world in Captain Cousteau's marine vessels.</p>
<p>It was more of an education than any teacher could have given him.</p>
<p>Cousteau channeled the mischievous school kid he used to be when he talked about playing hooky with his brother to go sailing at sea--with his father's full consent and approval.</p>
<p>"My dad felt that being in the environment--seeing, touching, smelling--was much more important than being in jail at school," Cousteau said, drawing scattered chuckles from the youngsters in the crowd.</p>
<p>Emboldened by his youth-friendly presentation, young students dominated the Q and A session with incisive questions and observations.</p>
<p>"If we already have all this alternative energy technology, why aren't we using it?" said Kelly McCandless, 11, to loud applause. McCandless is part of the Santa Cruz City Schools Alternative Family Education (AFE) program, a home study school provided for kindergarten through 12th grade students.</p>
<p>Cousteau urged McCandless to "go out and kick some [rear ends]" to make the adult world embrace more renewable energy sources, including an algae-based fuel for ships and planes.</p>
<p>Other students wanted to know more about the circumstances that led up to the oil spill.</p>
<p>"Why did we resort to using oil in the first place?" said Joshua Lovell, 10, who traveled from Stockton to watch the presentation, and who later conversed at some length with Cousteau.</p>
<p>Cousteau shared the stage with award-winning NPR science correspondent Richard Harris (Crown '80), recipient of this year's UCSC Alumni Achievement Award. Harris set the stage for Cousteau's speech by providing some context and background for the disaster. Intense demand for fossil fuels has driven oil companies into deeper water than ever, Harris said. BP drilled 5,000 feet down--through nearly a mile of water.</p>
<p>"That's hard to fathom, pardon the pun," Harris said.</p>
<p>On April 20, a methane-gas explosion, which killed 11 workers, set off the massive leak, which amounted to nearly 5 million barrels of crude oil, far exceeding the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound.</p>
<p>Harris was among the doubters when BP argued, in the early stages, that about 5,000 gallons' worth of crude was spilling into the gulf daily. He assembled a team of experts--an astrophysicist, a nanotechnology expert who studies the flow of fluid through pipes, and a marine biologist studying underwater thermal vents. "Lo and behold--all three said that 50,000 to 75,000 barrels a day were coming out."</p>
<p>Harris mentioned that the spill, as vast as it was, only amounted to five hours' worth of power for America's millions of trucks and cars.</p>
<p>Many audience members wanted to know exactly how bad the spill really was. How many creatures perished? What could happen next?</p>
<p>Cousteau and Harris warned that its full impact has not yet been revealed. Cousteau talked about dolphins having to give birth and breast-feed in the oily environment, the impact on creatures vital to the food chain, and the tens of thousands of people who make their living in the gulf.</p>
<p>Cousteau heads the <a href="http://www.oceanfutures.org/">Ocean Futures Society</a>, a nonprofit marine conservation and education organization, which he founded in 1999 to build on the work of his famous father, whose 100<sup>th</sup> birthday is this year.</p>
<p>The organization is based in Santa Barbara--"where I picked up this accent," Cousteau said, with a mischievous expression.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e56351a380727046005a88036b3a7516"><name>ucsc-in-the-news-10-25-10</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>News that literature professor Karen Tei Yamashita was nominated for a 2010 National Book Award was reported in media across the country, including the San Francisco Chronicle, Los Angeles Times, New York Times, Minnesota Public Radio, Washington Post, and Santa Cruz Sentinel.</summary><start-date>1287993600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News</display-name><path>/2010/10/ucsc-in-the-news-10-25-10</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/10/ucsc-in-the-news-10-25-10</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1288043712822</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1289348457850</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>News that literature professor Karen Tei Yamashita was nominated for a 2010 National Book Award was reported in media across the country, including the <em><strong>San Francisco Chronicle, Los Angeles Times, New York Times, Minnesota Public Radio, Washington Post,</strong></em> and<strong>&#160;</strong><em><strong>Santa Cruz Sentinel.</strong></em></p>

<br/>
</span></span> <span></span></p>
<p><span>Significant changes for 2011 include the following:</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Please be aware that due to rising medical plan costs UC is making major changes in medical plans, with premiums for some plans increasing substantially.&#160; Two new medical plans (Health Net Blue &amp; Gold HMO and Anthem Lumenos PPO with HRA) are being introduced as value-priced alternatives for next year.&#160; Providers used by many UCSC employees under the current Health Net HMO are not available under the lower priced Blue &amp; Gold HMO.&#160; For an overview of these changes, please see the <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/memo_10-11-10.htm">Preview of New Medical Plans for 2011</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Your children up to age 26 are eligible for UC insurance plans that provide coverage to children (subject to collective bargaining).&#160;</span> If your children reached or will reach the age of 23 at any time in 2010, you must re-enroll them during Open Enrollment.&#160; UC will not re-enroll them or continue their coverage automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Health Flexible Spending Account funds may no longer be used for over-the-counter medicines such as aspirin, cold medicine, cough drops, etc. unless you have a prescription for that medication.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are a represented employee, medical plan contributions and certain eligibility changes that are not mandated by federal law may be subject to collective bargaining negotiations.&#160; However, plan changes must still be made during Open Enrollment.&#160; Please see <a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/open_enrollment/employees/e_bargaining_units.html">Information for Represented Employees</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Open Enrollment booklets were mailed to your home last week.&#160; You can find a copy of this booklet and full details of all plan changes on the Open Enrollment website, available on <a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/open_enrollment/index.html">At Your Service</a> (atyourservice.ucop.edu<span>/</span>open_enrollment).&#160; The site includes information about UC&#8217;s health and welfare plans, eligibility for coverage, summaries of plan changes, medical plan costs, and much more.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have questions or need assistance with your enrollment decisions, consider attending an Open Enrollment presentation or participating in a drop-in Help Desk/Open Lab session.&#160; The drop-in sessions are held in the computer lab and assistance will be available to make your changes online.&#160; Schedules may be found on the <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/open_enrollment_2011.htm">UCSC Open Enrollment</a> website.&#160; For individual assistance, please contact the campus Benefits Office at (831) 459-2013.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>We fully recognize that this year presents <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/10/open-enrollment-monday-oct-25.html">special challenges for our campus</a> and that the changes in medical plans present difficult choices for a large number of UCSC employees.&#160; For those who elect to change their healthcare provider, the campus is dedicated to supporting you in making that change.&#160; Please refer to the <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/open_enrollment_2011.htm">UCSC Open Enrollment</a> website for helpful information.&#160; We strongly encourage you to use the above resources to become fully informed and to proceed with making your Open Enrollment decisions.</span> <span><br/>

<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>(Encargados de la unidad: Favor de imprimir una copia de este mensaje y todos los materiales relacionados para las personas en su &#225;rea que no tienen acceso regular a una computadora.)</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>El per&#237;odo de inscripci&#243;n abierta anual comienza hoy (lunes 25 de octubre) y termina a las 5:00 el martes, 23 de noviembre. &#201;ste es el tiempo del el a&#241;o para repasar los beneficios de salud y bienestar y decidir si necesita realizar alg&#250;n cambio. A diferencia de los &#250;ltimos a&#241;os cuando hab&#237;a cambios relativamente de menor importancia a las opciones del plan, los cambios del plan para el pr&#243;ximo a&#241;o son significativos y presentan varios puntos de decisi&#243;n importantes. Favor de revisar la declaraci&#243;n de beneficios cuidadosamente para estar completamente informado con cualquier acci&#243;n requerida por su parte cuando ajuste sus selecciones.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Cambios significativos para 2011 incluyen los siguientes:</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<ul>

<p>The resolutions were passed by "voice vote."</p>
<p><strong>Resolution on New Tier Post Employment Benefits</strong></p>
<p><em>Whereas;&#160;</em>a reliable plan providing adequate post-retirement income and health care for employees, with a sufficient employer contribution toward its cost, is critical for the continued excellence of the University of California, and</p>
<p><em>Whereas;</em>&#160;the integrated pension plans, Options A and B, proposed by the Post-Employment Benefits Task Force, are complex, opaque, and inequitable unlike the flat (or uniform) structure of the current UC pension plan and the proposed Option C, which makes retirement planning easy, certain, equitable, and low risk; and</p>
<p><em>Whereas;</em>&#160;the linkage with social security in integrated pension plans will result in pension age factors (for a fixed salary) decreasing with time, and are liable to result in a steady deterioration of faculty pensions unless there are large and continuing increases in the faculty salary scales, commensurate with the increases in social security covered compensation;</p>
<p>THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Santa Cruz Division of the Academic Senate calls on President Yudof to reject any variant of an integrated pension plan and retain the existing flat/uniform plan structure of the current UC pension plan, and</p>
<p>BE IT RESOLVED that the Santa Cruz Division calls on President Yudof to assure an employer contribution of at least 9.0% toward the estimated long-term normal cost of the pension plan, and</p>
<p>BE IT RESOLVED that the Santa Cruz Division calls on President Yudof to decide on employee contribution only after consultation with all employee groups.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution on contributions from current employees who continue with the current UCRP plan</strong></p>
<p><em>Whereas;</em>&#160; raising employee contributions above 7% fundamentally alters the terms of the current UCRP pension plan and has the effect of making the total remuneration highly uncompetitive for current employees;</p>
<p>THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Santa Cruz Division of the Academic Senate calls on President Yudof to recommend that the employee contributions not exceed 7% for employees who continue in the current UCRP plan.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution on Retiree Health Benefits</strong></p>
<p><em>Whereas;</em>&#160;provision of adequate health care benefits following a full career is viewed as a critical aspect of the total compensation package that has made the University&#160;of California the preeminent institution that it is today;&#160;and</p>
<p><em>Whereas;</em>&#160;the retiree health insurance recommendations of the Post-Employment Benefits Task Force do not inform current and future retirees of the magnitude of likely future contributions; and</p>
<p><em>Whereas;</em>&#160;it appears that all current and future retirees are likely to face huge increases in health insurance premiums, further eroding their pension benefits;</p>
<p>THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Santa Cruz Division of the Academic Senate calls on President Yudof to immediately inform retirees and active employees about the size of the increased premiums for all health plans with and without Medicare, and</p>
<p>BE IT RESOLVED that the Santa Cruz Division calls on President Yudof to decide on retiree health insurance contributions only after the above information is made available and after consultation with all employee groups.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution on Addressing the Unfunded Liability of UCRP</strong></p>
<p><em>Whereas;</em>&#160;a credible plan that provides the long-term funding necessary for the University of California Retirement Program is essential for the general welfare of the University, and</p>
<p><em>Whereas;&#160;</em>all the proposals for pension plan reform (Options A, B and C) anticipate that the employer contribution to the pension plan will have to be 20% of covered payroll in less than a decade,&#160; which is described in the Post-Employment Benefits Task Force Report as a &#8220;frightening challenge&#8221;;</p>
<p>THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Santa Cruz Division of the Academic Senate requests that the Committee on Planning and Budget work with its university wide counterpart to have the employer contribution to the pension plan be increased as rapidly as possible without endangering the critical functioning of the University, so as to reduce the huge employer contributions that will otherwise be needed in the next decade. CPB is requested to report on the results of their efforts at the first meeting of the Academic Senate in Spring 2011.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/ucrpfuture/</url><title>UC

<p>Sold out for weeks in advance, the black-tie-optional event was a chance to mingle with educators, faculty, civic leaders, philanthropists, entrepreneurs, pioneer alumni, donors, artists, and journalists while celebrating the founding principles of UC Santa Cruz and recognizing outstanding achievement.</p>
<p>Honored at the event were:</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Foundation Medal:</strong> Jean-Michel Cousteau</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Fiat Lux Award:</strong> S. H. Cowell Foundation</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Alumni Achievement Award:</strong> Richard Harris</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Faculty Research Lecturer:</strong> Paul Whitworth</p>
<p>Multimedia presentations added to the event, which carried a "Decades of Discovery" theme. Cousteau received the Foundation Medal after an oversized screen showed images of rainbow-colored fish, and piles of ocean trash, illustrating the marine life he is trying to save and the challenges he faces.</p>
<p>Cousteau briefly mentioned one of his biggest triumphs--screening his documentary film, <em>Voyage to Kure,</em> for then-President George W. Bush, showing the president the environmental devastation taking place in the waters off the northwestern Hawaiian islands, and helping to convince him to name 40,000&#160;square miles of ocean, and 10 islands, as part of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument.</p>
<p>"This is an emotional moment because it happens to be my father's hundredth birthday," he said, referring to his famous father, ocean explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau. "I'm sure my parents are listening somewhere, maybe down in the kelp bed out there," he added.</p>
<p>Richard Harris, wearing a banana slug tie, took to the stage to accept his UCSC Alumni Association Award after a brief video showed some of his career highlights as a science journalist, including his travels to China to report on the SARS epidemic and his investigative stories about climate change.</p>
<p>"He's the most effective ambassador for our [science communication] program that I can imagine," said John Wilkes, who founded the program and served as its longtime director before retiring in 2006.</p>
<p>A biographical video showed Faculty Research Lecturer award winner and former Shakespeare Santa Cruz director Paul Whitworth as a young lion in the acting world. Whitworth, during his brief remarks, was self-effacing and candid about the journey that took him to UCSC.</p>
<p>"There were lots of things I passionately wanted to be," he said. "Deep-sea diver, Elvis Presley, Achilles, Picasso, and more recently, Lady Gaga."</p>
<p>Fortunately, Whitworth said, he had mentors who steered him toward being a performer, researcher, and professor.</p>
<p>UCSC also recognized the S. H. Cowell Foundation with the Fiat Lux Award, in honor of the foundation's $4 million in gifts to UC Santa Cruz over the past 45 years, and in response to Cowell's role in jump-starting UCSC.</p>
<p>The campus sits squarely on what was once Cowell Ranch. The foundation also contributed to the construction and naming of UCSC's first college and the Cowell Student Health Center.</p>
<p>In the brief video about the foundation, emeritus vice chancellor Harold "Hal" Hyde said the Cowell family, including rancher and landholder Henry Cowell, who died almost a century ago, would have been "amused and amazed" to see UCSC's continuing stewardship of the former ranch.</p>
<p>"They had a reverential feeling for the land," he said.&#160;</p>
<p>In his opening remarks, Chancellor George Blumenthal said the event was a chance to honor UCSC's history, celebrate its present, and get a glimpse of its future.</p>
<p>"Since I've been chancellor, I still hear things like 'You're the city on the hill, full of protesters--and they don't even get graded!'" Blumenthal said. "Let me tell you something. In academia, reputation lags behind reality by about a decade. When I got here in 1972, people would ask me, "Is there really science at UCSC?"'</p>
<p>In response to this query, Blumenthal, a distinguished professor of astronomy and astrophysics, talked about UCSC getting ranked 68th out of all the world's universities according to the <em>Times of London,</em> UCSC scientists assembling the finished human genome sequence, the widespread use of the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser, and the development of an HIV vaccine.</p>
<p>These days, he said, the question has changed to "Is there humanities at UCSC"?</p>
<p>"The answer is, 'yes'--and more," he responded.</p>
<p>In closing, he mentioned that today's students do, in fact, receive grades.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page

writing instructor Don Rothman</article-subhead><article-text>Don Rothman began teaching undergraduate writing classes at UC Santa Cruz in 1973. <br/>
<br/>
After more than three decades of guiding teachers and teaching college students, the senior lecturer emeritus in writing--and recipient of the 2002 Distinguished Teaching Award from the UCSC Center for Teaching Excellence--has established an endowment to honor exceptional freshman students <em><strong>and</strong></em> their writing teachers. <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The 'First Year Writing Award' seeks to celebrate excellence&#160;in writing among first-year UCSC students, and to give them the chance to honor instructors who contributed to their growth as writers,&#8221; said Rothman. <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It's likely that UCSC would not be the institution that it is now if its founders&#160;hadn't intuited the importance of identifying, challenging, and respecting our beginning students' strengths as thinkers and writers.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
The first awards were presented at an October ceremony which honored seven students and their instructors. <br/>
<br/>
Molly Carpenter received the top prize and had nothing but praise for her teacher, writing lecturer Jeff Arnett. <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Although I&#8217;ve always loved to write, I don&#8217;t think I knew how to truly write thoughtfully until I took Jeff&#8217;s class,&#8221; said Carpenter. &#8220;Jeff consistently pushed me to be the very best writer I could be.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I just want to express how lucky I am to attend a university that encourages original and creative thought through writing, regardless of whether you&#8217;re an engineering or art major,&#8221; she added.<br/>
<br/>
The UCSC Writing Program serves approximately 3,000 students each year, taking into account core classes. More than 100 classes are offered annually. <br/>
<br/>
Writing Program chair James Wilson noted Rothman&#8217;s visionary impact over the years, citing his deep commitment to the writing process, and his ability to bring out the best in both teachers and students. <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Through his years of serving as director of the Central California Writing Project, Don has been a strong advocate for outreach in the wider community, working in schools at all levels from K-12, especially in Santa Cruz County,&#8221; said Wilson.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Wilson added that Rothman has also been a &#8220;deliberate, persistent, and optimistic&#8221; spokesperson for the Writing Program across the campus, speaking with faculty across the divisions about the importance of writing and emphasizing the value of undergraduate education--particularly at a research university. <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Part of Don&#8217;s message is to remind the university that the effective teaching of writing to undergraduate students is essential to the mission of a research university," said Wilson.<br/>

<br/>
I am writing to share with you the recommendations I plan to discuss in November with the UC Board of Regents about&#160;changes to the University&#8217;s post-employment benefits programs.<br/>
<br/>
When I established the Post Employment Benefits Task Force, I made clear that the proposed changes needed to satisfy&#160;two critical objectives: Help address our financial challenges, and preserve good post employment benefits in support of&#160;UC&#8217;s commitment to excellence and in recognition of the vital role our faculty and staff play in the quality and delivery of&#160;UC&#8217;s service to the public. I believe these recommendations achieve these goals.<br/>
<br/>
As you know, for the past two months senior UC leaders and I have been engaged in extensive discussions with faculty,&#160;staff and administrators about how to ensure the financial sustainability of UC&#8217;s retiree health and pension programs&#160;while still providing attractive retirement benefits.<br/>
<br/>
Those discussions are continuing, but the feedback we&#8217;ve received to date has been very consistent, particularly as it&#160;relates to the design of a pension tier for future faculty and staff.<br/>
<br/>
My recommendations &#8211; which have the support of the chair and vice-chair of the Academic Senate, UC&#8217;s Staff Advisors to&#160;the Regents, and leadership of the Council of UC Staff Assemblies &#8211; reflect that feedback.<br/>
<br/>
In short, I am proposing a new pension program for future employees hired after July 1, 2013 that will preserve good&#160;pension benefits while also reducing UC&#8217;s long-term costs. Many elements are similar to the current UCRP program,&#160;including:<br/>
<br/>
<ul class="MailOutline">
<li>A defined benefit or &#8220;pension&#8221; plan;</li>
<li>A five-year vesting period;</li>
<li>A pension benefit formula based on an employee&#8217;s highest average compensation over 36 months; and</li>
<li>A maximum pension benefit equal to 100 percent of an employee&#8217;s working salary.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
There are also some distinct differences that make it a more conservative pension plan than the State of California offers&#160;its employees, including proposals to raise the minimum retirement age from 50 to 55 and the retirement age for&#160;maximum pension benefits from 60 to 65.<br/>
<br/>
I will also recommend that we no longer subsidize survivor benefits and that we eliminate the option of a lump sum cash&#160;out.<br/>
<br/>
This recommendation does not affect pension benefits for current UC employees, or those hired between now and&#160;July 1, 2013 &#8211; only future employees.<br/>
<br/>
The annual cost to UC and its future employees for this proposed new pension program is 15.1 percent of annual payroll,&#160;2.5 percent lower than the 17.6 percent that our current UCRP pension program costs UC and its faculty and staff.<br/>
<br/>
New employees and UC will together pay the full 15.1 percent cost of the new plan, with future faculty and staff&#160;contributing 7 percent of annual pay and UC paying 8.1 percent.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is a very fair and balanced approach, and one that, if adopted by the Regents, will allow UC&#8217;s retirement&#160;benefits to continue to be an important component in attracting and retaining excellent faculty and staff.<br/>
<br/>
Although the new pension tier would affect future employees, I will also recommend changes to our retiree health&#160;program that will directly affect current faculty and staff.<br/>
<br/>
Most notably, I will propose that the Regents adopt in full the recommendations from the Post-Employment Benefits Task&#160;Force on changes to our retiree health program including:<br/>
<br/>
<ul class="MailOutline">
<li>Reduce UC&#8217;s contribution to retiree health premiums over time to a floor of 70 percent;</li>
<li>Change retiree health care eligibility rules, effective July 2013, so that UC&#8217;s contributions to retiree health care&#160;premiums are offered on a graduated scale based on years of service and employee age at retirement;</li>
<li>Allow faculty and staff to remain under the current retiree health care eligibility rules if, on July 1, 2013, they have&#160;five years of UCRP service credit and their age and years of UC service together equal 50 or greater.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
I will also recommend a course of action to erase the UC Retirement Plan&#8217;s $12.9 billion unfunded liability.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most important components of that plan requires UC to increase its annual contributions to the UCRP by 2&#160;percent per year, until UC is contributing roughly 20 percent of annual payroll to UCRP.<br/>
<br/>
There is no question that without state funding support, it will be difficult for UC to find the resources necessary to&#160;contribute such a large amount to the UCRP each year. But given the size of our current unfunded pension liability, it is&#160;essential that we find a way to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Although the state has not yet agreed to pay its share of the UCRP, we have made some important strides on that issue&#160;this year, and we will continue to press our case in Sacramento. In the meantime, we must take &#160;sensible action now to&#160;address our unfunded liability.<br/>
<br/>
The Regents will hear and discuss my proposals at their board meeting in November, and will possibly take action at a&#160;special meeting in December. The full details on my recommendation will be contained in a Regents item that will be&#160;available in early November.<br/>
<br/>
In closing, I want to thank you for your thoughtful input and suggestions on these difficult issues. And I encourage you&#160;to stay involved. Together we are doing the hard work that is essential to preserving this great institution.<br/>
<br/>
With best wishes, I am,<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>According to Laughlin, astronomers are opening a new chapter in human history in which we will know, for the first time, whether Earth-like planets exist around other stars. His lecture will include a discussion of the work that he and his UCSC colleagues are doing to push the envelope in locating potentially habitable planets orbiting the Sun's nearest stellar neighbors. He will describe the role of advanced instruments in this search, from the new Automated Planet Finder Telescope at Lick Observatory to NASA's Kepler space telescope.</p>
<p>Laughlin is a leader in the field of extrasolar planet detection. His <a href="http://oklo.org/">Systemic blog</a> provides regular commentary on the latest developments in the field. Laughlin is also an expert on the long-term fate of the Earth, the solar system, our galaxy, and the universe. He is coauthor of a well-received popular book, <em>The Five Ages of the Universe: Inside the Physics of Eternity.</em></p>
<p>Laughlin's research projects include hydrodynamical and atmospheric modeling, studies of orbital dynamics and evolution, and observational searches for planets using Doppler radial velocity and&#160; photometric transit techniques. He earned a B.S. in physics from the University of Illinois and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in astronomy from UCSC. Before joining the UCSC faculty in 2001, he was a space scientist at NASA Ames Research Center.</p>
<p>Laughlin's talk is part of the Halliday Lecture Series presented by the UCSC Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory. The Halliday Lectures were created and are supported by generous gifts from donors to UCSC astronomy to promote public awareness and appreciation of astronomy.

<p>As punishment for introducing the pair, the young man&#8217;s brother&#8212;the archdeacon&#8217;s prot&#233;g&#233;&#8212;was ban&#173;ished to Utah.</p>
<p>The prot&#233;g&#233; and his wife died there, leaving behind 11 children whose history vanished into the dirt of the land they share&#173;cropped. Years later, Brenda Wong Aoki, one of the exiled prot&#233;g&#233;&#8217;s granddaughters&#8212;a flowing-haired dancer and 1976 graduate of Mer&#173;rill College (community studies)&#8212; resurrected the story in a one-woman play that she took to cities around the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Shintoism, the dead are more important than the living because it is the people who came before us who put us on the path we are on to&#173;day,&#8221; says Aoki from her home near Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. &#8220;If you know your past, you can change your future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three times a National Endowment for the Arts fellow, Aoki has plenty of stories about where she came from, along with ghostly tales of old Japan, which she recounts through dance, music, and spoken word in her award-winning mono&#173;dramas.</p>
<p>Combining the ancient arts of Noh and Kyogen theater and commedia dell&#8217;arte, Aoki brings her stories to life, including tales of her child&#173;hood as a Long Beach &#8220;ghetto girl&#8221; of Japanese, Chinese, Scot, and Spanish descent.</p>
<p>In her working-class neighborhood, she shared close quarters with five siblings. With a laugh, she says the biggest appeal of college was shar&#173;ing a room with only one person.</p>
<p>For Aoki, college was a mixture of discovery, guilt, and self-doubt. She dropped out once to do community work, but returned, brimming with the idea that people also needed food for their souls.</p>
<p>Her experiences as a girl facing prejudice from all sides became a one-woman play and a CD titled, &#8220;The Queen&#8217;s Garden.&#8221;</p>
<p>One night, she says, after per&#173;forming that play in a small high school in Appalachia, two young women came up to say her story had been theirs too. It didn&#8217;t mat&#173;ter that they grew up in a different time or place.</p>
<p>Storytelling is the coming to&#173;gether of everybody, the first art,&#8221; Aoki says. It&#8217;s what shamans did, &#8220;connecting heaven and Earth, and weaving the collective uncon&#173;scious into a community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just as she did that night.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="efa8cc4080727046005a8803229fb5ea"><name>review-fall-2010-abreu</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni in Profile / Stephen Abreu -- At the intersection of business and science</title><summary>Stephen Abreu earned a bachelors in biochemestry and a masters in molecular biology from Kresge College.

<p class="Pa59"><span>If and when that happens, one of the people on the path to that pioneer&#173;ing treatment will be Stephen Abreu, who received his bachelor&#8217;s degree in biochemistry and his master&#8217;s in molecular biology from Kresge Col&#173;lege in 1999 and 2003, respectively.</span></p>
<p>Abreu is an industry contracts man&#173;ager for UC San Francisco&#8217;s famed Diabetes Center and Immune Toler&#173;ance Network, where his job places him at the intersection of business and science.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-5 Abreu took a purpose&#173;ful but zigzagging path to a job he envisioned more than a decade ago. Born into a working-class family, he came to UCSC on a $10,000 Academic Achievement Award created by then-chancellor Karl Pister. Intelligent but slightly adrift, the young man played basketball for UCSC&#8217;s men&#8217;s varsity team, chased girls, and worked at fast-food restaurants to make ends meet.</p>
<p>&#8220;While I loved science, I wasn&#8217;t the best student I could be,&#8221; he admits.</p>
<p>Then, Abreu met molecular biology professor Barry Bowman. Seeing the potential in the skinny, bright undergrad, Bowman helped him nab a grant from the Minority Biomedical Research Support program, admin&#173;istered by the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>The grant allowed Abreu to leave behind his fast-food jobs for work in Bowman&#8217;s lab. Out of that grew a pas&#173;sion for science and the first glimmers of his life&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, the dot-com world was booming and Abreu was fas&#173;cinated by the multi-million-dollar contracts being hatched between business and science. After gradua&#173;tion he went to work on Wall Street at a big investment firm. He spent two years in that fast-paced, cutthroat environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I understood what money meant,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Abreu returned to UCSC and got his master&#8217;s degree working with cal&#173;cium transport proteins, then earned his law degree at UC Davis, followed by a stint at a big legal firm in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Abreu said he is exactly where he wants to be now: helping science move from the lab into doctors&#8217; hands. He helped close the $20 million deal that has UCSF scientists working with Novocell of San Diego to develop a stem-cell therapy for diabetes.</p>
<p>But Abreu, who is of Afro-Caribbean descent, hasn&#8217;t forgotten the role education played in his life. He is on UCSC&#8217;s Alumni Council, and has worked as an advocate for disadvan&#173;taged youth who want to get into law school.</p>
<p>&#8220;UCSC was really a formative place,&#8221; says the recently married Abreu. &#8220;It was a place where I could find myself, where I could find my own way.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="efb7bade80727046005a8803f04e84c2"><name>review-fall-2010-herken</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni in Profile / Gregg Herken -- Unraveling history's mysteries</title><summary>Gregg Herken, a member of UCSC's pioneer class, brought some of the Cold War's secret weapons into public view. </summary><keywords>ucsc, uc santa cruz, gregg herken, cold war, soviets, air and space museum, uc merced, history, pioneer class, georgetown set</keywords><start-date>1287734400000</start-date><display-name>Alumni in Profile / Gregg Herken</display-name><path>/2010/10/review-fall-2010-herken</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/10/review-fall-2010-herken</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1288217016686</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenm</last-modified-by><last-modified>1289257804714</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/herken-gregg-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/herken-gregg-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>herken-gregg-250.jpg</name><display-name>herken-gregg-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>158388</file-size><width>250</width><height>371</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Gregg Herken served for 15 years as chairman of the Department of Space History at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum. (Photograph by Jim McKenzie)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>It sounds like the plot of a Cold War novel: delicate negotiations with the Soviet military, clandestine satellite recovery, the unmasking of a secret Communist in the highest branches of science.</p>
<p>Instead, it&#8217;s part of the life story of Gregg Herken, a retired professor of history at UC Merced and a member of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s first graduating class (Stevenson &#8217;69; history, politics).</p>
<p>Herken borrowed the motto of Cowell College, UCSC&#8217;s founding college&#8212;&#8220;the pursuit of truth in the company of friends&#8221;&#8212;and carried it into his professional life. Herken looked for the truth in some of the mysteries of history, and brought secret weapons of the Cold War into the public view.</p>
<p>Herken made his most publicized discovery while researching his book, Brotherhood of the Bomb, a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in history in 2003. While exploring the lives of the three creators of the nuclear bomb&#8212;Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence, and Edward Teller&#8212;Herken uncovered something Oppenheimer had tried to hide for years. Despite his denials, Oppenheimer had once been a member of a closed unit of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>But was he a spy for the Soviets?&#8221; says Herken. &#8220;Categorically, absolutely not.</p>
<p>Now Herken has turned his research focus toward three men who played pivotal roles in the Cold War: columnist Joe Alsop, Washington Post owner Philip Graham, and head of covert operations for the CIA Frank Wisner.</p>
<p><br/>
&#8220;They got together every Sunday for supper and, basically, they ran the country from those meetings,&#8221; Herken says. His book about &#8220;The Georgetown Set,&#8221; scheduled for publication in 2016, promises an in-depth look at this powerful group and the answer to another mystery: Who tried to blackmail one of those men?</p>
<p>Herken&#8217;s pursuit of truth also came into play in his role as chairman of the Department of Space History at the Smithsonian Institution&#8217;s National Air and Space Museum.</p>
<p>During his 15-year tenure, Herken obtained a top-secret U.S. spy satellite that the government refused to admit even existed at first, and also acquired one of the Cold War&#8217;s most notorious missiles, the Soviet SS-20, for the museum. The latter deal required long negotiations with the Soviet military, three trips to the U.S.S.R., and a last-minute flurry of talks when the missile was unveiled with a very unhistoric &#8220;SS-20&#8221; the Soviets had painted in huge, celebratory red, white, and blue letters on its side.</p>
<p>Herken smiles when he remembers the way his jaw dropped in reaction to the altered missile. But visitors to the Air and Space Museum will only see the results of Herken&#8217;s negotiations: a discreet Cyrillic U.S.S.R. on the 55-foot-tall weapon.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="efc5a85b80727046005a88034cd210f5"><name>sacnas-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC students earn awards at SACNAS national conference</title><summary>Four UCSC students received awards for their research presentations at the 2010 SACNAS National Conference held in Anaheim in October. </summary><keywords>SACNAS</keywords><start-date>1288252800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC students earn awards at SACNAS national conference</display-name><path>/2010/10/sacnas-awards</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/10/sacnas-awards</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1288217929686</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1288218051990</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Environmental Toxicology</value><value>Physics</value><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/winners-540.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/winners-540.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>winners-540.jpg</name><display-name>winners-540.jpg</display-name><file-size>102204</file-size><width>540</width><height>323</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><style type="text/css">/*<![CDATA[*/

<p>UC's <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/open_enrollment_2011.htm">open enrollment</a> period, in which some HealthNet users may choose to switch plans, started Monday and will end on November 23 at 5 p.m.</p>
<p>The bottom line, he said, is that HealthNet subscribers have a &#8220;very difficult choice. You will have to pay more or switch to a new Blue and Gold plan, which may require you to change health-care suppliers.&#8217;&#8217;</p>
<p>He encouraged UCSC employees to think hard about their options &#8220;sooner than later &#8230; This is something we&#8217;re not happy about but that is how it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some audience members pushed for pay raises for non-represented UCSC staff members to help make up for the rise in HealthNet costs.&#160;He said the recently adopted state budget may provide UC with enough support to fund salary increases this year. "But there&#8217;s always the danger that there may be a special session of the [state] legislature with mid-year cuts," Blumenthal cautioned.</p>
<p>The UC system, in spite of the state&#8217;s budgetary woes, fared &#8220;reasonably well&#8217;&#8217; in California's budget, Blumenthal added. He noted that the budget included full funding for Cal Grants, continuing critically important financial aid for students.</p>
<p>UCSC has not yet received its campus allocations but Blumenthal said that the campus will get back 90 percent of the money that student fee increases have generated. &#8220;When I started [as chancellor] we were getting back only 67 percent. Exactly what the total will be for the campus, we don&#8217;t know yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blumenthal ended his remarks by describing the changing student body at UCSC, where 44 percent of this year&#8217;s frosh could become the first in their families to earn a four-year degree.</p>
<p>He also highlighted the six students who recently won <a href="../09/fulbright-winners.xml">Fulbright scholarships</a> to study abroad this year.&#160; &#8220;That is more than half of our pool of applications&#8217;&#8217; for the Fulbright, he added.</p>
<p>During the Tuesday meeting, Blumenthal was part of a panel that included staff advisor designate to UC's Board of Regents Penny Herbert and staff advisor to the Regents Juliann Martinez.</p>
<p>Martinez, who is touring all the campuses in the UC system, said she is taking UC community members&#8217; concerns back to the Regents, including the importance of diversity, the need to address pay disparity, and the need to recruit and retain high-quality faculty and staff.</p>
<p>An audio recording of the meeting will be available online soon. The link will be posted on this page when it is available.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://sab.ucsc.edu</url><title>UCSC Staff Advisory Board</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f13945d480727046005a88032ff8e6c3"><name>open-enrollment-announcement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Open Enrollment 2011</title><start-date>1287993600000</start-date><display-name>Open enrollment announcement</display-name><path>/2010/10/open-enrollment-announcement</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/10/open-enrollment-announcement</link><created-by>jrburns</created-by><created-on>1288242283839</created-on><last-modified-by>jrburns</last-modified-by><last-modified>1288245496613</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The annual Open Enrollment period begins today (Monday, October 25) and ends at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, November 23.&#160; This is the time of year to review your health and welfare benefits and decide whether to make any changes. Unlike recent years when there were relatively minor changes to plan options, the plan changes for next year are significant and present several important decision points.&#160; Please take the time to become fully informed as action is required on your part if you choose to adjust your elections.</p>
<p><span>Significant changes for 2011 include the following:</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Please be aware that due to rising medical plan costs UC is making major changes in medical plans, with premiums for some plans increasing substantially.&#160; Two new medical plans (Health Net Blue &amp; Gold HMO and Anthem Lumenos PPO with HRA) are being introduced as value-priced alternatives for next year.&#160; Providers used by many UCSC employees under the current Health Net HMO are not available under the lower priced Blue &amp; Gold HMO.&#160; For an overview of these changes, please see the&#160;<a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/memo_10-11-10.htm">Preview of New Medical Plans for 2011</a>.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Your children up to age 26 are eligible for UC insurance plans that provide coverage to children (subject to collective bargaining).&#160;&#160;</span>If your children reached or will reach the age of 23 at any time in 2010, you must re-enroll them during Open Enrollment.&#160; UC will not re-enroll them or continue their coverage automatically.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Health Flexible Spending Account funds may no longer be used for over-the-counter medicines such as aspirin, cold medicine, cough drops, etc. unless you have a prescription for that medication.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>If you are a represented employee, medical plan contributions and certain eligibility changes that are not mandated by federal law may be subject to collective bargaining negotiations.&#160; However, plan changes must still be made during Open Enrollment.&#160; Please see&#160;<a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/open_enrollment/employees/e_bargaining_units.html">Information for Represented Employees</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Open Enrollment booklets were mailed to your home last week.&#160; You can find a copy of this booklet and full details of all plan changes on the Open Enrollment website, available on&#160;<a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/open_enrollment/index.html">At Your Service</a>&#160;(<a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/open_enrollment">atyourservice.ucop.edu</a></span><a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/open_enrollment">/</a><a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/open_enrollment">open_enrollment</a>).&#160; The site includes information about UC&#8217;s health and welfare plans, eligibility for coverage, summaries of plan changes, medical plan costs, and much more.</p>
<p><span>If you have questions or need assistance with your enrollment decisions, consider attending an Open Enrollment presentation or participating in a drop-in Help Desk/Open Lab session.&#160; The drop-in sessions are held in the computer lab and assistance will be available to make your changes online.&#160; Schedules may be found on the&#160;<a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/open_enrollment_2011.htm">UCSC Open Enrollment</a>&#160;website.&#160; For individual assistance, please contact the campus Benefits Office at (831) 459-2013.</span></p>
<p><span>We fully recognize that this year presents&#160;<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/10/open-enrollment-monday-oct-25.html">special challenges for our campus</a>&#160;and that the changes in medical plans present difficult choices for a large number of UCSC employees.&#160; For those who elect to change their healthcare provider, the campus is dedicated to supporting you in making that change.&#160; Please refer to the&#160;<a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/open_enrollment_2011.htm">UCSC Open Enrollment</a>&#160;website for helpful information.&#160; We strongly encourage you to use the above resources to become fully informed and to proceed with making your Open Enrollment decisions.</span></p>

<p><span>Cambios significativos para 2011 incluyen los siguientes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>

Los proveedores usados por muchos empleados de UCSC bajo Health Net HMO no est&#225;n disponibles bajo el plan de bajo precio Blue &amp; Gold HMO. Para una explicaci&#243;n de &#233;stos cambios, v&#233;ase</span>&#160;<span><a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/spanish_memo_10-11-10.pdf">Preview of New Medical Plans for 2011</a></span>.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Si usted es un empleado representado, las contribuciones del plan m&#233;dico y ciertos cambios de la elegibilidad que no son asignados por mandato de ley federal, pueden ser sujetados a negociaciones colectivas.

CCREC aims to shape a University of California system-wide multi/transdisciplinary effort using collaborative research methods to address the state&#8217;s interconnected crises in the economy, education, employment, health, nutrition, housing, and the environment. These crises exacerbate social, economic, and political inequalities; threaten the state&#8217;s intellectual, technological, and economic competitiveness; and undermine the capacity of the university to meet its public service mission. CCREC will investigate the intersections of the crises to shape research-based responses directly geared into policy and community contexts.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Students</audience><admin>Professor of Education and Director of the Center for Collaborative Research for an Equitable California (CCREC), Ron Glass </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f90e31c880727046005a88035e2f3a5c"><name>controlled-burns-at-wilder </name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Series of controlled burns planned at Wilder Ranch</title><summary>The California Department of Parks and Recreation is conducting a series of burns totaling 600 acres at Wilder Ranch State Park as conditions allow.</summary><start-date>1288252800000</start-date><display-name>Controlled burns at Wilder Ranch</display-name><path>/2010/10/controlled-burns-at-wilder </path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/10/controlled-burns-at-wilder </link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1288373678425</created-on><last-modified-by>jrburns</last-modified-by><last-modified>1288386809406</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/wilder-burns.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/wilder-burns.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>wilder-burns.jpg</name><display-name>wilder-burns.jpg</display-name><file-size>5691</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The California Department of Parks and Recreation is conducting a series of burns totaling 600 acres at Wilder Ranch State Park as conditions allow.

Under the direction of Vice Chancellor Vani, AVC Scott will lead efforts by the campus to enhance and expand capacity for managing institutional risk, safety and security services.<br/>
<br/>
 Organizational planning and analysis over the next several months will allow the campus to consider best practices for creating a more robust and comprehensive approach for campus safety, risk reduction and emergency planning. This assessment and organizational development is critical for ensuring that the University is appropriately poised for managing campus community safety in our daily operations and emergency response management.<br/>
<br/>
 AVC Scott has served the campus in a number of capacities throughout her eighteen years of service to UCSC, including seven years as Porter College Administrative Officer, service as the Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs for one year and service as the Associate Vice Chancellor for the Colleges and University Housing Services.<br/>
<br/>
 In her leadership of the Colleges and University Housing, she has served as steward for several critical new program and construction initiatives that supported the last ten years of campus enrollment expansion. Highlights include construction of approximately 3,000 student housing units; implementation of Colleges Nine and Ten; expansion of Employee Housing including Ranch View Terrace; and implementation of the University Dining Services program, including the University Center and Terra Fresca.</span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Appointment of AVC for Safety and Risk Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f970833a80727046005a8803b42e453d"><name>ashkon</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alum's video tribute to the Giants is a hit</title><summary>Proud Banana Slug and hardcore San Francisco Giants fan, Ashkon Davaran (Porter '02, Theater Arts) has a grand slam viral hit with his YouTube video tribute to the Giants and their fans, set to a wacky re-mix of the 1981 Journey hit "Don't Stop Believin'."</summary><keywords>ucsc, uc santa cruz, ashkon davaran, sf giants, world series, youtube, viral hit, video, journey, don't stop believin'</keywords><start-date>1288339200000</start-date><display-name>Giants video</display-name><path>/2010/10/ashkon</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/10/ashkon</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1288380121785</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1288891977869</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Theater Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/davaran-ashkon.2-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/davaran-ashkon.2-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>davaran-ashkon.2-400.jpg</name><display-name>daravan-ashkon.2-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>98659</file-size><width>400</width><height>223</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/10/images/davaran-ashkon-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/10/images/davaran-ashkon-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>davaran-ashkon-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>daravan-ashkon-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>29363</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Porter College grad and Theater Arts major Ashkon Davaran has seen his video tribute to the San Francisco Giants go viral with more than 1.5 million hits on YouTube.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Proud Banana Slug and hardcore San Francisco Giants fan, Ashkon Davaran (Porter '02, Theater Arts) has a grand slam viral hit with his YouTube video tribute to the world champion Giants and their fans, set to a wacky re-mix of the 1981 Journey hit "Don't Stop Believin'."</p>
<p>Davaran's "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyVdbfyvwso">Don't Stop Believin': Giants 2010 Official Anthem</a>" had more than 1.5 million hits as of Tuesday, after the Giants won the World Series four games to one by beating the Texas Rangers 3-1 in the fifth game. &#160;</p>
<p>Since Davaran, 29, posted the video October 10 it's attracted national attention as the Giants' fortunes have prospered, including articles in the <a href="http://www.contracostatimes.com/ci_16430595">Contra Costa Times</a>, <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/giants/ci_16433305">San Jose Mercury News</a>, and <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/10/29/DDVH1G2H79.DTL">San Francisco Chronicle</a>.

<p>Davaran and collaborators Nate Houghteling and Kai Hasson filmed sequences for the 3&#189;-minute video just before the first game of the National League Division Series.

Ethics</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong>Designer babies, genetic perfectionism, the selling of human body parts</strong>--are these morally desirable outcomes of the latest developments in scientific research?<br/>
<br/>
<em>Advances in Biotechnology and Medicine: Stretching the Moral Boundaries</em> is just the beginning of a new series of ethics lectures that will be presented by the UC Santa Cruz Humanities Division.<br/>
<br/>
The series is made possible by the Peggy Downes Baskin Humanities Endowment for Interdisciplinary Ethics, a fund created in honor of her longtime interest in ethical issues across the academic spectrum.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are so many areas in which ethical problems arise--in journalism, politics, medicine--and the endowment emphasizes the need to address these issues in a cross-disciplinary context,&#8221; said Baskin.</p>
<p>For the inaugural lecture, UCSC professor emerita of philosophy Ellen Suckiel will discuss the potential moral difficulties brought by advances in genetics, particularly the paradox of &#8220;genetic perfectionism.&#8221;</p>
<p>She will be joined at the event by Mary Rorty, clinical associate professor at the Stanford University Medical Center and faculty associate at the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics.</p>
<p>Suckiel noted that while current and upcoming practices in biotechnology and medicine have distinct benefits for human health and well-being, they may at the same time erode longstanding and valued concepts of respect for the person.</p>
<p>She said that Rorty will address the ways in which people--or their body parts--are sometimes considered as &#8220;property.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The question is: Is it appropriate to buy a body part?&#8221; Suckiel asks. &#8220;Are your organs yours to sell? You can go to China or India and buy a kidney, but in the United States, they don&#8217;t allow it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your body part your property?&#8221; she adds. "In the U.S., it is not considered your property, although you are allowed to sell eggs and sperm. It&#8217;s also OK to give away a kidney; you can donate a kidney in the U.S.--but you can&#8217;t sell it.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Newly retired in July, Suckiel has taught ethics at UC Santa Cruz since the early 1970s. As provost of the campus&#8217;s Stevenson College from 2004-2010, she introduced a number of ethics courses into the college curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The more that we can study ethics in our society, the better we&#8217;ll be able to fight debasement and divisiveness in the world today,&#8221; Suckiel noted.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;There isn&#8217;t sufficient reflection on ethical issues, and if there were, I think we&#8217;d find that people would be much more supportive of each other,&#8221; she added.<br/>

<p>I'm writing in anticipation of Open Enrollment, which begins on Monday, October 25. I want to encourage you to evaluate your options carefully, particularly those related to health insurance. Specifically, the cost of Health Net HMO coverage is increasing dramatically, which is a change that will impact many UCSC employees. The Academic Personnel and Staff Human Resources offices are working with PMG (Physicians Medical Group), the local provider for the lower-cost Health Net Blue and Gold option. PMG assures us they have capacity, and they will be on campus during the Open Enrollment period to meet with employees.</p>
<p>Many of you have shared your concerns about these rate hikes and option changes with me, both at meetings and via e-mail. I understand the hardship they pose, and I share your displeasure. I was actively engaged in conversations with UC colleagues at the systemwide level that I had hoped would provide some relief. Unfortunately, the news is not good. All plans are final, and no changes are forthcoming.</p>
<p><span><span>On Monday, you will receive a letter from the Academic Personnel and Staff Human Resources offices announcing the start of Open Enrollment. Please give thoughtful attention to the options presented. You may want to look closely at other health insurance plans that might not have worked for you in the past. To help you evaluate your choices, our Staff Human Resources office will host several workshops throughout Open Enrollment, which ends November 23 at 5 p.m. Details about those workshops and other resources are available online at:&#160;</span></span><a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/open_enrollment_2011.htm"><span><span>http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/open_enrollment_2011.htm</span></span></a><span><span>. Please monitor that site for news and updates.&#160;</span></span></p>

<p>Escribo en anticipaci&#243;n del per&#237;odo de inscripci&#243;n abierta para sus prestaciones, que comienza el lunes 25 de octubre. Quiero animarles a que eval&#250;en sus opciones cuidadosamente, sobre todo los relacionados al seguro m&#233;dico.&#160; Espec&#237;ficamente, el costo de la tarifa de Health Net aumentara dram&#225;ticamente, un cambio que afectar&#225; a muchos de los empleados de la Universidad. El departamento de Recursos Humanos del Personal y la oficina de Recursos Humanos Acad&#233;micos est&#225;n colaborando con PMG (Physicians Medical Group), los proveedores locales para la opci&#243;n de bajo costo Health Net Blue and Gold.&#160; El PMG nos asegura que tienen capacidad y estar&#225;n en la Universidad con nosotros durante el periodo de inscripci&#243;n abierta para reunirse con empleados.</p>
<p>En las reuniones y v&#237;a correo electr&#243;nico, muchos de ustedes han compartido sus preocupaciones sobre los aumentos de las tarifas. Entiendo la dificultad que plantean, y comparto con ustedes su disgusto. Particip&#233;&#160; activamente en conversaciones con los colegas en el liderazgo de la Universidad de California, con las esperanzas que podr&#237;an ayudar.&#160; Desafortunadamente, no hay buenas noticias. Los planes est&#225;n finalizados, no habr&#225;n cambios.</p>
<p><span><span>El lunes, recibir&#225; una carta del&#160;</span></span><span><span>departamento de Recursos Humanos del Personal y la oficina de Recursos Humanos Acad&#233;micos</span></span><span><span>&#160;que anuncia el comienzo de la inscripci&#243;n abierta.

Sugiero que considere los otros planes de seguro m&#233;dico que tal vez en el pasado no fueron adecuados para usted.&#160; Para ayudarle a evaluar sus opciones, nuestra oficina de&#160;</span></span><span><span>Recursos Humanos del Personal&#160;</span></span><span><span>(SHR) ofrecer&#225; varios talleres sobre la inscripci&#243;n abierta, que termina el 23 de noviembre a las 5 p.m. Los detalles sobre esos talleres y otros recursos son accesibles en:&#160;</span></span><span><span><a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/open_enrollment_2011.htm"><span><span>http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/open_enrollment_2011.htm</span></span></a>.
