"We don't know of any other program like it."</p><p>The new Science and Justice training program goes beyond typical science-ethics training to engage students across disciplines, Reardon explained. "Rather than presuming that one can know in advance what the ethics and justice issues are and that such issues stand outside of the scientific enterprise itself, students in this program will collaborate to develop a joint inquiry that will enable them to discover and respond to the specific questions of ethics and justice that arise in the course of conducting research." </p><p>The introductory course covers topics such as the nature of what can be owned and patented, an issue dependent on the interplay between societal values and science and engineering. </p><p>As an undergraduate, Reardon focused on biology and worked in a molecular-evolution laboratory. Graduate work in science and technology studies at Cornell University led to pioneering work in understanding the co-constitution of contemporary societies and sciences. Her work has helped to document and respond to fundamental social and ethical questions in human genomics research and to scientific issues at stake in bioethical responses to genomics. </p><p>The program was developed by the UCSC Science andJustice Working Group (SJWG). In addition to the NSF funding, it has received support from UCSC through the Division of Social Sciences, the Division of Graduate Studies, the Bio-Info-Nano Research and Development Institute, and the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering. </p><p>It is co-led by Karen Barad, professor of feminist studies, history of consciousness, and philosophy.</p><p>"Rather than leaving the ethical issues to nonscientists after the scientific research has been completed, this grant provides a very exciting opportunity for networking and building collaborations among graduate students in the sciences and engineering and humanities, social sciences, and the arts," Barad said. </p><p>Barad received her Ph.D. in particle physics from the State University of New York at Stony Brook. While maintaining her interest in physics, she has broadened her scope to include research in feminist theory, philosophy of science, epistemology, ontology, and ethics, with a focus on science and justice. Throughout her career, she has promoted conversation among scholars in the sciences, arts, humanities, and social sciences.</p><p>The new program takes advantage of the campus' commitment to social justice and the collaborative spirit among scientists, engineers, social scientists, artists, and humanities scholars fostered by the four-year-old SJWG program. </p><p> "This is possible at UCSC," Reardon said, "because we have a unique community of biologists and engineers who are interested in and committed to social justice issues and a corresponding community of social scientists and humanists interested in science and engineering."</p><p>She added that the program trains scholars in humanities, social science, and art to work collaboratively with natural scientists and engineers. "This is a skill set required by anyone who seeks to interpret social and cultural life in an age increasingly mediated by technoscience." </p><p>"This program will place science and engineering graduate students at an advantage when they look for jobs in cutting-edge fields, which increasingly require the ability to think through the ethical and social questions implicit in research," Reardon said.</p><p>Entry is through a spring quarter introductory seminar in science and justice to be offered on Tuesdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. </p><p>More information is available at</p><p> <a href="http://www.cbse.ucsc.edu/education/science_justice">www.cbse.ucsc.edu/education/science_justice</a>  and</p><p> <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/scienceandjustice">www2.ucsc.edu/scienceandjustice</a></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915f5ccd8072704601a012ff8a12233c"><name>3524</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Meet the Student Regent </title><start-date>1265007600000</start-date><display-name>Meet the Student Regent...</display-name><path>/2010/02/3524</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/02/3524</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339200123</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339200123</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As we approach midterms, I invite you to take a break to meet the current Student Regent Designate, Jesse Cheng.

In its <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/columns/top-100-stories-of-2009">January/February 2010 issue</a>,   <i>Discover</i> selected the paper, "Human Predators Outpace Other Agents of Trait Change in the Wild," for its top 100 list. </p><p>The paper drew worldwide attention when it was published a year ago in the online issue of the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>. </p><p>Darimont and co-authors reviewed 34 previously published studies that measured how fast such traits as body size and age at reproduction had changed in 29 species that people hunt.  The species were mostly fish but also included bighorn sheep, caribou, marine invertebrates, even ginseng. </p><p>The team found that harvested populations change 300 percent faster than those undergoing natural environmental change and 50 percent faster than those changing due to other causes, like pollution. Hunted prey are also on average 20 percent smaller in body size than previous generations, and their age of first reproduction is on average 25 percent earlier. </p><p>Darimont said the team is "pleased about the attention the study garnered and is hopeful that changes to fishing and hunting regulations that shift the focus away from targeting the largest individuals within populations will soon follow."</p><p>Darimont's coauthors are Stephanie M.

The campus maintains a rank despite being the smallest school in its category, with an enrollment of 15,125. </p><p>"We are proud that Banana Slugs entered our large school category this year and still came out among the top in the nation," said Janet Allen, manager of the Peace Corps San Francisco Recruitment Office.</p><p>"Santa Cruz students come to us highly qualified and passionate about serving others around the world," she added.</p><p>UCSC currently has alumni serving in 30 of the 76 countries where Peace Corps works. The highest concentration of Banana Slugs is in Paraguay, Zambia, Niger, and Panama.</p><p>This year's top-ranked schools (in the large, medium, and small categories) are the University of Washington, George Washington University, and St. Olaf College. Historically, UC Berkeley maintains the number one all-time rank, with 3,412 alumni who have served. You can view the entire top 25 rankings for each school size category <a href="http://multimedia.peacecorps.gov/multimedia/pdf/stats/schools2010.pdf">online</a>.</p><p>Martin Case (business management economics, '08) will soon join the Banana Slug tradition of service. Case departs June 1 to train for a two-year assignment in Cameroon. He will work in small business development.</p><p>Case says he is drawn to the Peace Corps to for a "grasp of the bigger picture of world economics through hands-on experience." An active member of his community, Case sang opera at UCSC and volunteers at Santa Cruz's Homeless Garden Project and the Resource Center for Nonviolence.</p><p>At the Feb. 23 Santa Cruz City Council meeting, Case will receive a proclamation declaring March 1-7 as Peace Corps Week in Santa Cruz. The proclamation recognizes the establishment of the Peace Corps by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, as well as the contributions of Californians to the cause of world peace and friendship.</p><p>As the Peace Corps approaches its 50th anniversary, its service legacy continues to promote peace and friendship around the world with 7,671 volunteers serving in 76 host countries.

<p>Using sunlight to split water into hydrogen and oxygen is potentially a clean and sustainable way to generate hydrogen for fuel-cell vehicles. Photovoltaic cells use solar energy to generate electricity, and electricity can be used to split water by electrolysis. But a more direct and efficient approach is provided by photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells, which use solar energy to generate hydrogen inside the cell itself.</p>
<p>The UCSC researchers focused on the semiconductor material used as a light-absorbing anode in the PEC cell. They combined two techniques--called elemental doping and quantum dot sensitization--that have been used to improve the performance of metal oxide semiconductors in solar cells. These techniques use nanotechnology to manipulate the structure of a material on the scale of billionths of a meter.</p>
<p>Previous work in the laboratory of Jin Zhang, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC, showed that this combination of techniques has a synergistic effect, markedly enhancing the performance of photovoltaic cells (see <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1852">earlier story</a>). In the new study, Zhang teamed up with Yat Li, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry, to test the same strategy in a PEC cell.</p>
<p>"Elemental doping and quantum dot sensitization are two different techniques that work well by themselves. We found that we can combine them to get a synergistic effect," Li said. "We not only extended this idea nicely to a photoelectrochemical cell for hydrogen generation, we also proposed a new model to explain the observed experimental data."</p>
<p>Zhang noted that more theoretical work is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved. "Understanding the mechanisms will allow us to optimize the effects," he said. "The model we proposed in the first paper was very preliminary, but the new results have helped us refine our model."</p>
<p>The researchers reported their findings in the journal <em>Nano Letters</em> in a <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl903217w">paper</a> posted online on January 25. Lead authors of the paper were Jennifer Hensel, a graduate student in Zhang's lab, and Gongming Wang, a graduate student in Li's lab.</p>
<p>The researchers synthesized thin films of titanium dioxide nanoparticles, as well as titanium dioxide nanowire arrays vertically aligned in a thin film on a substrate. The titanium dioxide films were doped with nitrogen, and cadmium selenide nanoparticles were used for quantum dot sensitization. The resulting nanostructured composite materials were then used as photoanodes in a PEC cell to compare their performance in carefully controlled experiments.</p>
<p>The results are an important demonstration of the potential to improve the performance of photoelectrochemical cells, as well as photovoltaic solar cells, using carefully designed materials, Zhang said. "The key is that combining different approaches in a rational manner can significantly boost performance," he said.</p>

The ranking reflects the quality of UCSC's research in geosciences and its influence on the field.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted by the British publication <em>Times Higher Education (THE)</em>, using data provided by Thomson Reuters from its Essential Science Indicators database. The analysis looked at scientific papers published in peer-reviewed journals during the period from January 1999 through June 2009. The rankings were based on the number of citations per paper, a measure of the impact a paper's findings have on the field.</p>
<p>"The ranking by citations per paper (impact) seeks to reveal 'heavy-hitters' based on per-paper influence, not mere output," explained an <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=409181&amp;c=1">article</a> accompanying the rankings, published in <em>THE</em> in November 2009.</p>
<p>In this study, the category of "geosciences" includes atmospheric research and oceanography as well as geology and Earth sciences. At UCSC, this would include research conducted in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and the Department of Ocean Sciences.</p>
<p>"To be ranked 18th among research institutions worldwide over a ten year period is an extremely significant accomplishment and speaks to the quality and reputation of our Earth and ocean scientists over a sustained period of time," said Gary Griggs, distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences and director of the Institute of Marine Sciences.</p>
<p>About half of the top 20 institutions are national laboratories and research centers, including the Met Office Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research at the top of the list, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (3rd), and the U.K.'s National Oceanography Centre in Southampton (9th). The only other UC campus in the top 20 is UC Santa Barbara (10th).</p>

Allowing an employee to use up to 30 days of accrued sick leave to care for and bond with a newborn, adopted, or foster-care child.</p><p>.    Increasing the amount of sick leave an employee may use during a family and medical leave on behalf of a spouse, domestic partner, child, or parent from 30 days to a 12-week period.</p><p>.    Increasing the period of time from 15 days to 90 days for reinstatement of all sick leave when an employee is reemployed after a separation.</p><p>.    Increasing the amount of sick leave that an employee may use in the event of the death of a family or household member from 5 to 10 days.</p><p>.    Allowing an employee to use accrued sick leave to donate bone marrow (up to 5 days) or organs for transplant (up to 30 days).</p><p>.    The inclusion of newly enacted Military Caregiver Leave and Qualifying Exigency Leave.</p><p>.    The inclusion of language to clarify that an employee whose appointment is reduced below 50% will no longer accrue vacation leave.</p><p>.    The inclusion of a new section containing a variety of leaves under California Law that are offered to accommodate life event circumstances.</p><p>The proposed Absence from Work Policy and a summary of all proposed changes are posted at: <a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/employees/policies_employee_labor_relations/proposed_policies/prop_staff_policies.html">http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/employees/policies_employee_labor_relations/proposed_policies/prop_staff_policies.html</a></p><p>The University invites your comments on the proposed revisions and consolidation of Staff Leave Policies.

The presentation blended a lecture with dramatic performances using transcripts of interviews Smith has done over the span of her acting career. </p><p>"My project for my adult life has been to go around America with a tape recorder and interview people and then see what would happen if I walked in their words the way you think about walking in someone else's shoes," Smith said. </p><p>Smith is best known for her documentary style in plays such as <i>Fires in the Mirror</i> and <i>Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992,</i> both of which featured her as the sole performer of multiple and diverse characters. </p><p>She said she looks to King for a sense of inspiration and also a sense of history.</p><p>"What I think about when I think about disarray in our society around differences is that we lack the imagination to create an America where <i>everybody</i> gets a great education, where <i>everbody</i> gets great health care, because we can't imagine that our country can't be great unless <i>everyone</i> is great," Smith said. </p><p>Gesturing to the bust of Martin Luther King Jr. onstage, she said, "As I stand in the shadow of this great human being, this great ancestor, what I want to pull from that ancestry tonight is a reignited imagination about the other person."</p><p>Her dramatic monologues illustrating "the other" came from interviews with people including Charlayne Hunter-Gault, who made civil rights history as the first African American woman to graduate from the University of Georgia in 1962, and who went on to establish herself as one of television's premier journalists; with Mrs. Young-Soon Han, a Korean-American whose liquor store was destroyed during the Los Angeles race riots of 1992; and with Twilight Bey, a young African American male and an organizer of a gang truce between the Cripps and the Bloods.</p><p>In one of the monologues, Dr. Kiersta Kurtz-Burke, a physician at the public Charity Hospital in New Orleans, comes to some painful realizations during the Hurricane Katrina disaster. Patients at private hospitals had long been evacuated, while Charity Hospital patients and nurses went through six days without electricity, food, or water. In talking with her patients, who were mostly African American and poor, she found they had assumed they would not be helped by the government.  </p><p>"They knew we were going to be the last ones out, they knew that the people in the private hospitals had private helicopters, it wasn't a shock to anybody," said Smith as Kurtz-Burke.  </p><p>"The fact that it wasn't a shock to people was so shocking to me, and you just see the desperation of being poor in this country, and in some ways the distrust, I mean the deep down--that this is not the first time this has happened to people," she continued, in character.

Sloan Foundation has awarded a Sloan Research Fellowship to Jonathan Fortney, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. </p><p>The prestigious two-year fellowship includes a grant of $50,000 to support Fortney's research, which focuses on understanding the atmospheres and internal structures of planets. The Sloan Research Fellowships seek to stimulate fundamental research by early-career scientists and scholars of outstanding promise. Fortney is among 118 researchers awarded the fellowships this year in recognition of distinguished performance and a unique potential to make substantial contributions to their fields.</p><p>A theoretical astrophysicist, Fortney uses computer modeling techniques to interpret observations of planets outside our solar system (known as extrasolar planets or exoplanets). He and his colleagues search for the signatures of molecules like water and methane in the atmospheres of these planets. Another focus of his research is the thermal evolution of the solar system's giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn.</p><p>Over 400 extrasolar planets have been detected, and Fortney's work makes connections between these distant planets, which astronomers are just beginning to understand, and the planets of our solar system, for which there is a long history of research. Fortney is a member of the science team for NASA's Kepler Mission, which is searching for Earth-like planets using a specially designed space telescope. His role in the mission is to help understand the structure and other properties of planets detected by the telescope. </p><p>"The primary goal of the Kepler mission is to measure the frequency of Earth-size planets in Earth-like orbits around Sun-like stars. This may be the most important number in the history of astronomy," Fortney said.</p><p>Fortney earned a B.S. in physics from Iowa State University and Ph.D. in planetary sciences from the University of Arizona. He joined the UCSC faculty in 2008.</p><p>The Sloan Research Fellowships have been awarded since 1955. Fellows are free to pursue whatever lines of inquiry are of most interest to them, and they are permitted to employ fellowship funds in a wide variety of ways to further their research aims. </p><p>The <a href="http://www.sloan.org">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a> is a philanthropic, not-for-profit grantmaking institution that supports original research and broad-based education in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and economic performance. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915f77598072704601a012ffe2955f1a"><name>3540</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Night at SAP Open sported stars, supported tennis</title><summary>UCSC Night at the SAP Open Tennis Tournament on February 10 drew 275 alumni and friends to the HP Pavilion.</summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-2495, gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>UCSC Night,  SAP Open Tennis Tournament, Andy Roddick, Fernando Verdasco</keywords><description>UCSC Night at the SAP Open Tennis Tournament on February 10 drew 275 alumni and friends to the HP Pavilion.</description><start-date>1266390000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Night at SAP...</display-name><path>/2010/02/3540</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/02/3540</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339206947</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339206947</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/02/images/hass.tommy.sap.open.2.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/02/images/hass.tommy.sap.open.2.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hass.tommy.sap.open.2.300.jpg</name><file-size>13943</file-size><width>300</width><height>173</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Tennis pro Tommy Haas stopped by the pre-match dinner, much to the delight of the UCSC Women's Tennis Team. </image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/02/images/slug.sammy.sap.open.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/02/images/slug.sammy.sap.open.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>slug.sammy.sap.open.300.jpg</name><file-size>19638</file-size><width>300</width><height>232</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Mascot Sammy Slug on center court for the coin toss is seen on the HP Pavilion jumbotron.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UCSC Night at the SAP Open Tennis Tournament on February 10 drew 275 alumni and friends to the HP Pavilion to watch Andy Roddick and Spain's Fernando Verdasco play first-round singles matches.

Morphologically distinct types are often found within species, and biologists have speculated that these "morphs" could be the raw material for speciation. What were once different types of individuals within the same population could eventually evolve into separate species. </p><p>A new study conducted by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, supports this idea. The study documents the disappearance of certain morphs of the side-blotched lizard in some populations. The researchers reported their findings in a paper published this week in the online early edition of <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).</i></p><p>The side-blotched lizard, <i>Uta stansburiana,</i> has three morphs differing in color and mating behavior. Barry Sinervo, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, has studied a population of side-blotched lizards near Los Banos, Calif., for over 20 years. Ammon Corl, now a postdoctoral researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden, led the new study as a graduate student at UCSC and is first author of the paper.  </p><p>Previous work by Sinervo and his colleagues showed that competition among male side-blotched lizards takes the form of a rock-paper-scissors game in which each mating strategy beats and is beaten by one other strategy. Males with orange throats can take territory from blue-throated males because they have more testosterone and body mass. As a result, orange males control large territories containing many females. Blue-throated males cooperate with each other to defend territories and closely guard females, so they are able to beat the sneaking strategy of yellow-throated males. Yellow-throated males are not territorial, but mimic female behavior and coloration to sneak onto the large territories of orange males to mate with females. </p><p>"My goal when starting my Ph.D. thesis research was to understand how this fascinating mating system evolved," Corl said. "We studied lizard populations from California to Texas and from Washington State down to Baja California Sur in Mexico."</p><p>Corl found the three color morphs in many places, but not everywhere. Some populations were missing some of the color morphs. For example, populations in the northwest only have orange-throated lizards, while only orange- and blue-throated morphs are found on Anacapa Island in the Channel Islands. In the field, the researchers captured lizards to collect tissue samples for DNA analysis and then released them back into the wild. In the lab, they used the tissue samples to get DNA sequences from all of the lizard populations in the study. </p><p>"Based on these sequences, we reconstructed the 'family tree' of the lizard populations and figured out which populations were more closely related to one another. This let us figure out how the mating strategies evolved," Corl said.</p><p>The results showed that all three color morphs existed millions of years ago and have persisted since then in many populations. Over time, however, some branches of the lizard family tree lost some of the color types. </p><p>"What was particularly interesting was the pattern in how color morphs were lost," Corl said. "Any time there was a loss, the yellow type--the sneaky males that mimic females--was the first to go. Thus, the rock-paper-scissors game can break down on an evolutionary timescale. Something about the game must change so that, for instance, both the rock and scissors strategies are able to beat paper."</p><p>Sinervo has documented the cycling of the rock-paper-scissors game at his main study site for 22 years, with the dominant morph in the population changing every four to five years. "It's like an evolutionary clock ticking between rock, paper, scissors then back to rock," he said. "Ammon's research indicates that the game has been cycling for millions of years at some sites, and yet at other sites it collapses on one or two strategies and begins to create new species. It is simply mind-boggling to think about deep time and these evolutionary cycles."</p><p>Many aspects of the evolutionary history of these lizards are consistent with the theory that morphs can be involved in speciation, Corl said. Evolutionary theory predicts that new species could arise from particular morphs originally found in a population containing multiple morphs. Side-blotched lizards started off with three color morphs. If just one or two types occur in a population, they look just like the original morphs. </p><p>The theory was also supported by patterns in the formation of subspecies, which are the precursors to new species. Two subspecies of side-blotched lizard that originated from populations with three morphs now have only a single color morph. Thus, populations that lose morphs are not transitory, but can persist and eventually become a different species.</p><p>The study also found evidence to support the hypothesis that rapid evolutionary change occurs when particular morphs are lost from the system. "Imagine the three lizard morphs playing rock-paper-scissors," Corl explained. "They have very specific adaptations for fighting one another. Now imagine that some morphs are lost, leaving a population of all rock morphs. Their adaptations for fighting the paper and scissors morphs are no longer useful. Therefore, rapid evolutionary change is expected in a population of rock morphs as they adapt to a new game in which they only fight other rock morphs."</p><p>The study showed clear evidence of very rapid evolution of body size when morphs are lost from a population. "Such rapid evolution could eventually cause populations to evolve into distinct species. We are the first group to provide a statistical test of this hypothesis," Corl said.  </p><p>The idea of morphs being involved in speciation is an old one. Charles Darwin conducted experiments with different reproductive morphs in flowers to try to gain insight into the process of speciation. However, the new paper by Corl and colleagues is one of the first studies to use modern techniques to tackle the problem of morphs and speciation. </p><p>"My hope is that the paper will inspire other researchers to consider a role for morphs in the evolution of the species that they study," said Corl. "For most species, the speciation process is thought to begin only after populations are geographically separated. Our study shows that the distinctive morphs that build up within populations are important for understanding speciation. Thus, the first stages of new species may occur within and not between populations. This idea could fuel lots of interesting research for many years to come."</p><p>In addition to Corl and Sinervo, the other coauthors of the paper are Alison Davis, a graduate student in Sinervo's lab now at UC Berkeley, and Shawn Kuchta, a postdoctoral researcher in Sinervo's lab now at Dartmouth University.

In the microbial world, an unusual marine microorganism appears to have ditched several major metabolic pathways, leaving it with a remarkably reduced set of genes. </p><p>This metabolic minimalist is a specialist uniquely suited to performing one very important function: taking nitrogen gas from the atmosphere and "fixing" it into a form that makes this essential nutrient available to other organisms. Nitrogen fixation fertilizes the oceans, controlling overall biological productivity and thereby affecting how much carbon dioxide the oceans absorb from the atmosphere. </p><p>Jonathan Zehr, the marine microbiologist who discovered the microbe, said it has stubbornly resisted efforts to grow it in the laboratory. But that hasn't stopped his team from determining the complete DNA sequence of its genome. Genome analysis enabled the researchers to reconstruct the organism's unusual metabolic lifestyle. They published their findings in <i>Nature</i> in a paper available online February 21. </p><p>Zehr, a professor of ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz,  characterized the microbe as an atypical member of the cyanobacteria, a group of photosynthetic bacteria formerly known as blue-green algae. Still lacking a formal taxonomic classification, it is known only as UCYN-A. First detected in the open ocean near Hawaii in 1998, it is now known to be periodically abundant in tropical and subtropical waters throughout the world. </p><p>"Biogeochemists have never been able to balance the nitrogen budget of the oceans--there seems to be more nitrogen produced than we can account for from known organisms. So this organism may be an important part of the overall nitrogen budget," Zehr said.</p><p>In a 2008 paper in <i>Science,</i> Zehr's team <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2555">reported</a> that UCYN-A is completely lacking the genes for a key component of the photosynthetic apparatus. The missing parts, known as photosystem II, carry out the stage in photosynthesis that generates oxygen by splitting water molecules. This is significant because oxygen inhibits nitrogen fixation. Most nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria carry out photosynthesis during the day and nitrogen fixation at night, but UCYN-A can fix nitrogen all day long.</p><p>The new paper extends the list of UCYN-A's missing metabolic pathways to include, among other things, a process central to aerobic metabolism known as the TCA cycle or Krebs cycle. It also lacks the Calvin cycle, which uses the carbon from carbon dioxide to build sugars, and it is unable to synthesize about half of the 20 essential amino acids.</p><p>"This thing is really stripped down," said James Tripp, a bioinformatics specialist at UCSC and lead author of the <i>Nature</i> paper. "My analysis indicates it has to have an outside source to obtain sugars, amino acids, and two out of the four bases needed to make DNA."</p><p>Tripp performed the genome analysis reported in the paper. He worked closely with scientists at 454 Life Sciences, a Roche company based in Branford, Conn., that specializes in high-throughput DNA sequencing technology. The researchers applied new genome sequencing and assembly techniques to produce the complete genome sequence from natural samples of DNA. Because UCYN-A cannot be cultured, researchers used a cell-sorting technique called flow cytometry to obtain concentrated samples of the microbe from ocean water, and then extracted DNA from the cells for sequencing.</p><p>Although UCYN-A must depend on other organisms for key nutrients, the researchers have found no evidence that it lives in a close symbiotic association with another microorganism. Zehr said the failure to find another organism closely associated with it suggests two possibilities. "It might live in a cryptic association that's very hard to sample because it's fragile and just falls apart, or it may respond to blooms of other phytoplankton and live in the soup of nutrients excreted by other organisms," he said.</p><p>One of the striking things about UCYN-A's metabolism is that it lacks essential pathways other organisms use to generate energy for their cells. "Nitrogen fixation takes a lot of energy, but this thing has figured out how to fix nitrogen without the normal pathways used to fuel it in other organisms," Zehr said. "It presents a real evolutionary and ecological paradox."</p><p>In addition to Zehr and Tripp, the coauthors of the <i>Nature</i> paper include graduate student Shellie Bench, specialist Kendra Turk, and postdoctoral scholar Rachel Foster in Zehr's lab at UCSC, and Brian Desany, Faheem Niazi, and Jason Affourtit of 454 Life Sciences.

<p>8,000 people in the Port-au-Prince neighborhood of Delmas. Nearly half are children, he said, and many were lucky to have lost only their homes. A quick assessment showed that more than half the children lost a close family member. About 10 percent lost a parent.</p>
<p>"Child exploitation increases after a crisis," Hoffman said before flying first to the Dominican Republic and then to Port-au-Prince. He left on Valentine's Day and arrived February 16.</p>
<p>In an e-mail four days after arriving, Hoffman said vulnerability of children is increasing. "Children are at more risk of exploitation, malnutrition, disease, abandonment, and mental health problems," he wrote. "This is still a serious public health crisis for children; in fact, the crisis could worsen for children at this stage.</p>
<p>"We're likely to see more child abandonment, life-threatening illness, and exploitation now," said Hoffman, who teaches several courses at UC Santa Cruz, including one, Children in Extreme Circumstances. "We're trying to set up water sanitation and basic public health for the children," he said.</p>
<p>Hoffman, who also sits on the Bonny Doon school board, said he is currently on a small lecturer's contract this quarter due to budget cuts at UCSC. He was supervising field-study students who encouraged him to help in Haiti while continuing to supervise them using Skype and e-mail. His students are following his work at <a href="http://tonyhoffman.posterous.com/">http://tonyhoffman.posterous.com/</a>, a blog where he posts updates of work with ARC including photographs of "child-friendly spaces'' ARC has established.</p>
<p>He has also been able to serve as an on-the-ground contact for people with family in Haiti, including a Santa Cruz couple that had been seeking photos about their relatives' living situation. Chelsea George, whose husband Andre Cherer is Haitian, said his family is living in tents near their damaged houses. She contacted Hoffman before he left Santa Cruz. He e-mailed Wednesday to say her husband's family is safe. ". No one is hurt," he wrote, "and their house has cracks in it -- but I think it is repairable." He also e-mailed photographs.</p>
<p>Hoffman plans to work in Port-au-Prince until the end of March on psychosocial assessments of vulnerable families and children, and assisting with the development of community-based protection mechanisms in the displacement areas. He said he will also assist in training local professionals in primary response mental health services.</p>
<p>"Phase 1, the emergency phase is over," he said. "Traffic is in the street, people are opening stores." Survivors are living in large displacement areas in tents and other temporary structures. "This stage of the relief effort is about stabilization - providing food, water, sanitation, and other basic needs."</p>
<p>"At this stage, it is time for physical and spiritual healing, for people to start repairs or to resettle, to help others in more need," he said. "As far as children are concerned, now is the time to place them with caring relatives, stabilize care for them and restart school. I admire how hard Haitians are working to do this."</p>
<p>Hoffman, who has a clinical practice in child psychology in Santa Cruz, has worked in other child protection efforts in war zones and poverty situations with grants and fellowships from UCSC, including the Center for Teaching Excellence. The ARC is a private nonprofit relief organization based in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>He said he has often seen cases of well-intentioned people trying to conduct mass adoptions of "orphans" from crisis zones - particularly in Africa - such as the missionaries from Idaho who were arrested when they attempted to take 33 children across the border to the Dominican Republic. Eight of the 10 arrested were released Wednesday.</p>
<p>That case "is the tip of the iceberg," Hoffman said, saying many well-intentioned people from wealthy countries intervene with the "intention of saving the children by adopting them into families in their wealthier nation.</p>
<p>"Often they come with the best of intentions and great motivation, but not</p>
<p>with an educated, well-informed tactic," he said.</p>

<p>Hoffman said his UCSC classes involve the growing research on intervention for children in crisis situations. "The urgent need is to transform good intentions into good practice respecting the rights and holistic needs of children," he said. "Let's transform good intentions into good action."</p>

He was 77.</p>
<p>A resident of La Selva Beach, Schusterman was a research marine biologist and adjunct professor of ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, from 1985 until his retirement in 2003. He was best known for his research on hearing, vision, and cognitive abilities of marine mammals. At UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory, he worked with California sea lions, harbor seals, and elephant seals, conducting careful experiments to understand how they perceive and think about the world around them.</p>
<p>"Ron carried out truly pioneering work on cognition and sensory physiology of marine mammals. He was an exceptional experimentalist, and his research has stood the test of time, ranking among the classic works on marine mammals and animal cognition," said Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC.</p>
<p>Born in New York City and raised in the Bronx, Schusterman earned a B.A. in history and political science at Brooklyn College and both an M.A. and Ph.D. in psychology at Florida State University. His first research position was at the Yerkes Laboratory of Primate Biology in Florida, where he investigated the cognitive and social behavior of chimpanzees, gibbons, and monkeys. He maintained a lifelong interest in primatology and could produce startlingly realistic calls of gibbons, howler monkeys, and other primates.</p>
<p>In 1963, Schusterman was recruited by the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in Palo Alto to study the behavior and sensory physiology of pinnipeds (seals and sea lions). There he helped debunk the idea that pinnipeds use echolocation like dolphins and bats do. He continued to study hearing and vision in pinnipeds, first at SRI and later at California State University at Hayward (now CSU East Bay), where he held a joint appointment in the psychology and biology departments. In 1985, he moved his research program to UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory, where he helped establish the lab's reputation as a leading center for marine mammal research.</p>
<p>Schusterman's work with California sea lions included an ambitious and long-running program involving artificial sign language. This led to important contributions in the areas of language learning and the foundations of complex cognition in humans and other animals.</p>
<p>"He taught sea lions sign language and showed that they could understand syntax and a series of commands that formed a very simple artificial language," Costa said. "Until Ron's work, only chimps and gorillas, and later dolphins, were thought to be capable of that."</p>
<p>His studies of hearing in marine mammals helped to raise awareness of the potential impacts of manmade noise in the ocean environment. He also studied how a variety of marine mammals use sound to communicate, including recent work on the vocal behavior and learning capabilities of walruses.</p>
<p>The research program Schusterman established at UCSC has continued since his retirement under the direction of Colleen Reichmuth, a research biologist who began working in Schusterman's lab as an undergraduate and went on to earn her Ph.D. with him. According to Reichmuth, Schusterman used his extensive knowledge of conditioning and learning theory to develop some of the first, most creative, and most enduring approaches to training and studying marine mammals in captivity. He remained involved in the research program after his retirement and continued to mentor a small group of graduate students at UCSC.</p>
<p>"He was extremely influential, not only as a pioneer in the field of marine mammal research, but also as a mentor to many of the most productive scientists in the field," Reichmuth said.</p>
<p>A founding and honorary member of the Society for Marine Mammalogy, Schusterman was a fellow of the Animal Behavior Society, Acoustical Society of America, American Psychological Association, American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the California Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife Francie Moore Schusterman; his daughters Marisa De Mello, Nikki Montez, and Lesli Schusterman; and seven grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, donations in his memory may be made to the Palo Alto Medical Clinic Cardiac Research Fund or to the <a href="http://www.pinnipedlab.org">Pinniped Cognition &amp; Sensory Systems Laboratory</a> at UCSC. A memorial service is being planned for Sunday, February 28. For more information, contact info@pinnipedlab.org.</p>

I want to thank Dave once again for his outstanding service and also express my confidence that the outcome of the search process will make us proud.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915f97848072704601a012ff487a15da"><name>3561</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Mandatory Online UC Ethical Values Compliance Briefing to Launch on February 25, 2010 </title><start-date>1266822000000</start-date><display-name>Mandatory Online UC Ethical...</display-name><path>/2010/02/3561</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/02/3561</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339215172</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339215172</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>On February 25, 2010, the Compliance Briefing will begin on the UCSC campus for staff and academic employees. If you are required to take this course, you will receive a personalized link from the UC Learning Center (UCLearningCenter@UCOP.edu) that will direct you to the online Compliance Briefing. You will have until December 2010 to complete the course, which should take about 20 to 30 minutes. Employees will be required to re-take the course each year.</p><p>The Ethics briefing is designed to reinforce the <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/ucophome/coordrev/policy/Stmt_Stds_Ethics.pdf">University of California Statement of Ethical Values and Standards of Ethical Conduct</a> adopted by the UC Regents in May 2005 and to convey University employment obligations with respect to ethical and compliant behavior.</p><p>The Briefing may be taken on any computer with internet access and does not need to be completed in one sitting. However, if you do not complete the course in one sitting please retain your email with the personalized link so you can re-access it for later completion. The Briefing will remain available to you for reference throughout the year. Classroom versions of the briefings for non-computer users will be available later this year.</p><p><a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/compliance/index.htm">Visit UCSC Compliance Briefing</a> for more detailed information about the briefings, course usage tips, technical information, intended audience and campus contacts.</p><p>Thank you in advance for your participation and cooperation in meeting this requirement. </p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Faculty and Staff</audience><admin>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915f99248072704601a012ffbda96590"><name>3562</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>TK</title><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-2495, gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1266822000000</start-date><display-name>TK...</display-name><path>/2010/02/3562</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/02/3562</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339215579</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339215579</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>TK</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915f9a778072704601a012ffe5a20d2a"><name>3563</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Commitment to UCSC Principles of Community &amp;

I speak on behalf of the entire Division of Student Affairs in condemning student behavior that is disrespectful, offensive, and demeaning to other students and members of our campus community. The latest incidents at UC San Diego have impacted African American students most deeply as well as others concerned about diversity and the campus climate for students of color. I urge you to reach out to your peers and show your support and seek assistance if you are struggling with any issues. The Dean of Students office, Counseling and Psychological Services, SOAR, and ethnic resource centers are some of the resources available to you.</p><p>It is our shared responsibility to ensure UCSC is an inclusive environment where all students have a voice and can engage in a positive, open campus community and be treated with respect. We value academic freedom and First Amendment rights. However, acts of discrimination do not reflect our values and violations of Hate/Bias Policy will not be tolerated. We reaffirm the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles_community.asp">Principles of Community</a> and our commitment to creating a living-learning community where all students can thrive and be successful. I encourage you to remember these principles as well as other campus policies such as <a href="http://campuslife.ucsc.edu/student_resources/Appendix%202%20Use%20of%20University%20Properties%20and%20Free%20Speech%20Brochure.pdf">Time, Place, and Manner</a> (for protests and free speech) and the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/judicial/handbook.shtml">Student Policies and Regulations Handbook</a>, which help protect the rights of the entire campus.</p><p>As a division, we will continue our cultural and diversity efforts and support campus-wide initiatives that seek to improve the overall campus climate. Join me in making UCSC a place we can all be proud of. Let's work together to create a welcoming, safe, and inclusive campus. I invite you to share your ideas with me during my weekly office hours for students on Fridays from 10:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. at Kerr Hall.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Student Community</audience><admin>Felicia McGinty, Vice Chancellor, Student Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915f9c018072704601a012ff3fb801ab"><name>3564</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Temporary Closure of Student Health Center</title><start-date>1266562800000</start-date><display-name>Temporary Closure of Student...</display-name><path>/2010/02/3564</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/02/3564</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339216319</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339216319</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER CLINIC 2/26/2010 AND 3/1/2010</p><p>Due to developments in the building renovation project beyond our control, the UCSC Student Health Center will be closed for medical and pharmacy services on Friday 2/26/10 and Monday 3/1/10.

Lin, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. Lin is a coauthor of the new study and the founding director of the <a href="http://www.kavlifoundation.org/peking-university">Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics</a> (KIAA) at Peking University, which was deeply involved with the research. The findings are being published in the February 25 issue of <i>Nature.</i></p><p>The research was led by Shu-lin Li of the National Astronomical Observatories of China. A graduate of KIAA, Li and a team of researchers analyzed observational data on the planet to show how the gravity of its parent star is both inflating its size and spurring its rapid dissolution.</p><p>WASP-12b, discovered in 2008, is one of the most enigmatic of the 400-plus planets that have been found outside our Solar System over the past 15 years. It orbits a star in the constellation Auriga that is roughly similar in mass to our Sun. Like most known extrasolar planets, it is large and gaseous, resembling Jupiter and Saturn in this respect. But unlike Jupiter, Saturn, or most other extrasolar planets, it orbits its parent star at extremely close range--75 times closer than the Earth is to the Sun, or just over 1 million miles. It is also larger than astrophysical models would predict. Its mass is estimated to be almost 50 percent larger than Jupiter's and its volume is six times Jupiter's. It is also unusually hot, with a daytime temperature of more than 2500 degrees Celsius.</p><p>Some mechanism must be responsible for expanding this planet to such an unexpected size, say the researchers. They have focused their analysis on tidal forces, which they say are strong enough to produce the effects observed on WASP-12b. </p><p>On Earth, tidal forces between the Earth and the Moon cause local sea levels rise and fall modestly twice a day. WASP-12b, however, is so close to its host star that the gravitational forces are enormous. The tremendous tidal forces acting on the planet completely change its shape into something similar to that of a rugby or American football.</p><p>These tides not only distort the shape of WASP-12b. By continuously deforming the planet, they also create friction in its interior. The friction produces heat, which causes the planet to expand. "This is the first time that there is direct evidence that internal heating (or 'tidal heating') is responsible for puffing up the planet to its current size," said Lin.</p><p>Huge as it is, WASP-12b faces an early demise, Lin said. In fact, its size is part of its problem. It has ballooned to such a point that it cannot retain its mass against the pull of its parent star's gravity. As the study's lead author Li explained, "WASP-12b is losing its mass to the host star at a tremendous rate of six billion metric tons each second. At this rate, the planet will be completely destroyed by its host star in about ten million years. This may sound like a long time, but for astronomers it's nothing. This planet will live less than 500 times less than the current age of the Earth."</p><p>The material that is stripped off WASP-12b does not directly fall onto the parent star. Instead, it forms a disk around the star and slowly spirals inwards. A careful analysis of the orbital motion of WASP-12b suggests circumstantial evidence of the gravitational force of a second, lower-mass planet in the disk. This planet is most likely a massive version of the Earth--a so-called "super-Earth."</p><p>The disk of planetary material and the embedded super-Earth are detectable with currently available telescope facilities. Their properties can be used to further constrain the history and fate of the mysterious planet WASP-12b.</p><p>In addition to KIAA, support for the WASP-12b research came from NASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the National Science Foundation. Along with Li and Lin, co-authors include Jonathan Fortney, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, and UCSC graduate student Neil Miller.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915fa3418072704601a012ff2dcd44dd"><name>3569</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>&lt;b&gt;NPR's "Day to Day"&lt;/b&gt; program featured environmental studies professor Chris Wilmers in a report on tracking mountain lions in the Santa Cruz Mountains</summary><description>&lt;b&gt;NPR's "Day to Day"&lt;/b&gt; program featured environmental studies professor Chris Wilmers in a report on tracking mountain lions in the Santa Cruz Mountains</description><start-date>1266994800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2010/02/3569</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/02/3569</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339218189</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339218189</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong>NPR's "Day to Day"</strong> program featured environmental studies professor Chris Wilmers in a report on tracking mountain lions in the Santa Cruz Mountains.</p>

I also would like to discuss UC and UCSC advocacy efforts currently under way.</p><p>One of my top priorities as chancellor has been to call attention to the way resources are distributed among individual campuses, based on my belief that these practices are outdated and inequitable. They have placed Santa Cruz at a competitive disadvantage and threaten our ability to achieve our full potential.</p><p>This plays out in the distribution of state funds and educational fees. The net effect of most current practices is to reward campuses with the biggest budgets. This preserves the status quo and exacerbates the differences in funding per student among the various campuses.</p><p>I have worked with UC's Office of the President to revisit these formulas and am gratified to report that we've made some progress. Our campus now retains 80 cents from every dollar generated by recent fee increases, compared to 66 cents in 2007-08. UCOP also is reviewing this policy as it applies to the most recent fee hike. Both are encouraging developments.</p><p>I pressed these issues again last week during a meeting with UC President Mark Yudof in our discussion of UCSC budget impacts and challenges. I was joined in that discussion by Senate Chair Lori Kletzer, Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger, and Vice Chancellor of Planning and Budget Peggy Delaney, all of whom reinforced the need for greater transparency and fairness in systemwide budgeting. I believe we are being heard, and we will continue to make the case for our campus receiving its full share of our education fees. We may not get there overnight, but a fairer allocation process is critical to our future.</p><p>As this work continues, it is also imperative that I continue to invest time in Sacramento, pressing the case for our campus and the University of California. The effects of disinvestment by the state in UC are becoming clearer by the day, and it is up to all of us to make the case for renewed public support. UC student associations from across the system are hosting a day of advocacy on March 1. I will be in Sacramento to stand with students as they lobby for the university. I encourage you to get involved, whether by going to Sacramento or by contacting elected officials to voice your support for UC.</p><p>In addition, our campus recently hosted a <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=3512">Legislative Forum on the Budget and Public Higher Education</a> that allowed local legislators to hear directly from students and faculty about the impacts of serial budget cuts. State Assemblymember Ira Ruskin attended the forum with colleagues Assemblymember Bill Monning and Senator Joe Simitian. All three legislators are vocal champions of higher education--and UC alumni. It's vital they understand the campus impacts of diminished UC budgets.</p><p>Finally, UCSC's seventh annual Scholarship Benefit Dinner on February 6 raised nearly $175,000 for student scholarships. The evening featured presentations by UCSC alumni Dan Roam and Ezequiel Olvera, as well as UC President Mark Yudof. Held at the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose, the event boosted our profile in Silicon Valley and raised awareness of the financial burden facing many of our students.

Organized by the UC Student Association, these meetings will bring together students, legislators, several chancellors, and a few UC regents for discussions as elected officials are establishing their budgetary priorities. </p><p>We salute the initiative of UC's student leaders, including UCSC students Victor Sanchez, who is chair of the system-wide UC Student Association, and Michelle Romero, a member of the UCSC Student Union Assembly. Chancellor Blumenthal will participate in meetings with Victor, Michelle, and legislative leaders.</p><p>Additionally, we anticipate that many UCSC students will participate in the national Day of Action for Public Education on Thursday, March 4. As we have said before, we welcome the involvement of students, faculty, other academic employees, and staff in advocating on behalf of the university. There is a role for each of us in calling attention to the impact of budget cuts at UCSC.</p><p>We are concerned, however, about possible disruptions to campus operations on Thursday, and we want to remind participants that their right to freedom of expression must not infringe on the rights of others who may choose not to participate in rallies or demonstrations. Many students will want and need to go to class that day, and all campus employees deserve the opportunity to do their jobs without interference. </p><p>While we are hopeful that March 4 activities won't interfere with campus transportation systems and access to the campus, we encourage you to monitor events as they unfold. The Public Affairs Office has created a <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/protest/03-10/">web site</a> and will post information and updates as warranted. The campus's communication hotline (459-INFO) will also be activated as events warrant, and information will be provided to KZSC Radio (88.1 FM) for broadcast.</p><p>The university expects all faculty, staff, academic, and student employees to meet their normal obligations. Academic Personnel and Staff HR will be providing supervisors and managers with additional information regarding March 4.</p><p>UC Santa Cruz has a long history of passionate participation in the democratic process. We respect that tradition and reaffirm our commitment to the freedom of expression even as we anticipate potentially disruptive demonstrations on March 4. At the same time, we have an obligation to the entire campus community to preserve access and opportunity, including on March 4. </p><p>In closing, we refer you to the campus's <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles_community.asp">Principles of Community</a> and declare our belief that ultimately we all want the same thing: a strong and vital university with sufficient funding to provide affordable, high-quality education to the people of California.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal and Campus Provost David Kliger</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915fabe98072704601a012ff11c56b48"><name>3575</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Memorial for Benjamin Quaye</title><start-date>1267167600000</start-date><display-name>Memorial for Benjamin Quaye...</display-name><path>/2010/02/3575</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/02/3575</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339220405</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339220405</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Oakes College will be celebrating Benjamin Quaye's life and passions at a memorial service on Sunday, March 7.

<p>These grants will enable UCSC Lifelong Learners, now celebrating its 25th year, to make its successful program of lectures, courses, and interest groups available to a wider audience. It plans to increase its membership to 500 (from its current level of 400) and to expand its program. If it is successful, Lifelong Learners will become eligible for a permanent Osher endowment of $1 million.</p>
<p>"The grant and the chance to secure a permanent source of funding open up some very exciting opportunities for us," said Robert Franson, Lifelong Learners president. "We will be able to expand our program, develop new courses and discussion groups, and reach more people."</p>
<p>The Bernard Osher Foundation, headquartered in San Francisco, was founded in 1977 by Bernard Osher, a successful businessman and philanthropist.</p>
<p>With the receipt of the grant, UCSC Lifelong Learners becomes the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at UC Santa Cruz, joining a growing national network of Osher-sponsored institutes for older adults operating on the campuses of 119 colleges and universities in the United States. Six of the 10 UC campuses and 16 of the 23 California State Universities host Osher institutes.</p>
<p>UCSC Lifelong Learners, begun in 1984, is a community of men and women from diverse educational, occupational, and geographic backgrounds who are devoted to the pursuit of learning. Members enjoy shared campus experiences, spirited discussion, reading, and exploring new interests.</p>
<p>The group offers monthly meetings and lectures, several university-level short courses designed for mature adults, and 28 peer-led interest groups on subjects including creative writing, digital photography, books, philosophy, and dining out. Membership fees are used, after expenses, to fund scholarships for re-entry students to UCSC.</p>
<p>UCSC Emeritus professor John Dizikes, who has offered short courses for Lifelong Learners for a number of years, feels that the organization offers the perfect environment for teaching. It allows the teacher to have "a conversation with students," where there can be an interchange that is not based on grades, credits, or other academic considerations. He has found it very satisfying to teach in an environment where the only basis for being present is to learn.</p>
<p>Lifelong Learners is valuable because of the social opportunities it provides, said Jim Faris, 91, a founding member of the group.</p>
<p>"It's also important for stimulating the brain cells and continuing to learn, continuing to be interested in what's going on in life," said Faris, who worked as a film editor in Hollywood for 40 years and has run a film interest group for Lifelong Learners with his wife, Paula, for 19 years.</p>
<p>They've screened films including <i>Doubt, Dangerous Beauty, Chinatown,</i> and <i>Waking Ned Devine.</i> Afterward the members discuss issues brought up in the films.</p>
<p>"Learning, to me, is a process that's never-ending," Faris said.</p>

This morning, we were informed by campus officials that a student has come forward and claimed she and two others were responsible.  Whatever the intent of the authors of this act, it was a despicable expression of racial hatred, and we are outraged. It has no place in civilized society and it will not be tolerated - not on this particular campus, not on any University of California campus. A full investigation is underway by both campus and law enforcement officials. We support it. Appalling acts of this sort cannot go unpunished.</p><p>In the meantime, we will work in every way possible to ensure that all members of the UC San Diego community and the entire University system can learn and live in the safe and civil environment called for in the codes of conduct in place on each campus and facility. To the UCSD students and all others who have been confronted with this ugliness, and who are understandably traumatized by it, we extend both our sympathy and our pledge to root out racism whenever and wherever it arises on our campuses.</p><p>Now is the time for all members of the UC community to dig deep into their hearts and consciences and to reach out to one another with compassion and understanding. Now is the time to affirm that there is no place for any expression of racism.</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Community</audience><admin>UC Office of the President</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="9c3e51448072704601a012ff7318d85c"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><path>/2010/02/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/02/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282521583905</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282521583905</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="9c3e51448072704601a012ff7318d85c"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><path>/2010/02/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/02/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282521583905</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282521583905</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
