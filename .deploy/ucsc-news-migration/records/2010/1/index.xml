<p>Garth Illingworth, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, leads the survey team that used Hubble's new infrared camera, the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), to gather data in August 2009 that revealed the distant galaxies in a small patch of sky called the Ultra Deep Field. The Hubble Ultra Deep Field was imaged in visible light by the Advanced Camera for Surveys in 2004.</p>
<p>"With the rejuvenated Hubble and its new instruments, we are now entering uncharted territory that is ripe for new discoveries," Illingworth said. "The deepest-ever near-infrared view of the universe--the HUDF09 image--has now been combined with the deepest-ever optical image--the original HUDF taken in 2004--to push back the frontiers of the searches for the first galaxies and to explore their nature."</p>
<p>The deeper Hubble looks into space, the farther back in time it looks, because light takes billions of years to cross the observable universe. This makes Hubble a powerful "time machine" that allows astronomers to see galaxies as they were 13 billion years ago, just 600 million to 800 million years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>The new data from the Hubble's WFC3 have been analyzed by no less than five international teams of astronomers. A total of 15 papers have been submitted to date by astronomers worldwide. Some of these early results are being presented by Illingworth and other team members on Tuesday, January 6, at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>UCSC astronomer Rychard Bouwens, a member of Illingworth's team and leader of a paper on the striking properties of these galaxies, said that "the faintest galaxies are now showing signs of linkage to their origins from the first stars. They are so blue that they must be extremely deficient in heavy elements, thus representing a population that has nearly primordial characteristics."</p>
<p>James Dunlop of the University of Edinburgh agrees. "These galaxies could have roots stretching into an earlier population of stars. There must be a substantial component of galaxies beyond Hubble's detection limit," he said.</p>
<p>Three teams worked hard to find these new galaxies and did so in a burst of papers immediately after the data were released in September, soon followed by a fourth team, and later a fifth team. The existence of these newly found galaxies pushes back the time when galaxies began to form to before 500-600 million years after the Big Bang. This is good news for astronomers building the much more powerful James Webb Space Telescope (planned for launch in 2014), which will allow astronomers to study the detailed nature of primordial galaxies and discover many more even farther away. There should be a lot for Webb to hunt for.</p>
<p>The deep observations also demonstrate the progressive buildup of galaxies and provide further support for the hierarchical model of galaxy assembly, whereby small objects accrete mass, or merge, to form bigger objects over a smooth and steady but dramatic process of collision and agglomeration.</p>
<p>These newly found objects are crucial to understanding the evolutionary link between the birth of the first stars, the formation of the first galaxies, and the sequence of evolutionary events that resulted in the assembly of our Milky Way and the other "mature" elliptical and majestic spiral galaxies in today's universe.</p>
<p>The HUDF09 team also combined the new Hubble data with observations from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope to estimate the ages and masses of these primordial galaxies. "The masses are just 1 percent of those of the Milky Way," explained team member Ivo Labbe of the Carnegie Institute of Washington, leader of two papers on the data from the combined NASA Great Observatories. He further noted that "to our surprise, the results show that these galaxies at 700 million years after the Big Bang must have started forming stars hundreds of millions of years earlier, pushing back the time of the earliest star formation in the universe."</p>
<p>The results are gleaned from the HUDF09 observations, which are deep enough at near-infrared wavelengths to reveal galaxies at redshifts from z=7 to beyond redshift z=8. (The redshift value z is a measure of the stretching of the wavelength or "reddening" of starlight due to the expansion of space.) The clear detection of galaxies between z=7 and z=8.5 corresponds to "look-back times" of approximately 12.9 billion years to 13.1 billion years ago.</p>
<p>"This is about as far as we can go to do detailed science with the new HUDF09 image. This shows just how much the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is needed to unearth the secrets of the first galaxies," Illingworth said. The challenge is that spectroscopy is needed to provide definitive redshift values, but the objects are too faint for spectroscopic observations (until JWST is launched). Therefore, the redshifts are inferred by the galaxies' apparent colors through a now very well-established technique.</p>
<p>The teams are finding that the number of galaxies per unit of volume of space drops off smoothly with increasing distance, and the HUDF09 team has also found that the galaxies become surprisingly blue intrinsically. The ultra-blue galaxies are extreme examples of objects that appear so blue because they may be deficient in heavier elements, and as a result, quite free of the dust that reddens light through scattering.</p>
<p>A longstanding problem with these findings is that it still appears that these early galaxies did not put out enough radiation to "reionize" the early universe by stripping electrons off the neutral hydrogen that cooled after the Big Bang. This "reionization" event occurred between about 400 million and 900 million years after the Big Bang, but astronomers still don't know which sources of light caused it to happen. These new galaxies are being seen right in this important epoch in the evolution of the universe.</p>
<p>Perhaps the density of very faint galaxies below the current detection limit is so high that there may be enough of them to support reionization. Or there was an earlier wave of galaxy formation that decayed and then was "rebooted" by a second wave of galaxy formation. Or, possibly the early galaxies were extraordinarily efficient at reionizing the universe.</p>
<p>Due to these uncertainties, it is not clear what type of object or evolutionary process did the "heavy lifting" by ionizing the young universe. The calculations remain rather uncertain, and so galaxies may do more than currently expected, or astronomers may need to evoke other phenomena such as mini-quasars (active supermassive black holes in the cores of galaxies). Current estimates suggest, however, that quasars are even less likely than galaxies to be the cause of reionization. This is an enigma that still challenges astronomers and the very best telescopes.</p>
<p>"As we look back into the epoch of the first galaxies in the universe, from a redshift of 6 to a redshift of 8 and possibly beyond, these new observations indicate that we are likely seeing the end of reionization, and perhaps even into the reionization era, which is the last major phase transition of the gas in the universe," says Rogier Windhorst of Arizona State University. "Though the exact interpretation of these new results remains under debate, these new WFC3 data may provide an exciting new view of how galaxy formation proceeded during and at the end of the reionization era."</p>
<p>Hubble's WFC3/IR camera was able to make deep exposures to uncover new galaxies at roughly 40 times greater efficiency than its earlier infrared camera that was installed in 1997. The WFC3/IR brought new infrared technology to Hubble and accomplished in four days of observing what would have previously taken almost half a year for Hubble to do.</p>

It also provides great networking opportunities. The group aims to develop and maintain a collegial and professional relationship with all levels of campus administration. It is the only formally recognized organization of these administrators, who serve pivotal roles in the administrative, personnel, financial, and often public relations activities of the campus.</p><p>ABOG was originally organized in 1968 by laboratory business officers at UC Berkeley, UC San Francisco, and UC Irvine. Meeting annually to discuss common challenges and solutions, the group invited administrators from UC Office of the President and the other campuses to work together on common topics, challenges, and goals. For many years the group remained stable at 100 participants. In the beginning, everyone was a top administrator with laboratory responsibilities in a scientific department. Over the years department administrators from other disciplines have joined the group. Annual conferences held in the past five years have hosted 150-200 participants. Through the years ABOG has increased its visibility and credibility with UCOP, and the networking of members from the various campuses has been a valuable feature of the annual conference. </p><p>The UCSC Academic Business Officers Group (ABOG) was established in 2008. It is a collaborative organization, consisting of senior business officers from academic departments and research organizations, that gathers information about, provides input to, and comments on policies and practices affecting daily operations. Its primary purposes in meeting throughout the year are to inspire collaborative leadership and management, to reinforce networking, and to share information and strategies related to challenges we face in our commitment to providing high-quality service.</p><p>Members are selected by the ABOG executive board. Membership is open to non-represented staff employees classified as Assistant III-Supervisors and above. In order to be considered for inclusion as a member-at-large, interested staff are required to meet the following criteria:</p><p>1. You report directly to an academic department chair or director/head of an academic or research unit. </p><p>2. You have responsibilities for, or support the operation of, teaching and/or research units.</p><p>3. You have financial and/or supervisory responsibilities, as shown on your unit's organizational chart. </p><p>Membership selections are ongoing throughout the year.

Analysis of the stars in Andromeda's tidal streams and other components of its extended halo is yielding new insights into the processes involved in the formation and evolution of massive galaxies, said Puragra Guhathakurta, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p><p>Guhathakurta's team presented the latest results from studies of the newly discovered tidal streams on Thursday, January 7, at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C.</p><p>In the currently favored "Lambda Cold Dark Matter" paradigm of structure formation in the universe, the outer halos of large galaxies like our Milky Way galaxy and the neighboring Andromeda galaxy (also known as M31) are built up through the merger and dissolution of smaller "dwarf" satellite galaxies. "This process of galactic cannibalism is an integral part of the growth of galaxies," Guhathakurta said.  </p><p>The smooth, well-mixed population of halo stars in these large galaxies represents the aggregate of the dwarf galaxy victims of this cannibalism process, while the dwarf galaxies that are still intact as they orbit their large parent galaxy are the survivors of this process.</p><p>"The merging and dissolution of a dwarf galaxy typically lasts for a couple billion years, so one occasionally catches a large galaxy in the act of cannibalizing one of its dwarf galaxy satellites," Guhathakurta said. "The characteristic signature of such an event is a tidal stream: an enhancement in the density of stars, localized in space and moving as a coherent group through the parent galaxy." </p><p>Tidal streams are important because they represent a link between the victims and survivors of galactic cannibalism--an intermediate stage between the population of intact dwarf galaxies and the well-mixed stars dissolved in the halo.</p><p>The Andromeda galaxy is a unique test bed for studying the formation and evolution of a large galaxy, said Guhathakurta, who leads the Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo (SPLASH) collaboration, a large survey of red giant stars in Andromeda. "Our external vantage point gives us a global perspective of the galaxy, and yet the galaxy is close enough for us to obtain detailed measurements of individual red giant stars within it," he said. </p><p>In a project led by collaborators Mikito Tanaka and Masashi Chiba of Tohoku University, Japan, the researchers used the Subaru 8-meter telescope and Suprime-Cam camera to map the density of red giant stars in large portions of the Andromeda galaxy, including the hitherto uncharted north side. This led to the discovery of two tidal streams to the northwest (streams E and F) at projected distances of 60 and 100 kiloparsecs (200,000 and 300,000 light years) from Andromeda's center. The study also confirmed a few previously known streams, including the little-studied diffuse stream to the southwest (stream SW), which lies at a projected distance of 60 to 100 kiloparsecs (200,000 to 300,000 light years) from Andromeda's center.</p><p>The SPLASH team has followed up with a spectroscopic survey of several hundred red giant stars in Streams E, F, and SW, using the Keck II 10-meter telescope and DEIMOS spectrograph at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The spectrograph spreads out the light from each star into a spectrum, which allows astronomers to measure the velocity of the star and distinguish Andromeda red giant stars from foreground stars in the Milky Way. The spectral data confirmed the presence of coherent groups of Andromeda red giant stars moving with a common velocity.</p><p>One of the next steps will be to measure the detailed chemical properties of red giant stars in these newly discovered tidal streams in Andromeda. Comparing the chemical properties of tidal streams, intact dwarf satellites, and the smooth halo will be of particular significance, Guhathakurta said.</p><p>Complex elements such as iron, magnesium, and calcium in the outer layers of a red giant star were produced within previous generations of massive stars that ended their lives as supernova explosions, spewing out newly forged elements into the interstellar medium. Thus, the fraction of complex elements found in stars indicates the degree to which the host galaxy's gas (the raw material from which new stars are formed) was enriched by supernova explosions from successive generations of massive stars. </p><p>"Massive galaxies like the Milky Way and Andromeda are very effective at recycling chemicals and therefore contain stars like our Sun that are relatively rich in complex elements--rich enough for rocky planets to have formed and for those planets to contain complex molecules such as proteins," Guhathakurta said.</p><p>Dwarf galaxies are less effective at recycling chemicals than massive galaxies. This is partly because the weaker gravity of a dwarf galaxy makes it harder for it to retain the chemically enriched gas that is blown out of massive stars during supernova explosions.  As a result, stars in dwarf galaxies are more anemic (have a smaller fraction of complex elements) than those in the interior of massive galaxies. Moreover, the action of merging with a larger galaxy causes a dwarf galaxy to lose its gas, breaking the chemical cycle altogether. </p><p>"Dwarf galaxy cannibalism victims have had less time to recycle their chemicals than dwarf galaxy survivors, and this should be reflected as a difference between their chemical properties," Guhathakurta said. "Tidal streams should be somewhere between the victims and the survivors in terms of their chemical properties."</p><p>At the present time, detailed studies of the chemical properties of tidal streams, intact dwarf satellites, and smooth stellar halos are possible only in the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies and their immediate surroundings. Existing telescopes and instruments are simply not powerful enough for astronomers to carry out such studies in more distant galaxies. This situation will improve greatly with the advent of the planned Thirty Meter Telescope later in this decade, Guhathakurta said.</p><p>In addition to the UCSC and Tohoku University researchers, this study involved SPLASH collaboration team members at the University of Virginia, UC Irvine, University of Massachusetts, Yale University, University of Washington, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, Columbia University, NASA's Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), and California Institute of Technology. This research was supported by the National Science Foundation and NASA/STScI. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915ef17f8072704601a012ff7258e33a"><name>3463</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: George Kane</title><summary>George Kane--who taught fine printing and book arts classes for 27 years as a lecturer at the Cowell Press--died on November 28, 2009 of natural causes at the age of 96.</summary><description>George Kane--who taught fine printing and book arts classes for 27 years as a lecturer at the Cowell Press--died on November 28, 2009 of natural causes at the age of 96.</description><start-date>1262761200000</start-date><display-name>In Memoriam: George Kane...</display-name><path>/2010/01/3463</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/01/3463</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339172688</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339172688</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>George Kane--who taught fine printing and book arts classes for 27 years as a lecturer at the Cowell Press--died on November 28, 2009 of natural causes at the age of 96.

<p>That's the key question posed by "Another Look: Women Writers Re-Vision History"-the winter installment of UCSC's annual Living Writers Series.</p>
<p>Each quarter, the Humanities Division's literary series brings eight to 10 visiting authors and poets to campus to provide an in-depth look into the world of the working writer.</p>
<p>Beginning on January 13 and running through March 10, the spotlight will be on historical fiction and poetry written by nine award-winning, female authors.</p>
<p>"We are particularly interested in the ways women writers--who have not participated in the writing of history until very recently--might look at history," said associate literature professor Micah Perks, codirector of the UCSC Creative Writing Program with her colleague Karen Yamashita.</p>
<p>Perks noted that the term "re-vision history" in the series title is borrowed from a classic essay by renowned poet and feminist Adrienne Rich "about the way women must give birth to their own literary visions."</p>
<p>"Because women have not been the primary writers of history, they have played limited roles in official historical narratives," Perks said.</p>
<p>The series lineup includes Rebecca Goldstein, winner of a MacArthur "genius" award; and Karen Joy Fowler, author of <em>The Jane Austen Book Club</em>, which spent 13 weeks on the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers list.</p>
<p>Other highlights include Judith Freeman, whose fifth work of fiction, <em>Red Water</em>, was named one of the 100 best books of 2002 by the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>; and Nina Revoyr, whose novel, <em>The Age of Dreaming</em>, was a finalist for the 2008 Los Angeles Times Book Prize.</p>
<p><em>Los Angeles Magazine</em> recently described Revoyr "as fast becoming one of the city's finest chroniclers and myth-makers."</p>
<p>The series kicks off on January 13 with Ana Menendez, the daughter of Cuban exiles, and now a prizewinning columnist for <em>The Miami Herald</em>. Menendez's short story collection <em>In Cuba I Was a German Shepherd</em> was a 2001 New York Times Notable Book of the Year.</p>
<p>"These women have all written historical fiction, but all their writing is different in very interesting ways," said Perks. "For example, Ana Menendez focused on the women around Che Guevara, Karen Joy Fowler wrote about a woman's baseball league during World War II, and Judith Freeman writes from the point of view of the wives of a Mormon leader accused of leading a massacre."</p>
<p>"On the other hand, many of these women writers tend to write from multiple perspectives or from the perspective of outsiders, and they often move back and forth in time, stressing the connections between contemporary women and women in the past," Perks added.</p>
<p>The lecture/readings will take place on Wednesdays at 5 p.m. in the UCSC Humanities Lecture Hall. All events are free and open to the public. Books by the visiting writers will be available for purchase at each event, courtesy of the Bay Tree Bookstore.</p>

<p>Dear UC Santa Cruz Student:</p>

<p>I'm delighted that you are pursuing your educational goals at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In the years to come, I'm confident that you and your family will consider your time here to have been a very sound investment in your future.</p>

<p>As you and your family know first-hand, state reductions in support for public higher education have led to increased fees that are straining the ability of some to continue their education. That is true at UC Santa Cruz, on other UC campuses, and on California State University campuses as well.</p>

<p>While I want to assure you that I and other UC representatives continue to make the case for additional state support for our 10-campus system to ensure we continue to be the top public research university in the world, I am writing for another very important reason.</p>

<p>I write today to make certain you know of the steps that the UC system has taken in recent months that will help many current students finance a UCSC education. I urge you to share this letter with parents or other family members.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the 2010-11 year, UC's Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan will be expanded to include eligible resident undergraduates with family incomes up to $70,000. Under the higher income ceiling, California residents with financial need and family incomes of $70,000 or below are assured that they will receive gift assistance that will, at a minimum, cover all their mandatory systemwide fees during the academic year.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Other students with financial need will have half of the 2010-11 fee increase covered if their parents' income falls below $120,000 - an increase in the cap from $100,000 in prior years. Middle-income families also will continue to benefit from federal higher education tax credits in 2010.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>As UC historically has done, 33 percent of the revenue generated from the approved fee increases will be set aside to mitigate the impact of higher fees and other costs on undergraduate students with financial need.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>This "return-to-aid" practice, combined with 2009-10 increases in Cal Grants, federal Pell Grants and federal tuition tax credits will provide enough additional resources to cover the full amount of the fee increases already approved for 2009-10, and the 2009-10 mid-year increase, for nearly three-quarters of UC students with family incomes below $180,000.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>To ensure you get all the financial aid you're entitled to, you need to do your part.</p>

<p>First, submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) before March 2, 2010. I urge every UC Santa Cruz student, regardless of family income, to complete this free online application. It is the gateway to all financial aid, including most UCSC scholarships and low-interest student and parent loans.</p>

<p>Also, families are encouraged to take full advantage of the American Opportunity Tax Credit for couples with adjusted gross incomes of up to $180,000 ($90,000 for single filers). This credit will directly reduce your tax bill, providing up to $2,500 to help cover your college expenses.</p>

<p>Links to the FAFSA application, the IRS page on college tax credits, and UC's Blue &amp; Gold information can all be found on a special <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/payingforucsc/">Paying for UCSC</a> web site our campus has created for students and families.</p>

<p>The page also has a link to the campus's Financial Aid and Scholarship Office web site. If you have questions or just need help, please do not hesitate to phone, email, or just visit the office.</p>

<p>Even during these challenging financial times, you can earn your UCSC degree. And our Financial Aid and Scholarship staff are here to help.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>George R. Blumenthal<br/>
</p>
<p>Chancellor, University of California, Santa Cruz</p>

The three-day event will include panel discussions on graduate school and careers in physics, research talks, laboratory tours, and discussions on women in physics.</p><p>"It's a great way to build networks of support, providing us with the opportunity to share advice and information," said Melinda Soares, a UCSC physics major who helped organize the conference. "The conference is geared toward exposing the various career opportunities available in the field of physics, which is a very broad discipline."</p><p>Soares, a junior, attended the conference last year at the University of Southern California. She and two other physics students, Jessica Missaghian and Cory Dominguez, took the lead in organizing the conference at UCSC this year, with help from physics professors David Belanger, Michael Dine, and others. The UCSC conference will be held simultaneously with other Women in Physics conferences at Ohio State University, Duke University, and Yale University.</p><p>Belanger, chair of the physics department, said the organizers expect 75 to 100 students to attend. "They will establish important contacts that will help them become successful in their future graduate and professional careers in a field in which women are still underrepresented," he said.</p><p>In the United States, although about 50 percent of high school physics students are girls, women earn less than 25 percent of the bachelor's degrees in physics and less than 20 percent of Ph.D. degrees in physics. Increasing the retention of women in the academic "pipeline" leading to advanced degrees in physics has been a concern for national science organizations. </p><p>"In my graduating class at UCSC, there are four other women. So it's refreshing to see 100 women together, all participating in interesting physics research," Soares said.  </p><p>Sponsors of the conference include the UCSC Department of Physics, Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, Jack Baskin School of Engineering, Office of Research, Division of Graduate Studies, EEO/Affirmative Action Office, and the Society of Physics Students. </p><p>Additional information is available on the <a href="http://dave.ucsc.edu/wipconf/">conference web site</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915f07088072704601a012ffa6d12afb"><name>3472</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Cassini data show Enceladus in motion</title><summary>Blobs of warm ice that periodically rise to the surface and churn the icy crust on Saturn's moon Enceladus explain the quirky heat behavior and intriguing surface of the moon's south polar region.</summary><author>Jia-Rui Cook, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, jia-rui.c.cook@jpl.nasa.gov</author><keywords>Francis Nimmo, Enceladus</keywords><description>Blobs of warm ice that periodically rise to the surface and churn the icy crust on Saturn's moon Enceladus explain the quirky heat behavior and intriguing surface of the moon's south polar region.</description><start-date>1263193200000</start-date><display-name>Cassini data show Enceladus...</display-name><path>/2010/01/3472</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/01/3472</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339178197</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339178197</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/01/images/enceladus_350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/01/images/enceladus_350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>enceladus_350.jpg</name><file-size>78830</file-size><width>350</width><height>505</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The surface of Enceladus, seen in this mosaic image captured by the Cassini spacecraft, is replete with fractures, folds, and ridges--all hallmarks of remarkable tectonic activity for a relatively small world.

While the latest paper, published online January 10, doesn't link the churning and resurfacing directly to the formation of fissures and jets, it does fill in some of the blanks in the region's history.</p><p>"This episodic model helps to solve one of the most perplexing mysteries of Enceladus," said Bob Pappalardo, Cassini project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, of the research done by his colleagues. "Why is the south polar surface so young? How could this amount of heat be pumped out at the moon's south pole? This idea assembles the pieces of the puzzle."</p><p>About four years ago, Cassini's composite infrared spectrometer instrument detected a heat flow in the south polar region of at least 6 gigawatts, the equivalent of at least a dozen electric power plants. This is at least three times as much heat as an average region of Earth of similar area would produce, despite Enceladus' small size. The region was also later found by Cassini's ion and neutral mass spectrometer instrument to be swiftly expelling argon, which comes from rocks decaying radioactively and has a well-known rate of decay.</p><p>Calculations told scientists it would be impossible for Enceladus to have continually produced heat and gas at this rate. Tidal movement--the pull and push from Saturn as Enceladus moves around the planet--cannot explain the release of so much energy.</p><p>The surface ages of different regions of Enceladus also show great diversity. Heavily cratered plains in the northern part of the moon appear to be as old as 4.2 billion years, while a region near the equator known as Sarandib Planitia is between 170 million and 3.7 billion years old. The south polar area, however, appears to be less than 100 million years old, possibly as young as 500,000 years.</p><p>Craig O'Neill of Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, and Nimmo, who was partially funded by the NASA Outer Planets Research program, adapted a model that O'Neill had developed for the convection of Earth's crust. For Enceladus, which has a surface completely covered in cold ice that is fractured by the tug of Saturn's gravitational pull, the scientists stiffened up the crust. They picked a strength somewhere between that of the malleable tectonic plates on Earth and the rigid plates of Venus, which are so strong, it appears they never get sucked down into the interior. </p><p>Their model showed that heat building up from the interior of Enceladus could be released in episodic bubbles of warm, light ice rising to the surface, akin to the rising blobs of heated wax in a lava lamp. The rise of the warm bubbles would send cold, heavier ice down into the interior. (Warm is, of course, relative. Nimmo said the bubbles are probably just below freezing, which is 273 degrees Kelvin or 32 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas the surface is a frigid 80 degrees Kelvin or -316 degrees Fahrenheit.) </p><p>The model fits the activity on Enceladus when the churning and resurfacing periods are assumed to last about 10 million years, and the quiet periods, when the surface ice is undisturbed, last about 100 million to two billion years. Their model suggests the active periods have occurred only 1 to 10 percent of the time that Enceladus has existed and have recycled 10 to 40 percent of the surface. The active area around Enceladus's south pole is about 10 percent of its surface.</p><p>The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. JPL, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

We are looking for volunteers to share their UCSC experiences. </p><p>Were you at your high school or community college when you first talked with someone about UCSC? Many of our current students are at UCSC today because they met someone who made him/herself available, answered their questions, and identified a pathway to the university. Now the Office of Admissions would like you to be that ambassador for students. </p><p>During spring break 2010, March 22-26, the Office of Admissions will sponsor the Taking UCSC Home program. As a volunteer Student Ambassador for UC Santa Cruz, you will visit your former high school or community college to present information about UC Santa Cruz to the students there, especially to those who have been admitted for fall 2010. You will be trained in how to make a UCSC presentation and will receive publications and information about the university to share with the students; but you will mostly be sharing your personal academic and social experiences of UC Santa Cruz. </p><p>If you are interested in participating, please apply or update your information at admissions.ucsc.edu/volunteers by January 31, 2010. If selected, Student Ambassadors would need to attend a mandatory training session on Saturday, February 6.</p><p>If you have previously participated in Taking UCSC Home as a Student Ambassador for the Office of Admissions, please log in under "existing volunteers login here" with the same e-mail address and graduation month and year that you used when you registered. Please click the link "Apply for Taking UCSC Home 2010" to re-apply to the Taking UCSC Home program. If necessary, update your personal information as well. </p><p>If you have never participated in the Taking UCSC Home program and are interested in applying, please fill out the "Create a new volunteer profile" form. </p><p>All Student Ambassadors must be in good academic and judicial standing at UCSC, so you should be aware that we will verify this information.</p><p> </p><p>If you would like to volunteer but cannot participate in Taking UCSC Home, we have another opportunity: Spring Spotlight, April 2-10, 2010. Volunteers are needed for this event to greet tour guests and connect with admitted students and their families. You may also sign up for this event at admissions.ucsc.edu/volunteers.

<p>With a theme of "Inspiring Innovation," this year's event features keynote speakers Dan Roam (Merrill '88) and Ezequiel Olvera Jr. (Oakes '07).</p>
<p>Roam is the founder of <a href="http://www.digitalroam.com/">Digital Roam</a>, a consulting firm that helps major companies solve complex problems through the art of visual thinking.</p>
<p>His international bestselling book, <em>The Back of the Napkin: Solving Problems and Selling Ideas with Pictures</em>, was <em>Business Week</em>'s #1 innovation book of 2008, and <em>The Financial Times</em>' #3 business book of the year.</p>
<p>Roam's "<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/danroam/healthcare-napkins-all" title="Healthcare Napkins All">American Health Care on the Back of a Napkin</a>" was also the winner of SlideShare's "World's Best Presentation" contest in 2009.</p>
<p>Roam notes that due to his educational experience at UCSC, he has spent his career working with influential leaders and organizations around the world.</p>
<p>"They invite me in because I have a unique view of how people can look at problems, see the challenges, and imagine innovative solutions," says Roam.</p>
<p>"I have that unique view for a very simple reason-because UC Santa Cruz encouraged me to pursue an unconventional education: fine art and hard science tempered with business."</p>
<p>"If it weren't for the student scholarship support I received as an undergraduate at UCSC, my vision would never have come to light," Roam adds.</p>
<p>Olvera is a young entrepreneur who creatively financed his college education through a gumball and vending machine business he started as a teenager.</p>
<p>While at UCSC, he developed a plan to turn this childhood entrepreneurial business into the Gumball Foundation--a self-sustaining organization that in 2008 began awarding scholarships to underprivileged students from his community who want to pursue higher education.</p>
<p>"The value of a UCSC education is that it helps students become socially, environmentally, and culturally conscientious individuals," says Olvera. "The value of a student scholarship is that it gives students the opportunity to follow their dreams and find their place in the world."</p>
<p>Shellye Archambeau, CEO of Silicon Valley's <a href="http://www.metricstream.com/">MetricStream</a>, will serve as master of ceremonies for the dinner. Archambeau was named one of the 50 Most Important African Americans in Technology for 2009 by eAccess Corp, and one of the Top Women of Influence by the <em>Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal</em> in 2008.</p>
<p>Last year's sold-out Scholarship Benefit Dinner raised more than $165,000 for UCSC undergraduate scholarships, a result Chancellor George Blumenthal described as "especially gratifying" given the historic economic downturn.</p>
<p>He noted that "more than a third of our students are the first in their family to attend college, and many are from disadvantaged families," adding, "scholarship support makes a huge difference for these students and their families."</p>

<p>Due to the reduction in state support for the University of California, fees for an undergraduate California resident are approximately $8,700 for 2009-10 and scheduled to increase in the coming year. Nearly two-thirds of UC undergraduates received some form of financial assistance in the past academic year.</p>
<p>More students than ever before now need financial assistance to enable them to attend the university, and in recent years, low-income families have been particularly hard-hit by increased tuition costs.</p>

Robb as one of the best books it reviewed in 2009.</p>
<p><em>Choice</em> magazine selected only 652 titles as an "Outstanding Academic Title" from more than 7,000 the magazine reviewed last year, out of 25,000 books submitted for review. <em>Choice</em> is published by the Association of College &amp; Research Libraries, and reaches 35,000 academic librarians and faculty in nearly every undergraduate college and university library in the United States.</p>
<p>"It took us over seven years to conduct the research for the book. It's nice to have been selected by <em>Choice</em> as one of their outstanding academic titles for the year," Fairlie said.</p>
<p><em>Race and Entrepreneurial Success</em> is the first comprehensive examination of why some racial groups succeed in business while others struggle. Fairlie and Robb write that business ownership has been the ticket to a higher standard of living for millions of entrepreneurs, but persistent racial disparities hamper would-be African-American business owners.</p>
<p>The writers found that African-Americans don't get the same boost from self-employment that Asians and whites enjoy, largely because they lack financial capital, education, and opportunities to work in a family-owned business before setting out on their own.</p>
<p><em>Choice</em> also selected <em>Be Always Converted: An American Poetics</em> (Harvard University Press) by literature professor Rob Wilson as an outstanding academic title for 2009.</p>

Numbers released today by UC's Office of the President showed that UC Santa Cruz attracted 34,630 applications - the most ever for the campus - from high school seniors and transfer students during the university's November "priority" filing period.</p>

"The interest we received from prospective undergraduates for next fall is very gratifying and speaks to the quality of UCSC's people and programs," said Michelle Whittingham, UCSC's associate vice chancellor of enrollment management and director of admissions. "Not only did interest from high school seniors increase, but we experienced a very large surge from prospective transfer students."<br/>
<br/>
<p>Last year, UCSC received 32,847 applications from prospective undergraduates: 27,231 from prospective freshmen and 5,616 from prospective transfer students. This year's undergraduate total of 34,630 - 5.4 percent more than applied a year earlier - includes applications from 27,623 prospective freshmen and 7,007 prospective transfer students.</p>
<p>The fall 2010 applications to UCSC reflected especially strong interest from transfer students. The 7,007 transfer students who applied were 24.8 percent more than applied a year earlier. The one-year gain at UCSC outpaced a UC systemwide increase that averaged 17.5 percent.</p>
<p>Whittingham said UCSC officials are particularly pleased that applications from prospective transfer students soared this year. "Given the financial challenges faced by applicants and their families, our Admissions Office and others on the UCSC campus made an extra effort to increase our outreach to prospective transfer students," she said. "We're very pleased that these students are interested in completing their undergraduate education at UCSC."</p>
<p>Because of uncertain state support, UCSC's fall 2010 enrollment targets have not yet been finalized. But campus officials have set a preliminary goal of enrolling 4,150 new undergraduates: 3,200 freshmen and 950 transfer students. This past fall, UCSC enrolled 4,086 new undergraduates: 3,214 freshmen and 872 transfer students.</p>
<p>Approximately one-third of the prospective freshmen applied to UCSC with an undeclared major. Applications from prospective freshmen who did declare were similar to last year's numbers in Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences, but increased in the two other academic divisions: Engineering and Physical &amp; Biological Sciences. (Applications from prospective transfer students were up in all five academic divisions.)</p>
<p>"Since our preliminary frosh enrollment target is essentially the same as it was for this past fall, the fact that we received more applications from that group will make freshman admission for fall 2010 more competitive," Whittingham said.</p>
<p>Among California freshman applications to UCSC, increases were realized in all of the underrepresented ethnic groups: African American, from 986 last year to 1,105 this year, a 12.1 percent increase; American Indian, from 207 last year to 267 this year, a 29 percent increase; and Chicano/Latino, from 5,366 last year to 5,843 this year, an 8.9 percent increase.</p>
<p>In transfer-student applications from California's Community Colleges, the increases from underrepresented groups were even larger: African American, from 166 last year to 243 this year, a 46 percent increase; American Indian, from 59 last year to 76 this year, a 29 percent increase; and Chicano/Latino, from 851 last year to 1,173 this year, a 38 percent increase.</p>
<p>"We are very excited about these increases, especially among transfer students coming from the state's community colleges," Whittingham said. "It's important that the ethnic diversity of UCSC's students more closely mirror the state we serve."</p>
<p>Undergraduate applicants to UCSC will be notified of admission decisions beginning on March 15. Admitted freshmen will have until May 1 to file a "statement of intent to register," indicating their intention to enroll at UC Santa Cruz. The deadline for transfer students is June 1.</p>

I hope that your break was restful and that you return to campus ready to resume your roles in UCSC's teaching, learning, research, and public service endeavors.</p><p>I am greatly encouraged by Governor Schwarzenegger's statement on Wednesday in support of substantially increased funding for higher education in California. His proposal to invest significantly more in higher education than in prisons would reverse a devastating trend in UC and CSU funding and reflects a return to the values that shaped California's history of innovation. Of course, the budget process in California is complex, and significant challenges remain, but I welcome the governor's strong endorsement of the value of higher education to the people of California.</p><p>In the short term, however, the state must contend with a budget shortfall of approximately $20 billion. We will learn more in the next few days about how the governor intends to address that deficit, and I promise to keep you apprised of developments and how those developments will affect us at UCSC.</p><p>At this time, I must also announce that David Kliger has decided to step down from his post as Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor, effective June 30, 2010. As my closest colleague, Dave has been an invaluable asset to me for more than three years. He has provided truly exceptional service to the campus as Campus Provost/EVC for nearly five years, as Dean for 15 years, and before that as both Divisional Senate Chair and Department Chair. I will miss his candor, his wisdom, and his tireless dedication to UC Santa Cruz. After consulting with the Senate leadership, I have decided to begin an immediate search for Dave's replacement.</p><p>There is much work to do, and Dave will continue, with my full support, to oversee the 2010-2011 budget-planning process. I am grateful that we will benefit from Dave's leadership this winter and spring, because even as we anticipate greater state support for the university in coming years, there is little doubt that difficult decisions will have to be made in the next few months. As we move forward, we must focus on the university's core mission of teaching, research, and public service. With fewer dollars in our base budget, it is critical that we allocate them wisely. As I mentioned, we will update you on new developments as they occur, and I encourage you to share your thoughts with me. As always, feel free to write me at chancellor@ucsc.edu.</p><p>Finally, let us not lose sight of the many reasons we have to feel proud of our campus. Last month, four undergraduates attended the international climate-change talks in Copenhagen, and our Stevenson College/Philosophy Department ethics team won the California Regional Ethics Bowl, setting the stage for them to compete nationally this spring. Just this week, campus astronomers announced the discovery of the most distant galaxies ever seen. Our biologists have helped pioneer marine-reserve policies that are now being used as a model in other parts of the world. And thanks to the generous support of its many fans, Shakespeare Santa Cruz will be back this summer with a robust lineup of three shows exploring the theme of love.</p><p>The optimistic spirit of UC Santa Cruz is alive and well, and as you head into a busy quarter, I encourage you to reflect on what you know and love about the campus. What first drew you to UCSC? What captivates you today? As you reconnect with that pride, I encourage you to have a conversation about UCSC with a friend, a neighbor, a relative, or a colleague. The story of UCSC is long and worthy. And there is so much more to come!</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>Campus Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915f22608072704601a012ffc2d6e392"><name>3488</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Update on Budget Planning from Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger</title><summary>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger discusses campus budget planning.</summary><keywords>kliger, plan, budget, white paper, strategic</keywords><description>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger discusses campus budget planning.</description><start-date>1264057200000</start-date><display-name>Update on Budget Planning...</display-name><path>/2010/01/3488</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/01/3488</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339185172</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339185172</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>

<p>The Tornado Warning for Santa Cruz County has expired, however, the potential for severe thunderstorms still exists. Immediately seek shelter inside a building in the event of such storm activity.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service has issued several warnings and advisories which can be viewed at the <a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=Santa+Cruz&amp;state=CA&amp;site=MTR&amp;textField1=36.9899&amp;textField2=-122.06">forecast page for campus</a>.</p>

<p>Whenever possible during high winds, pedestrians should avoid trails through densely wooded areas, walking instead through more open areas even if the route is slightly longer. Healthy branches can still break and fall during windstorms, posing a potentially serious hazard to pedestrians.</p>
<p><strong>January 20, 2010 at 2:15 PM</strong></p>
<p>The National Weather Service has issued a <a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=CAZ529&amp;warncounty=CAC087&amp;firewxzone=CAZ529&amp;local_place1=Santa+Cruz+CA&amp;product1=Tornado+Warning">Tornado Warning</a> for Santa Cruz County and Santa Clara County until 2:30 PM. Heavy hail may also occur.</p>
<p>The safest place to be during a tornado is in a basement. Get under a Workbench or other piece of sturdy furniture. If no basement is Available...seek shelter on the lowest floor of the building in aninterior hallway or room such as a closet. Use blankets or pillows to cover your body and always stay away from windows.</p>
<p>If in mobile homes or vehicles...evacuate them and get inside a substantial shelter. If no shelter is available...lie flat in the nearest ditch or other low spot and cover your head with your hands.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915f36a88072704601a012ff04a1675d"><name>3501</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>EVC Kliger: Campus budget issues and academic planning</title><summary>EVC/Campus Provost David Kliger discusses the campus's budget-planning process.</summary><description>EVC/Campus Provost David Kliger discusses the campus's budget-planning process.</description><start-date>1264057200000</start-date><display-name>EVC Kliger: Campus budget...</display-name><path>/2010/01/3501</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/01/3501</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339190381</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339190381</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><h4>Budget cutting as a component of strategic planning</h4></p><p>It is clear in talking to people on campus that most of us are worried about the effects of budget cuts we have taken over the last two years, as well as about what additional cuts may be on the way in the coming years.  It is natural that people focus mainly on the impacts on their own programs.  I share here the perspective of the central administration, where we need to focus on the overall health of the campus and not only the effects on individual programs.  It is thus worth thinking about how our approach to budget cutting fits with the strategic planning efforts that have gone on over the last several years.</p><p>Since I took on the role of Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor in 2005, I have thought a lot about how to advance the quality of UC Santa Cruz in both research and education.  The first step in thinking about this is to be clear about the mission of the university.  My view is that the role of a public university is to serve society.  We do that primarily (though not exclusively) through educating future generations of citizens and through research that advances the quality of life for citizens.  </p><p>We have the responsibility to expose our students to different modes of thinking so that they become independent thinkers.  Our science and engineering majors need to learn about the social impacts of scientific studies and their applications.  Our arts, social science, and humanities students need to understand scientific concepts that will affect the world.  This perspective is, I think, reflected in the faculty's formulation of the new campus General Education requirements.  To be effective in providing this type of education for our students, we need a campus that has strong educational programs across all of our disciplines.</p><p>To advance that goal, I concentrated on two things when I first became CPEVC.  The first was to focus on moving more of the resources of the campus toward the academic divisions in order to provide them with resources to create the strongest academic programs they could with the resources available to us.  The second was to develop a campus-wide academic plan that mapped out how we could most productively invest in academic programs as the campus grew in enrollment and, therefore, faculty.</p><p><h4>Investment in academic programs</h4></p><p>In the first area, since becoming CPEVC in 2005-06, I allocated funding and support for 66 new faculty FTE, restored previously withheld instruction and research support, committed over $20 million for start-up costs associated with new faculty appointments, and created new teaching assistant positions in response to growth in our undergraduate student population.  Despite the impact of budget cuts and the concomitant slow-down in the recruitment of new faculty, UCSC hired 135 new faculty between 2005-06 and the start of this fiscal year.  After taking into account retirements and other separations, the number of filled faculty positions has grown from 512 in 2005-06 to over 550 in 2009-10.  </p><p>We have increased support for our graduate students by allocating additional funds for graduate student fellowships, providing funding for the Disciplinary Communications Initiative, and increasing funding for the library collection.  We have also invested in many promising new research initiatives, and this fiscal year I bolstered the flexible funding available to the divisions by allocating overhead to them generated on private grants that have originating sources fully funded by the federal government.  Central campus resources totaling over $20 million were provided to support the construction of the Digital Arts Facility, McHenry Library Addition, and the Biomedical Science Building.  We have also sought to make employment at UCSC more affordable to our faculty by building homes at Ranch View Terrace and creating the low-interest option supplemental home loan program.      </p><p>The importance of investing in academic programs should be obvious.  They directly support expression of the reason for the existence of the university: teaching and research.  To understand how such investment can be maximally productive, however, we need to be clear about how resources are most effectively used in making decisions at the campus level.</p><p><h4>Development of a campus strategic academic plan</h4></p><p>While the campus had for many years regularly obtained planning documents from academic departments and divisions, these had not been integrated into a campus-wide academic plan, one that could reveal how allocations of the limited resources available (even when we were in a growth mode) are made strategically to create strength across the campus and have maximum overall impact.  Making it clear to the public where UCSC is headed is also critically important to increasing private gift support for individual programs and the campus as a whole.  We thus engaged in the development of a strategic academic plan for the campus.  </p><p>The plan began with very high-level assumptions about the distribution of faculty positions across the existing five academic divisions.  These assumptions drew on comparisons with comparable institutions.  The result was a model of how faculty could be balanced across the divisions so that each division would have the ability to develop strong academic programs.  Previous attempts to give a campus-level view of the productivity of academic programs focused entirely on student credit hours as a measure of faculty productivity.  That approach seemed to me to be inappropriate for a research university whose function involved both the production of new knowledge, as well as the dissemination of knowledge to students.  </p><p>Instead, we took a more nuanced view of how to generate divisional sizes in a way that could create strong research profiles, as well as meet the curricular needs of students.  We looked at faculty distributions on other campuses, as well as at the particular interests and history of UCSC. After much discussion, we proposed what percentage of the faculty should be affiliated with each of the five existing divisions.  There was no effort in this process to determine within these broad divisional categories distributions to individual programs.  The assumption has been that divisions would make their own decisions, perhaps in collaboration with other divisions, on how to balance their anticipated resources across programs to achieve the best balance of productivity.</p><p>Once we established an estimate of how big (in terms of faculty positions) each division would ultimately be after anticipated enrollment growth, we asked deans to develop realistic divisional plans given the faculty resources they could anticipate.  They began, appropriately, with plans from every department to create integrated academic divisional plans.  We asked each program to assess where their field was heading, what their strengths were in terms of contributing to their field, and how they should direct growth resources to maximize their contributions in the future.  In creating a divisional plan, deans were asked to maximize the impacts of new resources across the entire division.</p><p>Once the deans submitted plans from the academic divisions, Vice Provost of Academic Affairs Alison Galloway and I reviewed the individual plans looking for patterns across divisions that could create a more integrated campus plan that would support the ambitions of our faculty.  VPAA Galloway looked at the plans in terms of how department goals could be categorized into a small number of priorities.  I looked at them in terms of how campus strengths and ambitions could contribute to the needs of society in both research and teaching.  These perspectives were put together in the then-draft strategic vision plan for the campus that could be realized at the end of an anticipated period of enrollment growth.  The <a href="http://planning.ucsc.edu/acadplan/docs/AcadPlan.Feb08.pdf">final plan</a> is available on the web.   </p><p>This high-level vision led to an <a href="http://planning.ucsc.edu/acadplan/docs/ActionPlan.Sep08.pdf">implementation plan</a> that assigned roles to each principal officer in order to make the vision a reality.  It also prompted the development of a plan to monitor a variety of metrics to follow our progress.</p><p>In deciding to allocate new resources to academic divisions under the campus plan, we looked, in part, at how close each division was to the long-term size projected for it.  In the previous decade, different divisions had grown at very different rates, resulting in substantial growth for some and near stagnation for others.  I sought to compensate for this trend by making differential allocations that would bring the divisions more in line with the direction of the campus academic plan. </p><p><h4>Impacts of change in budget climate on strategic planning</h4></p><p>These plans were created at a time when we were expecting substantial growth in enrollment and in new state resources for the campus.  However, two years ago we began facing a very different situation: one in which no new state funds were provided for increases in enrollment, and our existing budgets were substantially reduced due to a state budget crisis.  In effect, we lost both the new funds anticipated for enrollment growth and had less state funding to support the programs and students that we already had.  </p><p>The approach we took for the first round of budget cuts was to protect academic programs, health and safety functions, informational technology, and University Relations by assigning them a much smaller cut than administrative functions.  This round of cuts resulted in cuts to institutional and academic support units ranging from 1 percent to 5 percent and a direct cut to academic units of about 1 percent.  In dollar terms, a $2.9 million reduction was allocated to support units and $1 million was allocated to academic units.</p><p>This approach of protecting the core academic functions of instruction and research by making smaller cuts to academic units seemed appropriate because we wanted to continue to accommodate the needs of existing faculty and students.  However, it is an approach that cannot be sustained in the long run.  There are critical administrative support functions that are necessary for campus operations and the effective support of core academic functions.   At some point, cutting administrative support functions has serious negative impacts on core academic functions (consider how few academics we could retain on campus if we could not get the payroll out in a timely manner).  </p><p>This was particularly problematic since a series of budget cuts and differential investments over a decade or more resulted in some administrative programs being stretched very thin, leaving them less able to absorb additional cuts.  These services are a necessary part of UCSC's future, and we must make campus planning decisions with an eye on creating a sustainable model for UCSC's future excellence.  Thus, when we had to take a second round of large budget cuts this past year, we needed a different approach to assigning budget cuts.  </p><p>The approach we took for 2009-10 was to try to assess the impact to all campus functions of cuts of various sizes for each academic and academic support division on campus.  We asked each principal officer to create scenarios anticipating a budget cut of 10 percent, and a budget advisory committee reviewed all the scenarios.  Overall, I think that approach yielded budget-cut targets based on good reasoning, even though no one was happy with any of the cuts we had to impose.</p><p>For administrative support units, we tried to be sensitive to the ability of the units to absorb additional cuts.  For academic divisions, we looked at the level of cuts we thought they could absorb both from the point of view of growth they had achieved over the previous decade and the roles that they have in the current climate.  In addition, we considered short-term consequences of divisional roles, as well as long-term campus consequences.  Thus, we looked at the need for the campus to provide instruction for students and the need for the campus to generate new sources of revenues to offset the decreased state investment in higher education.  </p><p>We accordingly assigned slightly smaller percentage cuts (a differential cut of about one percent) to some divisions.  Considerations when allotting these differential cuts included historical student-interest patterns, the ability of particular disciplines to more effectively compete for grant funds from federal programs or private sources, and allocation of FTEs in each division relative to the FTE targets articulated in the academic plan.  </p><p><h4>Strategic planning going forward</h4></p><p>To move forward from here, we are trying to assess the magnitude of the cuts we might have to endure in the coming year (a lot of educated guesswork at this point in time) and discussing how we can improve on last year's process with regard to consultation and transparency.  This involves figuring out how to ask better questions at the beginning of the process, developing a process that allows for earlier consultation with the Academic Senate, staff, and students, assessing campus-level impacts that might not be clear from just gathering information from individual campus units, and a strategy for more effective campus communication as we go through the process.</p><p>With the huge cuts the campus has endured over the last two years, there are no easy cuts to be made.  Any new cuts will cause inconveniences, weakening of programs, and pain at many levels.  I hope we can approach this task with the understanding that we must make decisions that support the primary research and teaching missions of the campus, realizing that this is a complex organization and how these missions are best supported is not always obvious.  In particular, we should be prepared to acknowledge that in some cases the best way to support our core academic mission is to provide funding for critical support functions in administrative units.   We may also have to face the uncomfortable fact that the best path to sustaining quality in instruction and research may be to reorganize academic and administrative units to better support academic programs, faculty, and students.  </p><p>I appreciate that the prospect of further funding reductions is dispiriting. I hope, however, that as we carry out our work, we can focus on how we can continue doing this work to the best of our ability with the resources we have and not only focus on resources we may lose.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915f381b8072704601a012ff562f0262"><name>3502</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>2010-2012 Staff Advisor to The Regents</title><start-date>1264057200000</start-date><display-name>2010-2012 Staff Advisor to...</display-name><path>/2010/01/3502</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/01/3502</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339190755</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339190755</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University is pleased to announce the application period for selection of the 2010-2012 Staff Advisor to the UC Board of Regents.

Images by Hongqing Du.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Research on the genetic defect that causes myotonic muscular dystrophy has revealed that the mutation disrupts an array of metabolic pathways in muscle cells through its effects on two key proteins. A study published in <em>Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology</em> shows that the loss of a single protein accounts for most of the molecular abnormalities associated with the disease, while loss of a second protein also seems to play an important role.</p>
<p>Each of the affected proteins interacts with an array of genes that are active in muscle cells and other tissues, said coauthor Manuel Ares, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The study reveals a cascading sequence of molecular events in which a mutation in one gene ends up affecting hundreds of other genes and the physiological processes that depend on them.</p>
<p>"This is a genetic disease in which there isn't just one gene that is affected," Ares said. "Our hope is that by chasing down more of the affected genes we might be able to figure out how to address more of the symptoms."</p>
<p>Myotonic dystrophy involves difficulty relaxing muscles (myotonia) and, as in other muscular dystrophies, progressive muscle weakness and wasting. The most common type of myotonic dystrophy (type 1) is caused by changes in a gene that has a repeating sequence of three DNA building blocks. This sequence is repeated five to 35 times in the normal gene, but an excessive number of repeats (50 to 5,000) leads to disease. When the defective gene is transcribed into a messenger RNA molecule, the expanded repeat section causes the RNA to bind tightly to certain proteins, forming clumps within the muscle cells.</p>
<p>"Previous studies have shown that two proteins called Mbnl1 and Mbnl2 are bound up by the repeat RNA and create an aggregate inside the nucleus of the muscle cell," Ares said.</p>
<p>By binding these proteins in clumps, the abnormal RNA prevents them from carrying out their normal functions in the cell. Mbnl1 is involved in a process called RNA splicing, in which the messenger RNA copied from a gene gets "edited" before it can direct the synthesis of proteins.</p>
<p>"When a gene is turned on, its DNA sequence gets copied into a messenger RNA molecule. But that direct copy needs to be processed to make a functional message that can be translated into a protein," Ares said. "Splicing factors like Mbnl1 tell the splicing machinery where to do the cutting and pasting. Without Mbnl1, incorrect splicing can affect lots of different genes."</p>
<p>Ares has pioneered the use of microarray technology to detect changes in RNA splicing caused by genetic mutations and other perturbations. UCSC graduate student Hongqing Du, the first author of the paper, earned her M.D. from Harbin Medical University in China and was eager to apply this technology to a human disease. So Ares and Du teamed up with leading investigators of mytonic dystrophy who had developed animal models of the disease.</p>
<p>Charles Thornton's lab at the University of Rochester School of Medicine developed a mouse strain that expresses large amounts of the abnormal repeat RNA in muscle cells. Maurice Swanson's lab at the University of Florida College of Medicine developed a mouse strain that is unable to make the Mbnl1 protein. Both strains of mice show symptoms similar to myotonic dystrophy.</p>
<p>Ares's lab used splicing-sensitive microarrays developed in collaboration with Affymetrix to show that the RNA splicing defects in muscle cells from these two mouse strains are nearly the same. This indicates that the vast majority of the splicing problems are due to the loss of the Mbnl1 protein as a result of binding to the abnormal repeat RNA. Earlier studies had associated several splicing defects with the disease, but the microarrays revealed effects on a much larger number of genes.</p>
<p>"Our microarray methods detected hundreds of splicing events that were being affected, giving us a broader picture of what's going on in cells as the disease is taking hold," Ares said.</p>
<p>Tests for some of the newly identified splicing defects in human patients with myotonic dystrophy confirmed that the same changes occur in both mouse and human cells. More extensive testing in humans will enable the researchers to identify which RNA splicing changes might be clinically useful for diagnosing or monitoring the disease, Ares said.</p>
<p>The researchers also found another set of changes that were seen only in the mouse strain that makes the abnormal repeat RNA and not in the mice lacking Mbnl1. These effects were not splicing errors, but changes in gene expression detected by microarrays that measured the amounts of messenger RNA being transcribed from different genes.</p>
<p>"We suspect that the loss of Mbnl2 is responsible for those gene expression defects," Ares said.</p>
<p>Many of the genes with altered expression levels are involved in making the extracellular matrix, a protein coat that binds muscle cells together and enables muscle tissue to generate a coherent force when it contracts.</p>
<p>"We're excited by this finding because the group of genes affected is rich in these structural components operating outside the cell to hold the tissue together, and that might explain some aspects of the disease," Ares said. "Some of the genes in this class have been implicated in other kinds of genetically inherited muscular dystrophy and connective tissue diseases, revealing unanticipated links with the myotonic form of muscular dystrophy."</p>
<p>A recent grant from the Muscular Dystrophy Association will enable Ares and his collaborators to investigate how these findings might be used to help patients with myotonic dystrophy. The researchers may be able to develop methods for early detection of the disease or for predicting how the disease will progress in individual patients. Further research could also yield molecular markers of the disease for use in developing and evaluating new treatments.</p>
<p>"Right now we have a bewildering list of splicing events that are going wrong, as well as gene expression defects, and we have a lot of work to do to figure out which are the key events that might be used as reliable markers of the disease," Ares said.</p>
<p>In addition to Ares, Du, Swanson, and Thornton, the coauthors of the paper include Melissa Cline, John Paul Donohue, Megan Hall, and Lily Shiue of UC Santa Cruz; Robert Osborne of the University of Rochester School of Medicine; Daniel Tuttle of the University of Florida College of Medicine; and Tyson Clark of Affymetrix. This research was supported by grants from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915f3fe18072704601a012ff30f7d75f"><name>3507</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Robert Irion, director of Science Communication Program, wins journalism award</title><summary>Robert Irion has been awarded the 2010 David N.

Schramm award from the High Energy Astrophysics Division of the American Astronomical Society. His winning article, entitled "Homing in on Black Holes," appeared as the cover story in the April 2008 issue of <i>Smithsonian</i> magazine.</p><p>The purpose of the <a href="http://www.aas.org/head/schramm/schramm.prize.html">Schramm Award</a> is to recognize and stimulate distinguished writing on high-energy astrophysics in order to improve the general public's understanding and appreciation of this exciting field of research. This is the second time Irion has won the Schramm Award, having shared it with <i>Science News</i> reporter Ron Cowen in 2003.</p><p>In the <i>Smithsonian</i> <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/black-holes.html">story</a>, Irion described efforts to study the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy with adaptive optics at the W. M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The project, led by astronomer Andrea Ghez of UCLA, uses a laser guide star to clarify views of young stars trapped in tight, fast orbits around the black hole, which may contain 4 million times the mass of our Sun.</p><p>The award consists of a prize of $1,500 and a plaque containing a citation. The publisher of the winning work will receive a certificate honoring the publication in which the work appeared. The award is sponsored by HEAD/AAS, which pays the winning author's personal travel expenses so that the award can be received in person at the next <a href="http://www.confcon.com/head2010/">HEAD meeting</a>, which will be held March 1 to 4, 2010, on the Big Island of Hawaii.</p><p>"I'm grateful to Andrea and her team for the nights they spent with me at Keck," Irion said. "Watching the laser system in action was a privilege, and it will be an honor to return to Hawaii to accept the award. I'm also indebted to my editor at <i>Smithsonian</i>, Laura Helmuth, for her guidance."</p><p>Helmuth and Irion are both graduates of the UCSC Science Communication Program.</p><p>David Schramm was a distinguished scientist who is widely regarded as the founder of the field of particle astrophysics, a discipline where cosmology and particle physics meet. High-energy astrophysics incorporates experimental and theoretical studies of high-energy photons and particles from the cosmos, including the disciplines of x-ray, gamma-ray and cosmic-ray astronomy.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915f41758072704601a012ff16c6bedb"><name>3508</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Humanities professor wins 2009 prize for scholarly outreach</title><summary>Professor of classics and comparative literature Mary-Kay Gamel has been awarded the 2009 Prize for Scholarly Outreach from the American Philological Association (APA)--the national classics association</summary><author>Scott Rappaport (831) 459-2496;

Joe Simitian, D-Palo Alto, and Assemblymembers Bill Monning, D-Monterey, and Ira Ruskin, D-Mountain View - all UC Berkeley grads, they noted - acknowledged the prospect of another $20 billion deficit facing California and the difficulty in getting any budget with new taxes passed with the requisite two-thirds majority.</p><p>But all agreed with moderator John Laird, a UC Santa Cruz grad, current lecturer and former chair of the Assembly Budget Committee that the legislature and governor must make higher education a priority for funding. "It's a matter of utmost importance," Laird said. </p><p>Also attending the forum sponsored by UC Santa Cruz, the Santa Cruz Area Chamber of Commerce, and Santa Cruz Next were Brian King, president of Cabrillo College, Kathy Cruz-Uribe, provost of California State University, Monterey Bay, local business leaders, the five UCSC deans, and several academic department chairs. </p><p>Referring to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's recent pronouncements that higher education deserves a greater proportion of state revenue than prisons, Blumenthal said he was "heartened that the conversation is shifting from despair to hope and aspiration."</p><p>The forum "demonstrated how we can all work together toward the dream of quality and accessible higher education for all Californians," he said.</p><p>Administrators, faculty, and students described the impacts on UC Santa Cruz of more than $50 million in budget cuts over a two-year period. Speaking for the faculty, History Department chair Mark Traugott described how he  must manage a department with "the same number of students and fewer faculty." </p><p>History has lost four professors to retirement whom he cannot replace, Traugott said. The four happen to be in European history, cutting that specialty in half. </p><p>Several other senior faculty echoed Traugott's concerns about the prospect of losing faculty as pay and benefits further lag other universities. </p><p>Undergraduate Matthew Palm and graduate student Chelsey Juarez described the difficulty getting into classes and the effects of steep tuition increases.  Juarez said some graduate students were having to suspend their studies. "Graduate students are the people power we need to protect," she said.</p><p>The legislators didn't need much convincing. When it was their turn to talk, each described the transformative effects that a UC education had on them. It "gave me the opportunity to become a state senator and represent 950,000 Californians," said Simitian, whose district includes UCSC. </p><p>Ruskin, who co-chairs the Joint Committee on the Master Plan of Higher Education, said he was encouraged that a conversation is "taking place for the first time in a long time to explain the necessity of higher education for the prosperity of California."</p><p> </p><p>Monning said education at all levels is the third largest employer in his district that encompasses Santa Cruz and the Monterey Bay Area.

Last March, he received the prestigious 2009 Shelley Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America. </p><p>"Poets, like prophets, frequently find no honor in their own land, so it is especially gratifying to be recognized by the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County," said Young. </p><p>"Santa Cruz is blessed with an abundance of superlative artists and writers, and to represent our area's many exceptional poets is a great distinction, and a humbling one," he added. </p><p>Young graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 1973 and received his M.F.A. from UC Irvine in 1975. He currently teaches poetry as a lecturer in creative writing in the UC Santa Cruz Literature Department. </p><p>Young's books include <i>Pleasure, Hands, The Dream of A Moral Life</i> (winner of the James D. Phelan Award), <i>Days, Braver Deeds</i> (winner of the Peregrine Smith Poetry Prize), and <i>No Other Life</i> (winner of the Poetry Society of America's William Carlos Williams Award for best book of the year published by a university, literary, or independent press).</p><p>Since 1975, Young has also designed, illustrated, and printed limited-edition books and broadsides at his Greenhouse Review Press. His print work is represented in many collections, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Getty Center for the Arts.</p><p>"The creation of this new Poet Laureate position says more about the community's support of the arts than it does about my own personal accomplishments," Young observed. </p><p>"This is yet another example of the community's recognition that encouragement of the arts is a fundamental component of a fully functioning, exuberant culture."</p><p>Michelle Williams, executive director of the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz, said that "a great deal of passion and expertise went into creating this position," adding,"you will have many chances to hear Gary speak and read in the upcoming two years."  </p><p>Williams noted that the tradition of naming a poet laureate began in 17th Century England. The United States Library of Congress appointed an official Consultant in Poetry in 1937, and the name of that position was changed to Poet Laureate in 1985.  </p><p>California became the first state to name a poet laureate informally, and the position was established by the legislature in 2001. </p><p>The Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County runs programs and services to support the artistic health and vibrancy of the community, advancing the arts by providing funding, advocacy, and support to artists and arts organizations.  </p><p>As the state- and county-designated arts umbrella organization for Santa Cruz County, the Cultural Council's programs include the annual Open Studios Art Tour, the SPECTRA teaching artist program in local schools, support grants for artists and arts organizations, and Fast Track matching grants to schools for arts education.  </p><p>						</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915f4e5b8072704601a012ff56f51fdc"><name>3515</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>23rd Annual Women at Work 2010 Retreat Postponed</title><start-date>1264662000000</start-date><display-name>23rd Annual Women at...</display-name><path>/2010/01/3515</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/01/3515</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339196424</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339196424</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>After careful consideration and consultation with our sponsors, Staff Human Resources and Chancellor's office; it is with deep regret we must postpone this year's retreat until next year 2011.

For exclusively-represented employees, please refer to applicable provisions in collective bargaining agreements.</p><p>With regard to the Haiti disaster, appropriate circumstances for administrative leave with pay include the following:</p><p>. Employees with special skills, such as medical personnel, scientific and technical personnel, and environmental health and safety personnel who are members of University-sponsored response teams that are organized on a university-wide or local basis and are being sent to assist with relief efforts;</p><p>. Employees who are involved with official relief efforts sponsored by FEMA, the Red Cross, and other sanctioned organizations, whose assistance has been requested by the agency; and</p><p>. Employees who were traveling in the area at the time of the disaster and became stranded.</p><p>As relief efforts will be ongoing for an extensive period of time, the period of paid leave that is granted is wholly dependent upon the particular circumstances of each employee, taking into account the type of relief work being performed and operational considerations.</p><p>Further, UCOP Risk Services has arranged to extend important travel and security services to UC students and employees who travel to Haiti on behalf of official humanitarian relief and support organizations, such as the Red Cross, various food banks and medical aid organizations. Any University of California Student or Employee who travels to Haiti on behalf of any legitimate relief or aid organization should register their travel through Risk Services' online travel insurance system at <a href="https://www.uctrips-insurance.org/">https://www.uctrips-insurance.org/</a>.

Supplemental guidelines for staff employees may be accessed through the Announcements section of the SHR website: <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/haiti/relief.htm">http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/haiti/relief.htm</a>.</p><p>. Supplemental guidelines for academic employees may be accessed through the What's New section of the APO website: <a href="http://apo.ucsc.edu/">http://apo.ucsc.edu/</a>.</p><p>These guidelines also provide information about other types of leave for circumstances that are not covered by PPSM 46.E and APM 758 (e.g., employees who, on their own initiative, wish to volunteer to aid with relief efforts or who need to assist or care for family and friends directly affected by the disaster). In instances of employee-initiated relief efforts, employees should be aware of their potential liability when they are on leave.</p><p>Questions involving staff employees should be directed to: Cathy Schoenfeld, ext. 92014 or <a href="mailto:pafc@ucsc.edu">pafc@ucsc.edu</a>.</p><p>Questions involving academic employees should be directed to the appropriate divisional academic personnel coordinator. </p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Staff and Faculty</audience><admin>Pamela Peterson, Assistant Vice Chancellor, Academic Personnel; Charlotte Moreno, Assistant Vice Chancellor, Staff Human Resources </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9161edc78072704601a012ff2c88180e"><name>3941</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Update on Budget Planning</title><start-date>1264057200000</start-date><display-name>Update on Budget Planning...</display-name><path>/2010/01/3941</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/01/3941</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339368339</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282339368339</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Executive Vice Chancellor/Provost Dave Kliger announced in early January that he intends to leave his administrative post on June 30.
