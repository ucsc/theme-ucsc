<p>The paper, "Steelhead life history on California's Central Coast: Insights from a state-dependent model," presents a mathematical model for the life histories of steelhead in small coastal streams. Steelhead are rainbow trout that migrate to the sea and return to their home streams to spawn. Unlike salmon, they can spawn repeatedly, and there is great variability in the age at which they leave freshwater and when they return to spawn.</p>
<p>Satterthwaite, currently an assistant researcher in applied math and statistics, worked on the study as a postdoctoral researcher in the Center for Stock Assessment Research (CSTAR) at UCSC. The coauthors of the paper include Marc Mangel, professor of applied math and statistics in the Baskin School of Engineering and director of CSTAR; UCSC graduate student Michael Beakes; Erin Collins and Robert Titus of the California Department of Fish and Game; CSTAR postdoctoral researcher David Swank; Joseph Merz of Cramer Fish Sciences and the UCSC Institute of Marine Sciences; and Susan Sogard of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Santa Cruz Laboratory.</p>
<p>The researchers investigated the factors that influence the life history trajectories of steelhead in Central Coast streams. Their mathematical model combined physiological and evolutionary approaches using a method (called state-dependent life history theory) developed and popularized by Mangel.</p>
<p>The model involves strategies that depend on age, size or condition, and recent rates of change in size or condition during specific periods in advance of the actual smolting or spawning event. By comparing the predictions of the model with empirical results from Central Coast streams, the researchers showed that the theory can explain the observed patterns and variation in the life histories and the distribution of sizes and ages at ocean migration for steelhead rearing in the upstream habitats of these streams.</p>
<p>"This is the first study in which such a model is fully parameterized based on data collected entirely from California steelhead populations," Mangel said.</p>
<p>CSTAR is a collaboration between the NMFS Santa Cruz Laboratory and UC Santa Cruz to train students and post-graduate researchers in the quantitative tools and basic science needed in fisheries management. Mangel said the recognition of Satterthwaite's work is an indication of the quality of the research being done at the center. He noted that two current graduate students affiliated with CSTAR were awarded fellowships in population dynamics this year from the highly competitive NOAA Fisheries/Sea Grant Fellowship Program.</p>
<p>Six of these fellowships, each of which provides $38,500 per year in research funding, were awarded nationally. Valerie Brown, a graduate student in applied mathematics and statistics, will investigate the robustness of the stock assessment process for salmon fisheries. Kate Richerson, a graduate student in ecology and evolutionary biology, had to turn down the NOAA/Sea Grant fellowship because she had already accepted a National Science Foundation graduate research fellowship. She will be studying the impact of the krill fishery in the Southern Ocean on populations of seabirds that feed on krill.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91620a8e8072704601a012ff8377ec1d"><name>3957</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Bats facing regional extinction in the northeast from rapidly spreading disease, UCSC researcher finds</title><summary>A new infectious disease spreading rapidly across the northeastern United States has killed millions of bats and is predicted to cause regional extinction of a once-common bat species, according to the findings of a University of California, Santa Cruz re</summary><author>Guy Lasnier, (831) 459-2955; lasnier@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>bat, bats, frick, winifred frick, fred frick, science, ucsc, uc santa cruz, environmental studies, white-nose syndrome</keywords><description>A new infectious disease spreading rapidly across the northeastern United States has killed millions of bats and is predicted to cause regional extinction of a once-common bat species, according to the findings of a University of California, Santa Cruz re</description><start-date>1280991600000</start-date><display-name>Bats facing regional extinction...</display-name><path>/2010/08/3957</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/08/3957</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339375638</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282946252551</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2955</phone><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/08/images/frick.winifred.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/08/images/frick.winifred.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>frick.winifred.300.jpg</name><file-size>122079</file-size><width>300</width><height>379</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>A study by UCSC environmental studies researcher Winifred F.

<h4>Winifred Frick on 'Science Friday'</h4>
Winifred Frick is scheduled to be interviewed on National Public Radio's "<a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com">Science Friday</a>" on Friday, August 6. The program is broadcast locally at noon on <a href="http://www.kazu.org">KAZU 90.3 FM</a> Watch <a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/program/archives/201008061">video</a> courtesy of Science Friday and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBXqj8SViKc">another</a> courtesy of Boston University.</div>
<p>A new infectious disease spreading rapidly across the northeastern United States has killed millions of bats and is predicted to cause regional extinction of a once-common bat species, according to the findings of a University of California, Santa Cruz, researcher.</p>
<p>The disease, white-nose syndrome, first discovered near Albany, N.Y., in 2006, affects hibernating bats and has caused millions to perish, writes lead author Winifred F. Frick, in a study published in the August 6 issue of <em>Science</em>.</p>
<p>Frick, a UC Santa Cruz graduate who is now a post-doctoral researcher in UCSC's Environmental Studies department, said the disease is spreading quickly across the northeastern U.S. and Canada and now affects seven bat species. If death rates and spread continue as they have over the past four years, this disease will likely lead to the regional extinction of the little brown myotis, previously one of the most common species in North America, she said.</p>
<p><strong>Wildlife crisis</strong></p>
<p>"This is one of the worst wildlife crises we've faced," Frick said. "The bat research and conservation communities are trying as hard as possible to find a solution to this devastating problem."</p>
<p>Frick notes that "bats perform valuable ecosystem services that matter for both the environments they live in and have tangible benefits to humans as well. Bats affected by this disease are all insect-eating species, and an individual bat can consume its body weight in insects every night, including some consumption of pest insects," Frick said.</p>
<p>"The loss of so many bats is basically a terrible experiment in how much these animals matter for insect control," she said.</p>
<p>Frick received her B.A. in environmental studies at UCSC (Porter '98). She completed her Ph.D. at Oregon State University in 2007 and is currently a National Science Foundation Bioinformatics Postdoctoral Fellow with a joint appointment at UCSC and Boston University. She is also the research director of the <a href="http://www.batresearch.org">Central Coast Bat Research Group</a> in Aptos.</p>
<p><strong>Newly discovered fungus</strong></p>
<p>White-nose syndrome is associated with a newly discovered fungus that grows on the exposed tissues of hibernating bats.</p>
<p>Frick and the study's co-authors, including Jacob F. Pollock, in the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, and noted bat experts Thomas H. Kunz and D. Scott Reynolds at Boston University, analyzed bat population data collected over the last 30 years, from 22 caves and other hibernating sites, in five states throughout the northeastern U.S.</p>
<p>The serious population declines of the little brown myotis were recognized based on surveys made by officials from state departments of natural resources going back to 1979. Surveys in the winter of 2006-2007 revealed evidence of white fungal growth on bats' noses, ears, and forearms, aberrant behavior, and an unusually high number of dead bats. As many as 500,000 bats may occupy a single cave.</p>
<p>Decreases in the number of bats counted range from 30 percent to 99 percent compared with earlier counts before the disease struck. Since its discovery four years ago, white-nose syndrome has now been confirmed in at least 115 bat hibernating locations in the U.S. and Canada, and as far west as Oklahoma.</p>
<p><strong>Hibernation disrupted</strong></p>
<p>Current research suggests that the fungus disrupts the bats' hibernation, causing them to awake early, behave oddly, and lose critical fat reserves, resulting in death. The researchers predict a "99 percent chance of regional extinction of little brown myotis within the next 16 years" if mortality and spread continue unabated.</p>
<p>"Our results paint a grim picture of a once-healthy population of an abundant and widely distributed species now experiencing unprecedented losses," the authors write.</p>
<p>"The rapid decline of a common bat species from white-nose syndrome draws attention to the need for increased research, monitoring, and management to better understand and combat this invasive wildlife disease," the authors conclude.</p>
<p>The researchers said it is possible the deadly fungus came from Europe from human trade or travel based on evidence that the same fungus has been observed on hibernating bat species in Europe.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91620d808072704601a012ff01ca0163"><name>3958</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>California sea otter numbers drop again</title><summary>After a decade of steady recovery, the southern sea otter is in decline for the second year in a row, according to the latest population survey by USGS and UCSC researchers.</summary><author>Ben Landis, USGS, (916) 616-9468, blandis@usgs.gov</author><keywords>Tim Tinker, southern sea otter, California sea otter, sea otters, USGS, sea otter census</keywords><description>After a decade of steady recovery, the southern sea otter is in decline for the second year in a row, according to the latest population survey by USGS and UCSC researchers.</description><start-date>1280818800000</start-date><display-name>California sea otter numbers...</display-name><path>/2010/08/3958</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/08/3958</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339376418</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1283537013720</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/08/images/otter_usgs_small.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/08/images/otter_usgs_small.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>otter_usgs_small.jpg</name><file-size>60084</file-size><width>275</width><height>224</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The southern sea otter (above) is a federally listed threatened species.

<p>"We have seen a decrease in sea otter numbers throughout most of their range, particularly in those areas where most of their reproduction occurs, while pup counts have dropped to 2003 levels," said Tim Tinker, lead scientist for the annual survey.</p>
<p>"A number of human and natural factors may be influencing this trend, and we are working to better understand what those are," said Tinker, an adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz and research scientist with the USGS Western Ecological Research Center.</p>
<p>Population estimates are calculated as three-year averages of annual survey results, which compensate for variability in observation conditions and give scientists a more reliable picture of abundance trends. This year's estimate--averaging counts from 2010, 2009, and 2008--is 2,711 otters. This represents a 3.6 percent drop for the overall population and an 11 percent drop in the number of otter pups compared to 2009 estimates.</p>
<p>For southern sea otters to be considered for removal from threatened species listing, the overall population estimate would have to exceed 3,090 for three consecutive years. This is the threshold established under the Southern Sea Otter Recovery Plan by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>
<p>Researchers also saw the sea otter's geographic distribution shrink this year, with fewer animals at the northern and southern ends of their range, which is now from Pigeon Point to Gaviota State Park in California.</p>
<p>"Movements and clumping of male otters away from the range edges may partially explain this change," said USGS biologist Brian Hatfield, who organizes the otter survey. "And the low pup count might be linked to heavy storms and reduced kelp cover this past winter, since we also saw a record number of pups and juveniles that got stranded ashore."</p>
<p>As for the overall population decline, all indications point to elevated mortality.</p>
<p>"Our data suggest that breeding-age females are dying in higher than usual numbers from multiple causes, including infectious disease, toxin exposure, heart failure, malnutrition, and shark attacks," Tinker said.</p>
<p>Sea otters are active predators that rely on near-shore coastal waters. As a result, they are constantly exposed to many stressors, such as chemicals and pathogens from coastal water pollution, ingestion of toxin-contaminated prey, and reduced food abundance. Chronic exposure to multiple stressors could make otters more susceptible to illness and injury and lead to a greater chance of death.</p>
<p>"Recovery will clearly depend on our understanding the factors contributing to slow population growth in recent years and the current downturn," said Lilian Carswell, Southern Sea Otter Recovery Coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "Research is fundamental to recovery efforts because we need to understand which stressors are most strongly affecting survival rates in order to develop targeted measures to address them."</p>
<p>To help untangle this complex puzzle of stressor effects and interactions, Tinker is leading a study to compare sea otter health between areas with different types and severity of stressors, to find out which area has healthier otters and why.</p>
<p>"Remember, sea otter health can tell us a lot about the health of the coastal waters that humans also enjoy, so we're eager to learn more," Tinker said.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted during the month of May from Point San Pedro in San Mateo County down to the Santa Barbara/Ventura County line. The survey has been conducted annually since 1985 and is a cooperative effort of the USGS Western Ecological Research Center; the California Department of Fish and Game's Marine Wildlife Veterinary Care and Research Center; Monterey Bay Aquarium; University of California, Santa Cruz; and many experienced and dedicated volunteers. Assistance also comes from staff of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91620fd68072704601a012ff459b649e"><name>3959</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Authors of new book about Grateful Dead's marketing approach to donate one fourth of advance and royalties to UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>Inspired by a thought-provoking feature article by Joshua Green in the March issue of &lt;i&gt;Atlantic&lt;/i&gt; magazine titled &lt;i&gt;Management Secrets of the Grateful Dead&lt;/i&gt;, Boston writers David Meerman Scott and Brian Halligan have just published a new book rele</summary><author>Scott Rappaport (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>grateful dead, Grateful Dead archive, UC Santa Cruz Grateful Dead Archive, UC Santa Cruz, UCSC, marketing, Atlantic magazine, philanthropy, visionaries, Nicholas Meriwether, Grateful dead archivist   </keywords><description>Inspired by a thought-provoking feature article by Joshua Green in the March issue of &lt;i&gt;Atlantic&lt;/i&gt; magazine titled &lt;i&gt;Management Secrets of the Grateful Dead&lt;/i&gt;, Boston writers David Meerman Scott and Brian Halligan have just published a new book rele</description><start-date>1280905200000</start-date><display-name>Authors of new book...</display-name><path>/2010/08/3959</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/08/3959</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339377025</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282946321274</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Library</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/08/images/dead_book_coverfinal_300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/08/images/dead_book_coverfinal_300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dead_book_coverfinal_300.jpg</name><file-size>101061</file-size><width>300</width><height>427</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Inspired by a thought-provoking feature article by Joshua Green in the March issue of <em>Atlantic</em> magazine titled <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/03/management-secrets-of-the-grateful-dead/7918/">Management Secrets of the Grateful Dead</a>, Boston writers David Meerman Scott and Brian Halligan have just published a new book released Monday called <em>Marketing Lessons from the Grateful Dead</em>.</p>
<p>Including a foreword by basketball legend Bill Walton, plus photos by longtime Dead photographer Jay Blakesberg, the book describes how the band's marketing strategy has become the quintessential model for the Internet age.</p>
<p>But here's the best part:</p>
<p>25 percent of the royalties will be donated directly to the Grateful Dead Archive at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>And that of course is the whole point.</p>
<p>"The Grateful Dead were famous for their devotion to charitable causes," explained Nicholas Meriwether, UCSC's Grateful Dead archivist, "and that is another lesson from the band that David and Brian took to heart."</p>
<p>"Just as their book demonstrates the band's model of excellence and creativity, David and Brian's gift is a remarkable expression of the band's belief in philanthropy."</p>
<p>The book's authors note that the Grateful Dead's early emphasis on content and social networking-using free giveaways, an open network of grassroots advertising, and special access (coined by modern marketers as the "freemium" model)-paid off big time as a long-term investment, earning the band unprecedented loyalty and a huge fan base.</p>
<p>"It's kind of like compounding interest inside your 401(k) account," Halligan recently told an audience at an East Coast book signing event.</p>
<p>However, the band's focus was not to make money, but rather to energize the crowd and spread the music-turning the Grateful Dead into what the authors describe as the "ultimate contrarian marketers.''</p>
<p>"The core values of the Grateful Dead have enabled them to develop one of the strongest brands in history, and some of the most loyal, longstanding, fervent fans -their customer base,'' says Walton.</p>
<p>As he notes in the book's foreword:</p>
<p>"Like other daring visionaries The Grateful Dead rejected conventional wisdom. We're seeing a tide change in traditional marketing no longer working or even being a player in the online space. It's only the visionaries who will win out and those visionaries know it's only when you tune into the fans that your product or service is going to succeed."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="916211648072704601a012ffbb1d104e"><name>3960</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Politics professor named campus director of UC Washington D.C. program</title><summary>Eva Bertram, associate professor of politics, will become the new UC Santa Cruz campus director for the UC Washington Program (UCDC).</summary><author>Guy Lasnier, (831) 459-2955; lasnier@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>eva bertram, ucsc, uc santa cruz, washington, D.C., UCDC, politics, internship</keywords><description>Eva Bertram, associate professor of politics, will become the new UC Santa Cruz campus director for the UC Washington Program (UCDC).</description><start-date>1280818800000</start-date><display-name>Politics professor named campus...</display-name><path>/2010/08/3960</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/08/3960</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282339377439</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282946353204</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Politics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2955</phone><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/08/images/bertram.eva.150.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/08/images/bertram.eva.150.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bertram.eva.150.jpg</name><file-size>35717</file-size><width>150</width><height>189</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Eva Bertram, associate professor of politics</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Eva Bertram, associate professor of politics, will become the new UC Santa Cruz campus director for the UC Washington Program (UCDC).</p>
<p>Before joining the politics department in 2003, Bertram worked in Washington D.C., for 10 years, primarily in the non-profit sector with several research, public policy, and public interest organizations, as well as for a congressional committee.</p>
<p>Since 2005, Bertram has served on the UCDC Advisory Board, has participated in the selection of UCDC faculty, teaching assistants, and students, and has worked closely with outgoing campus director Mark Cioc, professor of history, on issues related to the ongoing centralization of UCDC.</p>
<p>Approximately 65 UC Santa Cruz students participate in the UCDC program each year, spending one quarter in Washington, D.C., during which they complete an internship, a related research seminar, and (optionally) an elective course.</p>
<p>The UCDC campus director is responsible for overseeing promotion of the program, recruitment of students, review of applicants, and selection of participants. The director is also responsible for working with the Social Sciences Division and others at UCSC on curricular and administrative questions related to UCDC. The position is based at UCSC.</p>
<p>Bertram, a winner of the Social Sciences Distinguished Teaching Award, is author of a new book, <em>Building the Modern Workfare State: The New Politics of Public Assistance</em> (University of Pennsylvania Press).</p>
<p>She said working with UCDC aligns with many of her academic and intellectual interests. "Much of my research, writing and teaching in the politics department addresses questions of American public policy and political development, with a focus on federal social policy and labor market policy," she said.</p>
<p>"UCDC is a remarkable program," Bertram said. "Returning UCDC students are consistently positive about the program, and many describe it as entirely outside of their prior experience: many have never been outside of California, or seen government and policy making in action at any level. For these students in particular, this is an extraordinary opportunity offered by UCSC, all the more valuable at a time of budget and programmatic cutbacks in many areas."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

of all shapes and sizes fascinate Bachar, who drew this painting as an example for his class.(photo by Dan White.)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Students squinted and leaned close to their ocean artifacts: seal femurs and sand dollars, seaweed twists and dried-out sea stars.</p>
<p>Using graphite pencils and pieces of paper, they tried to make these relics look as realistic as possible, capturing textures, shapes and shadows.</p>
<p>"Typically, people would see this and wouldn't give it a second thought," said UCSC history major Rebecca "Roxy'' Maas, 21, referring to the seaweed loop she was drawing. "They would step right over it.''</p>
<p>But the UCSC Summer Session marine illustration course, taught by professional artist and UCSC graduate Amadeo Bachar, encourages students to notice what they overlooked before.</p>
<p>Starting with bones and shells in pencil, and working their way up to mammals, birds and plants in watercolor, the students will make the Monterey Bay come to life on paper. By the time the class is over, tuna, sea lions and sharks will swim across pieces of paper.</p>
<p>The end result is more than just a pretty picture. Bachar, 35, wants to change the way the class views the world.</p>
<p>"In this class, you learn about diversity,'' said Bachar, a science illustrator whose clients include National Geographic and Scientific American." You learn to connect the pieces of the puzzle.''</p>
<p>When Bachar encourages students to go out into the field with their paints and pencils, he's drawing from a deep pool of knowledge. For one thing, he's a recreational fisherman with an in-depth science background. On top of this, he grew up in Santa Cruz County and knows its seashores well.</p>
<p>"I can point them to great mussel beds near Scott Creek,'' said Bachar, referring to a beach north of Davenport.</p>
<p>Many students, including one who is taking a seven-credit summer-session psychology course, see the class as an escape from stresses. But Bachar does not sugarcoat the fact that painting, and marine illustration in particular, is challenging work.</p>
<p>"The toughest thing is capturing the way light behaves in water,'' Bachar said. "Often, halibut live in brown turbid water where the light is diffuse. But if you're painting blue fin or albacore tuna, the light is completely different. They're out in the pelagic zone 30 to 40 miles from shore where you get clear-blue aquamarine water."</p>
<p>The students are as diverse as the sea life they are painting. Some are studio art and science majors. Others are retirees, and high school students whose parents drive them to class twice a week from as far away as Walnut Creek.</p>
<p>During a recent visit to Bachar's class, the room was quiet, except for the instructor's whispered advice to students, and the sounds of graphite scratching on paper.</p>
<p>Jackson Winn, 20, a UCSC environmental studies and biology major, leaned close to his desk and stared at an elephant seal's baculum, a bone that plays a decisive role in the creature's mating activities. Winn was trying hard to render this object in 3D, capturing its shading, grainy texture and slender profile.</p>
<p>"It's so odd,'' said Winn, an environmental studies major. He found this particular baculum on a scientific trip down to Big Sur. Other students found elephant seal baby skulls and rib bones. "But I am the only one to find a baculum.''</p>
<p>Learning to draw such shapes is a stepping-stone. Winn and others will quickly graduate towards drawing and painting fleshed-out, full-color critters. Then the students start building whole ecosystems on paper.</p>
<p>The end result is a class that will shape the way the students look at ocean life.</p>
<p>"I didn't think it would be that difficult,'' said Sangeeta Nair, 20, an incoming junior at UCSC. She stared hard at the shell she was drawing. "It's the shape,'' she said. "At first I thought it's a simple fan but it's not. There's a little bulge in there that you don't take into account unless you're really looking.''</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="91c53fac8072704601a012ff141023cb"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><path>/2010/08/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/08/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282345877363</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282610509196</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><system-page id="9bd0c1088072704601a012ff9866746e"><name>3965</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>Environmental Studies postdoctoral researcher Winifred Frick's paper in the journal Science that predicts a regional extinction within 20 years of the little brown bat generated widespread publicity across the country and internationally</summary><start-date>1281081600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News</display-name><path>/2010/08/3965</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/08/3965</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282514403528</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282946484033</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><table>

New findings by cancer researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, reveal the molecular mechanisms involved in opening and closing that gate.</p>
<p>"We really need to understand how these proteins work at a mechanistic level if we're ever going to successfully target them with drugs," said Seth Rubin, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz. "The easiest type of drug to make is one that knocks out a protein function, but in this case you want the protein to function--you want it to be a gate that opens and closes at the right times."</p>
<p>The retinoblastoma protein was already known to be regulated by the addition and removal of phosphate groups. An enzyme called cyclin-dependent kinase adds phosphates (a process called phosphorylation), while another enzyme called protein phosphatase 1 removes them. When the retinoblastoma protein is phosphorylated, the gate is open and the cell cycle proceeds to cell division; the gate closes when the phosphates are removed.</p>
<p>Rubin's team used x-ray crystallography to figure out the three-dimensional structure of the retinoblastoma protein with the phosphatase enzyme bound to it. To their surprise, they found that when the phosphatase attaches to the protein to close the gate, it binds to the same site known to be used by the kinase when it adds phosphates and opens the gate. So the two enzymes are competing for the same "docking site" needed to control the gate.</p>
<p>"It explains how the binding of the phosphatase not only acts to close the gate by removing phosphates, but then keeps the gate closed by blocking access to the docking site so that the kinase can't get on and open the gate," Rubin said.</p>
<p>The researchers reported their findings in the August 8 issue of <em>Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology.</em> Alexander Hirschi, a graduate student in molecular, cell, and developmental biology, is the lead author of the paper. Coauthors include Rachel Steinhardt, a graduate student in chemistry and biochemistry, and Matthew Cecchini and Frederick Dick of the London Regional Cancer Program of the Children's Health Research Institute in Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>Hirschi performed most of the crystallography work involved in determining the protein structure. The researchers then carried out biochemical experiments to show that the two enzymes actually do compete for the same binding site in order to carry out their respective functions. Finally, the UCSC group teamed up with Canadian cancer researchers Cecchini and Dick to perform experiments in living cells.</p>
<p>Laboratory studies in cultured cells confirmed that the regulation of cell growth and division involves competition between kinase and phosphatase for the binding site on the retinoblastoma protein. In one experiment, the researchers used a mutant version of phosphatase unable to perform its normal phosphate-removing function to show that simply by binding to the retinoblastoma protein it was able to block the action of the kinase.</p>
<p>Kinases are already key targets in drug discovery efforts. Understanding the competitive interplay between kinases and phosphatases may help guide those efforts, Rubin said. "This kind of research is necessary to develop a fundamental understanding of these key proteins and may lead to new ways of targeting them," he said.</p>
<p>This research was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. Rubin's lab also receives funding from the <a href="http://www.sccbg.org/">Santa Cruz Cancer Benefit Group</a>, a local charity supporting cancer research and patient care.</p>

<p>Two UC Santa Cruz education researchers will study successful school organizations and teaching approaches that engage urban low-income Latino high school students in academically challenging work thanks to a $580,000 grant from the W.T. Grant Foundation.</p>
<p>Beginning in September, the three-year grant will enable researcher Betty Achinstein and professor of education Rodney Ogawa to investigate what works effectively in classroom interactions between students and teachers, and school-wide interactions among administrators, teachers, and parents at three innovating California high schools. Latino students are the fastest growing student population in California, yet reports reveal how schools are not meeting student needs.</p>
<p>The goal is to improve academic outcomes for Latino students, Ogawa said. "There has been lots of study on what's not working," he said. "It's time we begin documenting successes."</p>
<p>The research project is called &#8220;Schools Organized for Latina/o Educational Success&#8221; (SOLES). Ogawa and Achinstein work under the auspices of the Center for Educational Research in the Interest of Underserved Students (CERIUS), a research center in the division of Social Sciences at UC Santa Cruz. They will study three urban high schools selected because they have shown successful academic outcomes for Latino students.</p>
<p>Achinstein explained: "We will immerse ourselves in the school culture in order to understand the organizational and instructional factors that make a difference in the lives of Latino youth." The researchers will investigate mathematics and English classes, which Achinstein calls &#8220;gatekeeper subjects for college entry.&#8221; They will also explore school social structures and resources that promote instruction that engages Latino students in academically challenging work.</p>
<p>Achinstein, previously a researcher for nine years with UCSC's New Teacher Center, is also involved in a related study on the development and retention of teachers of color in schools serving Latino youth. The study will investigate the cultural resources of teachers and the organizational structures that support the teachers. The topic is critical given the call to diversify the teaching workforce, Achinstein said.</p>
<p>In addition to publishing their findings, Achinstein and Ogawa plan to share their research with the subject schools and others. "The goal is to inform educators, researchers, and policy makers, as well as support the efforts of the participating schools and communities in order to address the democratic imperative of educating students equitably," Achinstein said.</p>
<p>Ogawa said he hopes the study will contribute to the redesign and reinvention of American public education. "It is a very different economy now and schools need to be organized differently," Ogawa said, with the objective of closing the achievement gap between underserved students and their peers. "To close that we need to come up with new ways to organize schools."</p>

Only the University of Chicago, MIT, UC Berkeley, and Harvard University and its Kennedy School of Government ranked higher. The International Monetary Fund was ranked third.</p>
<p><a>Among monetary economists, the UCSC Economics Department&#160;</a><a href="http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.mon.html">ranked 24th globally</a>&#160;&#8211; 10th among academic departments when central bank research departments were excluded.</p>
<p>The rankings, which are updated monthly, come from a Web site and group called&#160;<a href="http://repec.org/">Research Papers in Economics</a>&#160;(RePEc), a collaborative effort of hundreds of volunteers in 71 countries whose goal is to enhance the dissemination of research in economics. The heart of the project is a decentralized database of working papers, journal articles, and software components.</p>
<p>The criteria are complicated and rankings can change often, said Carl Walsh, distinguished professor of economics and department chair at UC Santa Cruz. But, he said, they show "that UCSC has firmly established itself as one of the global centers for research in the area of international finance.</p>
<p>He added that UCSC's "strength in monetary economics is one of the reasons we are increasingly becoming a place that international central banks send their young economists to be trained."</p>
<p>The Web site lists four UCSC economists -- professors Joshua Aizenman, Yin-Wong Cheung, Michael Dooley, and Michael Hutchison -- among the top 5 percent of the 1,260 economists in international finance who register with the site. Walsh was ranked 42nd in the world among the 1,800 registered monetary economists. (Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke was first.)</p>
<p>RePEc is coordinated by an associate professor of economics at the University of Connecticut. The group's volunteers use 31 ways of ranking authors including number of papers, citations, and impact factors, drawing from the comprehensive database including 360,000&#160;<a href="http://ideas.repec.org/i/p.html">working papers</a>&#160;and 560,000&#160;<a href="http://ideas.repec.org/i/a.html">journal articles</a>.</p>
<p>Almost 22,000 economists are registered with RePEc. The rankings are based in part on citations that are compiled automatically from all documents in the RePEc library.</p>
<p>Faculty research at UCSC focuses on global economics.&#160;<a href="http://sciie.ucsc.edu/">The Santa Cruz Institute for International Economics</a>&#160;(SCIIE) sponsors research, conferences, and scholarly exchanges.

<p>To young scholars who are accustomed to using recycling bins and chewing vegan taquitos, the greening of UC Santa Cruz is not exactly front-page news.</p>
<p>But the campus has been getting high-profile reassurance that its sustainability efforts are paying off. <em>Sierra</em> magazine, published by the Sierra Club, America's oldest, largest environmental organization, and the <em>Princeton Review,</em> an admissions consulting, standardized test preparation and college guidebook-producing company, have both recognized UCSC as a green leader this month.</p>
<p>The Sierra Club named UCSC its 11th ranked green school in a survey and article released this week in its fourth-annual "Coolest Schools" issue. Meanwhile the <em>Princeton Review</em> selected UCSC as part of its Green Honor Roll Colleges, which means UCSC received the review's highest green rating, a 99, in its <a href="http://www.princetonreview.com/green.aspx">most recent survey results</a>.</p>
<p>UCSC has every reason to be proud, said Avital Binshtock, <em>Sierra</em> magazine's lifestyle editor.</p>
<p>"UCSC did very well," she said. "They only missed the top 10 by four-tenths of a point."</p>
<p>Other UC schools appear on the Sierra Club roster and on the <em>Princeton Review</em> honor roll--but UCSC is the only campus in the system that got high honors on both lists this year. That's quite a feat considering the stiff competition. The Sierra Club sent out an 11-page questionnaire to 900 colleges and universities, with detailed questions regarding sustainability efforts. In response, the magazine received 163 filled-out surveys.</p>
<p>Aurora Winslade, UCSC's sustainability manager, was thrilled about the double-shot of recognition.</p>
<p>"This reflects the passion of people who are willing to put in the time to create a healthier campus," Winslade said. "The campus continues to be a leader in sustainable foods. We are increasing our recycling and composting efforts and energy efficiency."</p>
<p>The campus ranked seventh in the nation on <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=3149">last year's <em>Sierra</em> magazine green list</a>, though the magazine's editors attributed this slight drop to the magazine's revised ranking criteria.</p>
<p>The magazine made a special mention of UCSC's "impressive 73 percent waste-diversion rate and plan to reach 100 percent by 2020."</p>
<p>On the <em>Sierra</em> green list, UCSC tied with Middlebury, and beat out the University of Colorado, now ranked at 13. Overall, UCSC scored an 82 percent rating--impressive, considering the top-ranked school got 88.6 percent.</p>
<p>The campus scored especially high in the food-sourcing category, with 20 percent of cafeteria food grown within 100 miles of campus. A full 100 percent of coffee and tea served on campus is organic. A total of 15 percent of food served in UCSC cafeterias is USDA certified organic.</p>
<p><em>Sierra'</em>s Binshtock considered UCSC "green" even before guiding the ranking project at the magazine.</p>
<p>"That's what Santa Cruz is all about," she said. " I live in San Francisco, and I knew people who grew up there and went to UCSC. They all have the mindframe that nature is important and should be celebrated and loved."</p>

<p>The Ellison Medical Foundation has selected Amy Ralston, an assistant professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz, as a New Scholar in Aging, providing $400,000 over four years to support her research on the biology of stem cells.</p>
<p>The unique ability of stem cells to produce large numbers of many different cell types in the body makes them an extremely valuable tool in regenerative medicine. But cells accumulate genetic defects with age, so stem cells derived from older patients may have limitations. Ralston will use the funding from the Ellison Medical Foundation to investigate the effects of aging on the quality of stem cells.</p>
<p>A major breakthrough in stem cell research was made by Japanese researchers who developed a technique to convert mature cell types into cells with the properties of embryonic stem cells. Like embryonic stem cells, these reprogrammed cells are "pluripotent," capable of producing many different cell types. As a result, stem cells for therapeutic uses could be derived from a patient's own cells, providing a perfect genetic match and eliminating the need for immunosuppressant drugs that patients must take to prevent rejection of foreign cells by the body.</p>
<p>According to Ralston, however, researchers still need to determine whether the reprogrammed cells differ from true embryonic stem cells in important ways.</p>
<p>"If we want to use them for clinical therapies, we have to understand how aging affects the quality of the stem cell you can make," she said. "They may have properties in common with embryonic stem cells, but they might also have properties in common with an 80-year-old patient, like an increased susceptibility to cancer."</p>
<p>Ralston's research will uncover new information about the aging process and could lead to new techniques for erasing the signs of aging from stem cells. She will also investigate other potential sources of pluripotent stem cells for therapeutic uses. One idea has been to derive stem cells from placental tissue, which could be obtained at birth and stored in a tissue bank as a source of eternally youthful stem cells for therapies later in life. But again, research is needed to assess the quality of stem cells provided by this approach.</p>
<p>"It's just an idea, and we don't really know how it would work," Ralston said. "We need to do comparisons of the quality of stem cells from different sources."</p>

<p>Several UC Santa Cruz faculty members contributed to a new report from the National Research Council (NRC) that identifies the top priorities for astronomy and astrophysics research in the coming decade. The decadal survey--the NRC's sixth--prioritizes activities based on their ability to advance science in key areas.</p>
<p>The report is enormously important to astronomers and astrophysicists because of its influence on the funding decisions of agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), NASA, and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). At UCSC, dozens of scientists crowded into a conference room in the Interdisciplinary Sciences Building to watch a live webcast of the public briefing at which the report was presented on Friday, August 13.</p>
<p>Claire Max, professor of astronomy and astrophysics and director of the Center for Adaptive Optics, and Steven Ritz, professor of physics and director of the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics, both served on the committee that prepared the report. The committee's extensive review of the field included input from nine expert panels, six study groups, and a broad survey of the astronomy and astrophysics community. Stan Woosley and Puragra Guhathakurta, professors of astronomy and astrophysics, and Piero Madau, professor of physics, all served on expert panels.</p>
<p>"There was a huge amount of community participation in this process, so a very large number of people were involved in providing input to the committee," Ritz said. "Also, for the first time, we did independent assessments of the proposed projects in terms of technical readiness and schedule and cost risks, and we made our program recommendations fit within the budget guidelines from the funding agencies."</p>
<p>The survey committee chose three top science objectives: searching for the first stars, galaxies, and black holes; seeking nearby habitable planets; and advancing understanding of the fundamental physics of the universe. According to the report, "These three objectives represent unprecedented opportunities now becoming within our capability to explore. The discoveries made will surely lead to new and sometimes surprising insights that will ... bring us closer to understanding the cosmos and our place within it."</p>
<p>The committee's proposed research program includes a balance of small, medium, and large initiatives, both on the ground and in space. For large space-based activities (exceeding $1 billion), the top priority is a "Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope," which would help settle fundamental questions about the nature of dark energy, contribute to the search for other Earth-like planets, and survey our galaxy and others. For large-scale ground-based initiatives (exceeding $135 million), the first priority is the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), a wide-field optical survey telescope that would observe more than half the sky every four nights and address diverse areas of study, such as dark energy, supernovae, and time-variable phenomena. Terry Schalk, adjunct professor of physics, is currently working on the camera for the LSST.</p>
<p>Another priority for large ground-based projects is a "Giant Segmented Mirror Telescope," a large optical and near-infrared telescope that will "revolutionize astronomy," the report said. Three international projects are currently competing to build the first such telescope, two involving U.S. scientists--the Thirty-Meter Telescope (TMT) and the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT). Jerry Nelson, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, is project scientist for the TMT, which involves many astronomers at UCSC and UC Observatories.</p>
<p>The federal government will only be able to support one of those two projects, and the committee recommended that the NSF move quickly to choose which one it will invest in. "They've got to figure that out as soon as possible," Max said. "NSF has done reviews of both projects, so they're very capable of making that decision."</p>
<p>Other recommendations in the report include the formation of a "Midscale Innovations Program" within the NSF astronomical sciences division that would fill a funding gap for compelling research activities that cost between $4 million and $135 million.</p>
<p>"I'm particularly happy about the recommendation to keep mid-size projects alive," Max said. "In the past, when a big project has had a cost overrun, it has tended to eat up smaller projects, and the committee was emphatic that that must not happen."</p>
<p>Ritz said the committee worked hard to include a balance of projects, from large-scale initiatives to smaller, moderate-cost projects. "There were probably ten times more proposed projects than could fit in the budget, so not everything could be done. But I think we've shown that, even with budget scenarios that are not particularly rosy, we can still do some very exciting science," he said.</p>
<p>The report notes that astronomical research continues to offer significant benefits to the nation beyond astronomical discoveries by capturing the public's attention and promoting general science literacy and proficiency. In addition, the research serves as a gateway to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers, and a number of important and often unexpected technological breakthroughs. The report makes several recommendations to improve astronomy and astrophysics education and calls for more U.S. participation in international research projects.</p>
<p>The study was funded by NASA, NSF, DOE, and a contribution from the Vesto Slipher bequest to the Academies. The National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, Institute of Medicine, and National Research Council make up the National Academies. They are private, nonprofit institutions that provide science, technology, and health policy advice under a congressional charter. The NRC is the principal operating agency of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering.</p>

<p>Scientists studying the massive earthquake that struck the South Pacific on September 29, 2009, have found that it actually involved two great earthquakes: an initial one with magnitude 8.1, which then triggered another magnitude 8 earthquake seconds later on a different fault. The details of this rare event, called a "triggered doublet," are unlike anything seismologists have seen before.</p>
<p>"We know of no precedent for the Samoa triggered doublet," said Thorne Lay, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who led a seismological analysis of the event published in the August 19 issue of&#160;<em>Nature.</em></p>
<p>The earthquakes unleashed devastating tsunami waves that swept onto the islands of Samoa, American Samoa, and Tonga, killing 192 people. It took months, however, for seismologists to make sense of the confusing seismic data and figure out exactly what happened in the Earth's crust to cause this disaster.</p>
<p>Most great earthquakes (earthquakes of magnitude 8 or greater) occur in subduction zones, where one plate of the Earth's crust dives beneath another plate. The Tonga subduction zone in the South Pacific marks the boundary where the Pacific plate is sinking under the Australian plate.</p>
<p>In the sequence of events on September 29, the first earthquake actually occurred not at the subduction zone, but within the Pacific plate at a site 50 to 100 kilometers (30 to 60 miles) east of the plate boundary. The rupture occurred along an extensional or "pull-apart" fault in the middle of the plate. Such large extensional faulting near a subduction zone is rare, and this is the third largest such event recorded in the 110-year history of seismological monitoring.</p>
<p>According to Lay, these events seem to occur in areas where the plate boundary is relatively weak and one plate slides easily under the other. As the leading edge of the oceanic plate sinks into the mantle, it pulls on the rest of the plate, bending it downward and causing it to break along the extensional fault.</p>
<p>"We think the subducted slab is pulling on the Pacific plate, and that 'slab pull' is responsible for the bending and extension of the plate manifested in the Samoa earthquake," he said.</p>
<p>As seismologists in several programs, including Lay's team, began to study the event in more detail, they noticed some strange inconsistencies. Aftershocks were spread over a huge area, including the Tonga subduction zone, with relatively few along the fault in the Pacific plate that had ruptured. In addition, when researchers used different methods to calculate the fault geometry, they came up with inconsistent solutions, which is rare for large earthquakes. Finally, tsunami prediction models gave results that were not entirely consistent with observations from ocean buoys and on the islands.</p>
<p>At a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in December, Chen Ji of UC Santa Barbara, who was not a member of Lay's team, suggested that the event involved two earthquakes on different faults with different geometries. Lay said he immediately began exploring the idea proposed by Ji.</p>
<p>"The huge signals from the extensional faulting made it difficult to resolve the triggered event, but we were able to confirm that secondary faulting had occurred, that it involved thrust faulting in the Tonga subduction zone, and that it released energy from about 50 to 130 seconds after the onset of extensional faulting within the Pacific plate," Lay said.</p>
<p>The strong shaking from the initial fault rupture appears to have triggered the second event, which involved two major subevents of magnitude 7.8, with a total magnitude equal to 8.0. This second event was followed by many aftershocks in the subduction zone. It also produced a tsunami wave that interfered with and complicated the wave pattern generated by the initial event. And it made the seismic wave analysis very difficult.</p>
<p>"It's impressive that we could have a magnitude 8 earthquake and not recognize it, but this one occurred so quickly after the first that it was not observed by the normal procedures," Lay said.</p>
<p>According to Lay, there is one prior case, in the Kuril Islands, of a pair of great earthquakes that included a subduction zone rupture and extensional faulting in the oceanic plate. In that case, however, the initial event occurred on a thrust fault in the Kuril subduction zone on November 15, 2006 (magnitude 8.4). Two months later, on January 13, 2007, the Pacific plate ruptured in a magnitude 8.0 extensional event. In that case, the slippage on the thrust fault put added stress on the extensional fault, which eventually ruptured.</p>
<p>"That type of behavior has been observed many times, but usually the late extensional faulting is much smaller than the thrusting event," Lay said.</p>
<p>In the Samoa-Tonga event, the extensional faulting occurred first and triggered the thrust fault, with a delay of less than a minute. The location of the thrusting event was not right next to the extensional faulting, but farther south along the Tonga subduction zone.</p>
<p>"In order for slab-pull to have loaded the extensional stress within the Pacific plate, the region of the subduction zone right next to the first event had to have low friction," Lay said. "The sudden extensional motion then produced strong vibrations that shook the plate boundary to the south and caused the abrupt thrusting motion."</p>
<p>Without the transient high strains from the shaking of the first earthquake, that region might have slipped slowly rather than abruptly. According to Lay, there is no record of prior great thrusting earthquakes in this region. "This is a state called conditional stability; the region would normally have episodic slow sliding without earthquakes, but if accelerated it becomes a normal fast-sliding zone," he said.</p>
<p>Earthquake triggering greatly complicates earthquake forecasting and rapid-warning procedures, Lay said. "There may be far more interaction between earthquakes than we have understood," he said. "Studying these complexities is essential for improving our understanding of how earthquakes rupture, how they interact, and how we can mitigate their impact on humans."</p>
<p>In addition to Lay, the coauthors of the paper include Charles Ammon of Pennsylvania State University; Hiroo Kanamori of the California Institute of Technology; Luis Rivera of the University of Strasbourg, France; Keith Koper of St. Louis University; and Alexander Hutko of the U.S. Geological Survey. This research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Geological Survey.</p>

<p>Two UCSC politics majors want to understand the Arab-Israeli conflict, but they refuse to put their blind trust in TV, blogs, and newspaper coverage.</p>
<p>Instead, Sami Abdelhalim and Mary "Carrie" McKee want to fly more than 7,000 miles to the heart of the conflict and talk with the people of Israel and the West Bank.<br/>
Soon they will get their chance, thanks to the support of UCSC leaders, including Chancellor George Blumenthal. Abdelhalim, 19, a Palestinian-American, and McKee, 20, who calls herself "unaffiliated," received full funding for their fact-finding trip to Israel and the West Bank as part of a student-run peace dialogue group called the&#160;<a href="http://www.olivetreeinitiative.org/">Olive Tree Initiative</a>.</p>
<p>Abdelhalim and McKee will head to the Holy Land on September 1 and will be back in California on September 19.</p>
<p>"Many people learn about the situation second-hand or read biased sources," McKee said. "But nothing compares to seeing the conflict up close and talking to people who have lived through it."</p>
<p>Blumenthal, who used chancellor's discretionary funds to provide support for the trip, said that he was "very impressed by the students' serious commitment to peace work and their desire for a deeper understanding of the conflict." He also commented on their "ambitious and far-ranging" itinerary and added that he "looks forward to their sharing their experiences with students on campus after they return."</p>
<p>Dean of Students Alma Sifuentes and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Felicia McGinty have also agreed to provide support for the trip.</p>
<p>While traveling, Abdelhalim and McKee will visit a few great destinations, including Jerusalem's Old City. But they will mostly be there on business, participating in roundtable discussions, interviews, and informal meetings with dozens of luminaries in Israel and in the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p>"It seems so obvious to me," McKee said. "Why not bring people from both sides of the conflict together for dialogue? But it isn't done very often."</p>
<p>Some of the people who will cross their path include the mayor of Hebron, Israeli settlers, kibbutz residents, and a photojournalist and TV producer who worked for Al Jazeera and the BBC. They will speak with Ibrahim Sarsur, the most senior Arab politician in the Knesset, and meet with Mark Regev, a spokesperson for the Israeli prime minister.</p>
<p>The Olive Tree Initiative is a UC Irvine-based peace organization that promotes dialogue and discussion regarding the Israeli-Arab conflict. The Initiative, which also has a branch at UC Santa Barbara, is best known for its unique program that sends participants on all-expenses-paid trips to the Middle East.</p>
<p>Although they do not pay for airfare or lodging, participants would hardly call the trips free. "Nothing is free," said a student in a promotional video, who described the back-to-back meetings and dialogue sessions as grueling but rewarding.</p>
<p>Abdelhalim has a personal stake in the upcoming trip. He was born in San Francisco but his family moved back to the West Bank, settling in a village just outside Ramallah in 1992, when he was 18 months old. His father stayed behind, working in a family furniture business in the Virgin Islands and later returning to San Francisco to open a convenience store.</p>
<p>"My father really wanted us to grow up in our own culture, and we did that," Abdelhalim said. "But when the political situation became unstable during the Second Intifada, we went back to America. I had to leave Palestine because of political reasons. I was so upset about it that I wanted to do something to change it."</p>
<p>On campus he joined a student organization called Committee for Justice in Palestine. Because of his work on the committee, he was invited to a far-ranging discussion about the Middle East at UC Irvine, where he learned about the Olive Tree Initiative.</p>
<p>After returning to campus this fall, Abdelhalim and McKee will share their adventures during public presentations, with the goal of improving peace dialogue among students.</p>
<p>This trip will be something new for both of them. Abdelhalim has never explored Israel. McKee has never been to the Middle East. She hopes to encourage a spirit of cooperation and mutual learning among student groups at UCSC.</p>
<p>"People who have been living with this conflict for their entire lives know so much more than I do," McKee said. "This is a chance to learn it from both sides. A lot of people go through life learning only one side of the story."</p>

<p>August 29 marks the five-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina hitting the Crescent City.</p>
<p>As part of a celebration of New Orleans at the San Francisco Jazz Heritage Center, UCSC professors Lewis Watts (Art) and Eric Porter (American Studies) will reflect on the five years that have passed since Katrina, and discuss their in-progress book project,&#160;<em>New Orleans Suite</em>.</p>
<p>"<em>New Orleans Suite</em>&#160;is not merely a book about Katrina,&#8221; says Porter, author of the award-winning 2002 book<em>What is This Thing Called Jazz?</em></p>
<p>&#8220;We consider how the storm was both a transformative force and a vehicle that enabled longstanding processes to come into view.&#8221;</p>
<p>Porter notes that the focus on celebrating the value of New Orleans&#8217; unique musical culture has sometimes drawn attention away from other pressing issues&#8212;such as the exploitation of musicians and other low-wage workers, or the conversion of public housing into mixed-use developments.</p>
<p>&#8220;We continue to see such contradictions as we contemplate the city's renewal five years after Katrina,&#8221; Porter observes.</p>
<p>&#8220;In many ways New Orleans is coming back. Young professionals are flocking to the city, which has seen something of a cultural renaissance over the past few years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet approximately 100,000 people who lived in New Orleans before the storm remain displaced,&#8221; adds Porter. "And many--especially in the city's lower income areas--have to deal with a high crime rate, public schools of poor quality, joblessness, and unreasonable rents, as much housing remains blighted or vacant.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UCSC professors&#8217; lecture/presentation will revolve around photographs that Watts has taken in Louisiana over the past two decades.</p>
<p>Watts has been working professionally as a photographer, archivist, and curator since 1974, focusing on communities in the neighborhoods of Oakland, Richmond and San Francisco.</p>
<p>He is co-author of the 2006 book,&#160;<em>Harlem of the West: The San Francisco Fillmore Jazz Era</em>, which features his restorations of salvaged photographs that portray musicians and patrons of the vibrant jazz scene in the Fillmore District during the 1940s and 50s.</p>
<p>Watts notes that he was supposed to do an artist-in-residency in New Orleans at the Ogden Museum of Southern Art in 2005, but Katrina derailed that plan.</p>
<p>However, he did manage to get there six weeks later.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first, the damage was overwhelming and more extensive than any of the photos I&#8217;d seen,&#8221; Watts says. &#8220;I began taking photographs, but after a while, I had to stop, because I realized the missing ingredient was people; everyone had left the city.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously Katrina is an important part of the story of New Orleans, but for me it is more of a frame of reference," adds Watts. "It&#8217;s really the people, the culture&#8212;both before and after Katrina&#8212;and the efforts at renewal, that draw me to photograph there.&#8220;</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>The lecture by UCSC professors Eric Porter and Lewis Watts will take place on Sunday, August 29, at 3 p.m. in the Media and Education Center of the Jazz Heritage Center in San Francisco (1320 Fillmore St. San Francisco) The event runs from 2 to 5 p.m., with music preceding the lecture, and a reception and music following. For more information, call (415) 255-7745.</em></p>

Stephens.</span></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dozens of students gained valuable experience in nanotechnology and energy research labs this summer through an internship program at the <a href="http://asl.ucsc.edu">Advanced Studies Laboratories</a> (ASL), a collaborative partnership led by UC Santa Cruz and NASA Ames Research Center. The student research projects, ranging from solar energy technology to thermoelectric devices, were on display in a poster session held last week in the ASL facility at NASA Ames, located at Moffett Field in Mountain View.</p>
<p>Much of the funding for the internship program is provided by the <a href="http://bin-rdi.soe.ucsc.edu">Bio-Info-Nano Research and Development Institute</a> (BIN-RDI), which is affiliated with ASL and was established through a NASA grant with support from Congressman Mike Honda (15th district). UCSC's Silicon Valley Initiatives also provided funding for summer interns.</p>
<p>"The internship program expanded by leaps and bounds this year," said BIN-RDI director Richard Hughey, a professor of computer engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UCSC. "We have about 15 students from UCSC and San Jose State University, there's another BIN-RDI program with a like number of students from Santa Clara University, and then there are various NASA programs that fund interns at ASL. It's a great opportunity for students to take part in nanotechnology research and training."</p>
<p>Salvador Vasquez, an undergraduate in electrical engineering at UCSC, said working in a research lab has been a great experience for him. "You learn how to work as part of a large research group, and you also get a sense of what graduate school is like," he said. "I'm thinking about going to graduate school, and I might not have considered that if I hadn't had this experience."</p>
<p>Vasquez has been working in the Thermal Characterization Laboratory led by Ali Shakouri, professor of electrical engineering at UCSC. His summer project involved using a technique called thermoreflectance imaging to look for defects in solar cells that can affect their efficiency and reliability.</p>
<p>In addition to Shakouri, other UCSC faculty with research labs at the ASL facility include Glenn Alers, adjunct professor of physics; Sue Carter, professor of physics; Bin Chen, adjunct professor of electrical engineering; Joel Kubby, associate professor of electrical engineering; and Nobuhiko Kobayashi, associate professor of electrical engineering and co-director of ASL. Several faculty from Santa Clara University, an ASL affiliate, also have labs at the facility.</p>
<p>Nathan Green, who graduated from UCSC in June with a B.S. in applied physics, studied solar concentrators in the Solar Energy and Renewable Fuels (SERF) lab led by Alers and Carter. Luminescent films can be used to concentrate sunlight onto solar cells and increase efficiency. But exposure to water and oxygen in the atmosphere can degrade the films, so Green studied the effectiveness of sealing luminescent films in an oxygen- and water-free environment to prevent degradation.</p>
<p>"With a solar concentrator, you don't need as many photovoltaic cells, so it can potentially reduce the cost of solar energy systems," he said.</p>
<p>Kobayashi had five students working in his Nanostructured Energy Conversion Technology &amp; Research (NECTAR) lab this summer. The NECTAR lab investigates nanoscale materials and technologies for the development of efficient, reliable, and cost-effective devices that convert light and heat energy sources into useful electrical power. Undergraduate Andy Liang worked with Kobayashi and graduate student Kaelan Yee on a project to measure the efficiency of thermoelectric devices, which convert heat into electricity.</p>
<p>"People don't expect to find materials science research at UCSC, but it is an important area of research for us now," Kobayashi said. "The internship program is a great opportunity for me to interact with students and get them involved in this research."</p>
<p>The eight-week internship program included seminars presented by ASL, NASA, and Santa Clara University researchers; a two-day workshop on Ethics in Science and another workshop on Technical Writing and Communications; a tour of the NASA Ames campus; and weekly seminars presented by the interns.</p>
<p>Santa Clara University chemistry professor and senior associate dean Amy Shachter worked with Hughey to design the SCU internship program at ASL. SCU undergraduate Sarah Ghanbari won an award for the project "of greatest benefit to society" for her poster describing a microfluidic system for rapidly detecting disease-causing organisms in water samples. Ghanbari worked with SCU bioengineer Unyoung (Ashley) Kim on the project, which aims to develop inexpensive, portable devices for use in the developing world.</p>
<p>Currently, a major focus of ASL and BIN-RDI is the establishment of a shared facility to provide state-of-the-art equipment for nanotechnology and materials science research. The Materials Analysis for Collaborative Science (MACS) facility recently acquired a new scanning electron microscope with x-ray analysis technology that enables rapid chemical analysis of samples. Other major instruments will be installed this fall, including a new transmission electron microscope and an x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) instrument.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b025c6db8072704601f19e50e2214c1c"><name>3986</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Fall gardening workshop set for Saturday, August 28</title><summary>Join gardener Trish Hildinger for a lecture and demonstration workshop on “Planting the Thanksgiving Feast” at the UC Santa Cruz Farm on Saturday, August 28 from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.</summary><start-date>1282636800000</start-date><display-name>Fall gardening workshop set for Saturday, August 28</display-name><path>/2010/08/3986</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/08/3986</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282855519737</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1284755415655</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Martha Brown</name><title></title><phone>831-459-3376</phone><email>mtbrown@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/08/images/planting-out.350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/08/images/planting-out.350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>planting-out.350.jpg</name><display-name>planting-out.350.jpg</display-name><file-size>106333</file-size><width>350</width><height>244</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span class="prCaption">Gardeners get fall plants started in anticipation of a Thanksgiving harvest.

<p>Hinck's lab studies the molecular signals that control the development of mammary glands and how disruption of those signals can lead to breast cancer. She and her colleagues have identified breast tumor suppressors that regulate several critical pathways controlling cell proliferation and migration. Her current research focuses on developing therapeutic strategies to target these pathways.</p>
<p>"Breast cancer affects the lives of nearly 200,000 women every year. My laboratory is using the generous gift from the SCCBG to identify therapeutically relevant targets that may suppress tumor growth," Hinck said.</p>
<p>Forsberg studies the changes in cells that can lead to leukemia. Her work focuses on stem cells that give rise to the different kinds of blood cells in our bodies. The goal is to determine how disorganization of the genomic information in blood stem cells leads to cells that behave aberrantly and give rise to leukemia. Ultimately, understanding the differences between normal stem cells and cells that give rise to cancer will aid the development of specific and efficient cancer therapies.</p>
<p>Rubin's lab conducts biochemical studies of the retinoblastoma protein and its role in cancer. The retinoblastoma protein was originally identified as the root cause of a pediatric eye tumor, but it is now thought to be defective in almost all tumors. Rubin's research aims to understand how this protein normally controls the growth and division of cells and why it fails to function properly in cancer cells. <a href="3967.xml">Recent findings</a> from his lab shed new light on the molecular mechanisms involved in this process.</p>
The SCCBG has been supporting cancer research at UC Santa Cruz since 2005. The group holds several annual events to raise funds for the programs it supports, including a food and wine festival, the 7th Annual Gourmet Grazing on the Green, which will be held at Aptos Park on Saturday, September 25.

The structure and design of these pages reflect input from academic and staff personnel; students; alumni; and others.<br/>
<br/>
This is part of an ongoing comprehensive web improvement program, commissioned in late 2008 by Chancellor Blumenthal and CPEVC Kliger. Co-led by University Relations and Information Technology Services, this initiative also involves the adoption and implementation of an enterprise-wide system for managing website content, the development of clear guidelines for UCSC web sites, and an updated definition of web services supported centrally by the campus.<br/>
<br/>
These web enhancements are intended to aid efforts to promote UCSC's many strengths and distinctions; recruit students, faculty and staff; increase private financial support; and provide a clear, accessible information portal for faculty, staff, students, and others.<br/>
<br/>
In early September, the Humanities Division, two of its departments, and Porter College sites are scheduled to transition to the new design and architecture within the campus Web Content Management System (WCMS). Other partners in the pilot phase of this project will transition their sites in coming months.<br/>

Grinding the existing roadbed and resurfacing with new pavement will take place during the regular work day, with traffic control provided by flaggers and construction cones.<br/>
<br/>
Striping of the pavement is currently scheduled for next Wednesday and Thursday, September 1 and 2, weather permitting. Brief delays may occur as workers control traffic while paint is applied to the pavement.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for paying extra attention to the safety of workers involved in these activities.<br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Larry Pageler, TAPS Director </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c3cb19a98072704601456c99f6acaa6b"><name>eyh-conference</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC hosts science conference for girls on Saturday, October 9</title><summary>The 10th annual UCSC Expanding Your Horizons Conference for high school girls will take place on Saturday, October 9.</summary><keywords>Expanding Your Horizons, EYH, STEM, women in science</keywords><start-date>1283155200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC hosts science conference for girls</display-name><path>/2010/08/eyh-conference</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2010/08/eyh-conference</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1283185121591</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1283185436076</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>News Briefs</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2010/08/images/eyh-ambassadors.jpg</path><link>site://news/2010/08/images/eyh-ambassadors.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>eyh-ambassadors.jpg</name><display-name>eyh-ambassadors.jpg</display-name><file-size>60397</file-size><width>300</width><height>293</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Participants in the EYH Ambassadors program visited the UCSC Chemical Screening Center in December 2008.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Keynote speaker Danielle Feinberg of Pixar Animation Studios will explain the math and science behind movie-making</article-subhead><article-text><p>The 10th annual UCSC Expanding Your Horizons Conference for high school girls will take place on Saturday, October 9, on the UC Santa Cruz campus. Open to young women in grades 9 through 12 from throughout the Monterey Bay area, <a href="http://eyh.ucsc.edu">Expanding Your Horizons</a> (EYH) is a popular program designed to nurture enthusiasm for science and engineering through hands-on activities and interactions with women in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.</p>
<p>"We give girls a chance to engage in really fun activities and meet women who are passionate about their STEM careers," said Nancy Cox-Konopelski, director of the <a href="http://ace.ucsc.edu">Academic Excellence Program</a> at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The keynote speaker at this year's EYH conference will be Danielle Feinberg of Pixar Animation Studios, whose talk is titled "To Infinity and Beyond! The Math and Science Behind Movie Making." Feinberg will share the story of her experiences as one of the few women engineering students at Harvard and how she became director of photography at Pixar.</p>
<p>In hands-on workshops, participants will learn about topics such as how scientists use tags to track endangered species and how law enforcement uses DNA to solve crimes. Other workshops include "Glow Power," in which girls will build a luminescent solar window to power a circuit, and "Chemistry in Nature," which explores flavors, fragrances, and pharmaceuticals.</p>

The structure and design of these pages reflect input from faculty, staff, students, alumni, and&#160;others.<br/>
<br/>
This publication of these new pages is part of a comprehensive web improvement program, co-led by the campus's University Relations and Information&#160;Technology Services divisions. This initiative also involves the adoption and implementation of a campus-level content management&#160;system that will enable UCSC to more easily and effectively keep web content consistent and current.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the campus's "home" environment, Phase 1 of the project involves&#160;the Humanities Division, two of its&#160;academic departments, and Porter College; these other pilot sites were scheduled to transition to the new design and architecture&#160;in early September. Other partners in the early phase of this project will transition their sites to the new system in coming months.<br/>
<br/>
The new home page includes a suite of QuickStart pages, designed to contain audience-specific resources for current students, faculty and staff, UCSC alumni, prospective students, parents and other family members, and members of the Santa Cruz community.
