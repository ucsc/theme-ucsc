<p>There are more than 300 courses ranging from precalculus, to marine ecology, to the Start-up Entrepreneurship Academy, and anything UC Santa Cruz students need to graduate.</p>
<p>Extended again this year, UCSC staff and faculty get half off tuition to encourage professional and personal development. Students and staff can enroll up until the first day of classes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Summer is a unique time when classes are open to everyone,&#8221; said Monica Parikh, director of Summer Session. &#8220;Staff, community members, high school students eager to start their college education, and students from other universities can take advantage of remote courses this summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>With multiple sessions, summer allows ample time to study with top-notch faculty, while still having time to work and have fun. Information on Summer Session and course offerings is at <a href="https://summer.ucsc.edu">summer.ucsc.edu</a>.</p>

The Division of Student Success, and in particular its Slug Support office within the Dean of Students office, has been hard at work since, helping students with limited resources as they confront logistical problems complicated by the pandemic economy.<br/> <br/>&#8220;Many students have reported losing wages since so many businesses have shut down or they were working on campus and are unable to work remotely,&#8221; said Mariah Lyons, director of Slug Support.</p>
<h3>Tools for crisis</h3>
<p>The crisis has hit some students with multiple compounding challenges, Lyons said. One student (who uses the pronoun "they") reported losing a position as a nanny, so they couldn&#8217;t pay rent. They returned to their family home, but are still stuck in their lease here, and they can&#8217;t find a subleaser. A sibling has also returned to the family home, straining internet access for remote learning. <br/> <br/>&#8220;I have a student employee whose parents lost jobs in the hospitality industry,&#8221; said Gwynn Benner, assistant vice provost and managing director of the Student Success Equity Research Center. &#8220;Now her salary needs to support a family of four. There are millions of new unemployed people. Some of them are going to be our students&#8217; parents, uncles, aunts, and other family.&#8221;<br/> <br/>Slug Support reached into its toolkit of emergency financial and food assistance and has innovated new ways to help.<br/> <br/>&#8220;We have been able to provide a lot of financial awards from our emergency fund that have helped students bridge the gaps in rent, transportation home, and needed textbooks, among other needs,&#8221; Lyons said. &#8220;Additionally, we can purchase e-gift cards for students who aren't in Santa Cruz when they are food insecure, making it easier to support students remotely.&#8221;<br/> <br/>Through connections with student assistance offices at other UC campuses, Slug Support has helped students in distant locations find needed services.</p>
<h3>Emerging support</h3>
Many students relied on campus libraries and computer labs to do coursework and to study, Lyons noted. Slug Support is working with Benner to organize the new Slug Tech program to lend laptops and cable modems. <br/> <br/>Computer networking company Netgear donated 300 cable modems to the new program. And the <a href="https://giving.ucsc.edu/donor-profiles/creating-opportunities/">Jacques M. Littlefield Foundation</a>, a previous supporter of the First Generation Initiative, came forward to help purchase new computers.<br/> <br/>&#8220;The foundation emailed me, saying, &#8217;We&#8217;re here for you. What do you need?&#8217;&#8221; Benner said. &#8220;The following week they sent funds for us to purchase Dell and MacBook Air laptops for students in need. It was a tremendous gift.&#8221; <br/> <br/>More than 500 donors have given to an emergency <a href="https://ucscslugsupport.communityfunded.net/">COVID-19 Slug Support Campaign</a> as of May 1, raising more than $150,000. <br/> <br/>While making their own shift to remote work, Slug Support&#8217;s staff of four case managers began responding to a rapidly growing number of requests for help. The team is fielding as many as three times the typical number of cases, Lyons said. <br/> <br/>&#8220;The Slug Support case managers are amazing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Our team had to quickly adapt to a remote service and set up ways to still provide crisis services to students. We have been able to set up a full-service remote program in a short amount of time.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/covid-19</url><title>UCSC responds to the pandemic</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d14d153b8072701751192fa60eb7bee4"><name>holl-trees</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Planting trees is no panacea for climate change, says ecologist </title><summary>Restoration ecologist Karen Holl has a simple message for anyone who thinks planting 1 trillion trees will reverse the damage of climate change: "We can't plant our way out of climate change."</summary><keywords>climate, trees, trillion, ecology, environment, tropical restoration</keywords><start-date>1588834800000</start-date><display-name>Holl-Trillion Trees</display-name><path>/2020/05/holl-trees</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/05/holl-trees</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1588354422046</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1589386106089</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/holl-trees_375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/holl-trees_375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>holl-trees_375.jpg</name><display-name>holl-trees_375.jpg</display-name><file-size>55820</file-size><width>375</width><height>249</height></image><image-alt>Close-up photo of a tree being planted</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/holl-trees_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/holl-trees_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>holl-trees_80.jpg</name><display-name>holl-trees_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>8350</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Close-up photo of a tree being planted</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>"Trees are deeply entrenched in the human psyche," says Karen Holl.

<p>"We can't plant our way out of climate change," says Holl, professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz and a leading expert in <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/03/holl-science.html">forest restoration</a>. &#8220;It is only one piece of the puzzle.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a commentary that appears in the May 8 issue of <em>Science</em>, Holl and coauthor Pedro Brancalion, a professor in the Department of Forest Sciences at the University of S&#227;o Paulo, endorse the benefits of trees but caution against a simplistic view of tree-planting as a panacea for environmental degradation.</p>
<p>"Trees are deeply entrenched in the human psyche," said Holl, a restoration ecologist who has <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/03/holl-primer.html">prepared hundreds of students</a> for careers in environmental stewardship. "It's very satisfying to go out and put a tree in the ground. It's a concrete, tangible thing to do."</p>
<p>But broad-scale tree planting initiatives, such as <a href="https://www.1t.org/">1t.org</a> and the <a href="https://www.trilliontreecampaign.org/">Trillion Tree Campaign</a>, must be undertaken carefully and with a commitment to long-term management, if the benefits are to be fully realized.</p>
<p>"Planting trees is not a simple solution," said Holl. "It's complicated, and we need to be realistic about what we can and cannot achieve. We need to be thoughtful and plan for the long term."</p>
<p>On the plus side, planting trees can improve biodiversity, water quality, and increase shade. But depending on where and how it is done, tree planting can also harm native ecosystems and species, reduce water supply, and dispossess local landholders and increase social inequity.</p>
<p>In their commentary, Holl and Brancalion present four principles that should guide forest enhancement initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduce forest clearing and degradation</strong>: Protecting and maintaining intact forests is more efficient, more ecologically sound, and less costly than planting trees, or replanting.</li>
<li><strong>View tree planting as one part of multifaceted environmental solutions</strong>: Enhanced tree cover is one of the best options to offset a portion of the greenhouse gas emissions driven by human activities, but they represent only a small portion of the carbon reductions that are needed&#8212;and estimates vary by more than tenfold depending on variables used in modeling.</li>
<li><strong>Balance ecological and social goals</strong>: Acknowledge competing land uses and focus on landscapes with the potential to generate large-scale benefits, such as the Atlantic Forest in Brazil, where regional planning of tree planting initiatives can lead to three times the conservation gains at half the cost.</li>
<li><strong>Plan, coordinate, and monitor</strong>: Work with local stakeholders to resolve conflicting land-use goals and ensure maximum effectiveness over the long term. Planting trees doesn't ensure they will survive; a review of mangrove forest restoration efforts in Sri Lanka following the 2004 tsunami showed fewer than 10 percent of trees survived in 75 percent of sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be successful, tree-planting initiatives need to engage local stakeholders and confront conflicting goals for land use. "Much of the land proposed for tree planting is already being used to grow crops, harvest timber, and other subsistence activities, so tree planting initiatives need to consider how landowners will earn income," said Holl. "Otherwise, activities such as agriculture or logging will just move to other lands"</p>
<p>Holl chooses her words carefully when she says she applauds the widespread enthusiasm for "increasing forest cover," which is not the same thing as planting more trees.</p>
<p>"The first thing we can do is keep existing forests standing, and the second is to allow trees to regenerate in areas that were formerly forests," said Holl, who specializes in tropical forest restoration. "In many cases, trees will recover on their own&#8212;just look at the entire eastern United States that was deforested 200 years ago. Much of that has come back without actively planting trees. Yes, in some highly degraded lands we will need to plant trees, but that should be the last option since it is the most expensive and often is not successful. I've spent my life on this. We need to be thoughtful about how we bring the forest back."</p>
<p>Critically, slowing the pace of climate change requires a comprehensive strategy that starts with burning less fossil fuel, said Holl.</p>
<p>"Trees are a small piece of what needs to be a broader strategy," said Holl. "We're better off not releasing greenhouse gases to begin with."</p>

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The HSCC Test-of-Time Award recognizes work published </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">at least ten years earlier</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> at the HSCC conference that has proven to be the most visionary and impactful, leading to new directions of research being initiated, or new applications being brought into the hybrid systems research community. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Sanfelice, who directs the <a href="https://cps.soe.ucsc.edu/">Cyber-Physical Systems Research Center</a> at </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">the <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, specializes in the analysis and design of algorithms for hybrid dynamical systems, in which continuous and discrete variables interact, and cyber-physical systems, which depend on the seamless integration of computational algorithms and physical components.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The Test-of-Time Award recognizes </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">a 2006</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> paper </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">by Sanfelice and coauthors Rafal Goebel, now at Loyola University Chicago, and Andrew Teel at UC Santa Barbara: "A Feedback Control Motivation for Generalized Solutions to Hybrid Systems." </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The HSCC committee noted that the paper &#8220;establishes that the so-called &#8216;hybrid basic conditions&#8217; necessary for robustness analysis of hybrid feedback control systems can be equivalently formalized as the limit of solutions under arbitrarily small measurement noise and disturbances. These results are now viewed as foundational extension of the concept of generalized solutions for discontinuous differential equations to hybrid control systems.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Sanfelice is currently working to develop mathematical models to describe the spread of COVID-19 in various populations around the world and under different conditions.

<p dir="ltr"><span>UC Santa Cruz continues to be defined in the order as an essential business, and activities we undertake for purposes of facilitating remote learning or performing essential activities are allowed, provided that people wear face coverings and that physical distancing of six-feet between persons is maintained to the greatest extent possible. There are new protocols outlined in the order regarding physical distancing and we are working to ensure we are in compliance. We are also reviewing the various aspects of the order to determine if there are any additional adjustments needed to our operations.

The proposed policy substantively revises the existing policy and Procedures on Curation and Repatriation of Human Remains and Cultural Items (&#8220;Current Policy&#8221;). The policy pertains to the treatment and repatriation of Native American and Native Hawaiian human remains and cultural items under the University&#8217;s stewardship and the University&#8217;s compliance with the Federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (&#8220;NAGPRA&#8221;), its accompanying regulations, and the California Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (&#8220;CalNAGPRA&#8221;).&#160;</p>
<p>California AB 2836 (enacted in 2018 and now incorporated into CalNAGPRA) requires the University to revise its Current Policy. In collaboration with the Cultural Affiliation and Repatriation Policy Advisory Workgroup (&#8220;Workgroup&#8221;)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a> established by Provost Michael Brown, UC developed Version 1 of this revised policy (&#8220;Policy Version 1&#8221;), which underwent systemwide review in August 2019. Policy Version 1 was also distributed to stakeholders across California for comment, including California Native American tribes on the Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC) contact list and the NAHC itself. With the Workgroup, UC drafted a second version of this revised policy (&#8220;Policy Version 2&#8221;) in response to the feedback from the Academic Senate, Native American tribes, and the NAHC. UC then engaged in further consultation with California Native American tribes by inviting them to attend four public work sessions on UC campuses (UC Berkeley, UC Riverside, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Davis) in January and February 2020. In addition, UC representatives met with tribes one-on-one as requested to hear individual concerns. UC deliberated with the Workgroup to discuss concerns raised during the public work sessions, the one-on-one meetings, and letters sent by tribes and the NAHC. In conjunction with the Workgroup, UC drafted &#8220;Policy Version 3,&#8221; which is now being considered for systemwide review. Please visit <a href="http://ucal.us/nagpra">http://ucal.us/nagpra</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the significant changes present in Policy Version 3 from the Current Policy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Creates a list of principles that emphasize the repatriation of Native American and Native Hawaiian human remains as a fundamental objective and value of the University.</li>
<li>Reconstitutes the Systemwide Committee and Campus Committees, if necessary, to include equal Native American representation.</li>
<li>Shifts final approvals of repatriation to the campus from UCOP to reduce delays in repatriation; the Systemwide Committee and UCOP will provide an oversight role and hear appeals of campus decisions.</li>
<li>Provides a detailed description of the Repatriation process via a Flowchart and Flowchart Narrative.</li>
<li>Provides a detailed description of the Consultation process all campuses must use when engaging with Native American tribes.</li>
<li>Requires campuses with NAGPRA/CalNAGPRA-eligible Cultural Items to appoint a Repatriation Coordinator to work with and assist Native American tribes to facilitate Repatriation.</li>
<li>Incorporates a process for disposition of Culturally Unidentifiable Human Remains and Cultural Items to either federally recognized tribes or non-federally recognized tribes (including California Indian Tribes) via NAGPRA (43 C.F.R. &#167;10.11) and/or CalNAGPRA (Ca H&amp;SC &#167;&#167;8010-30).</li>
<li>Requires campuses create repatriation implementation plans including the following elements: invitations for consultation and proactive reevaluations of all previous determinations of culturally unidentifiable human remains or associated funerary objects; outreach to culturally affiliated tribes; outreach to controlling agencies to prompt and encourage their repatriation efforts; budgets; and timelines.</li>
<li>Prohibits research, instruction, destructive analysis, and other manipulation without tribal approval requirements.</li>
<li>Provides a more robust mechanism for tribes to appeal campus determinations.</li>
<li>Provides a means for tribes to submit complaints about the consultation process or access.</li>
<li>Provides direction for whistleblowers that would like to report noncompliance with this policy.</li>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the world&#8217;s leading disease detectives, Joe DeRisi (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crown '92, biochemistry and molecular biology), </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has spent his professional life studying and fighting viruses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among DeRisi&#8217;s crowning achievements was inventing the ViroChip, a device that played an instrumental role in assisting with the identification of the deadly SARS coronavirus in 2003.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet DeRisi, for all of his long history on the front lines of virus research, has never seen anything quite like COVID-19.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s unique in the sense that it&#8217;s truly global, because it's impacting everyone in so many ways," DeRisi said. "In my experience, there is nothing like it.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, DeRisi, a soft-spoken professor of biochemistry and biophysics at UC San Francisco, is one of the leading scientists in the fight against the novel coronavirus, helming a massive effort to ramp up state-of-the-art clinical laboratory testing for COVID-19 throughout California, while pioneering large-scale testing in Bay Area communities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Laboring in the limelight</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeRisi has been in the limelight before&#8212;he&#8217;s a MacArthur Foundation &#8220;Genius Award&#8221; recipient who has given high-profile TED Talks about his virology investigations. Drawing from the training he received at a science communications class at UC Santa Cruz, DeRisi has gained a following with his complex, yet accessible and entertaining, TED Talk presentations. He also made a splash in 2018 with the launch of IDseq, a cloud-based, open-sourced platform that uses metagenomic sequencing to track and respond to infectious outbreaks especially in low- and middle-income countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But his recent COVID work has given him an even higher profile. In a feature story for Bloomberg.com, the bestselling author Michael Lewis profiled him in a story titled, &#8220;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-17/chan-zuckerberg-biohub-is-ready-for-coronavirus-tests-to-come">Notes From a Pandemic: The COVID test lab that could save America</a>.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is also part of a public-private partnership that could serve as a model for COVID testing across the globe. The lab, known as the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, has shared its expertise with &#8220;pop-up&#8221; testing labs at his alma mater UC Santa Cruz and UC Santa Barbara, and gave guidance to UC Berkeley on how to start its own lab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeRisi is copresident of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, created with the help of $600 million from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan. Priscilla, a pediatrician, first encountered DeRisi as a medical student at UCSF. He gave a lecture about his work using DNA microarrays and metagenomic sequencing to identify any virus, in any sample, whether or not it had been studied before.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chan never forgot that talk, and realized that DeRisi would be an essential partner for her Biohub project with Zuckerberg, with its audacious goal of wiping out all diseases in the 21st century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Chan and Zuckerberg&#8217;s high-profile backing, and the remarkable efforts of 200 volunteers, mostly UCSF graduate students, DeRisi was able to convert adjacent vacant UCSF lab space to a fully functioning, clinically certified COVID-19 testing lab in only eight days. This fast timeline was a high priority for the state government. In fact, an executive order from Governor Gavin Newsom got the project in motion, around the time when the governor started issuing strict shelter-in-place orders to &#8220;flatten the curve&#8221; of coronavirus in California.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the Biohub&#8217;s unique structure, a private-public partnership that blends high tech with open-source scientific practices, &#8220;we can be flexible, we can be nimble,&#8221; DeRisi said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everyone pretty much dropped everything they were doing to help. The [UCSF campus] lab had shut down, so we had this huge population of incredibly well-trained molecular biologists just itching to get into the fight," he continued. "We had our first hundred volunteers in just a week.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Testing game-changer</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the lab runs nearly 24 hours a day, with shifts of UCSF volunteers processing the tests, all supported by a team of Biohub scientists, including data scientists, engineers, and molecular biologists.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results have already been game-changing for COVID-19 testing in California. As soon as it was up and running, the lab had the capacity to process more than 2,600 free tests a day in nine Bay Area counties. Most patient samples arrive from nearby hospitals and public health laboratories.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the lab is offering free testing to every department of health in California.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s important, because those departments are the ones that serve people in nursing homes, prisons, and other vulnerable populations,&#8221; said DeRisi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, supply shortfalls for nasal swabs have prevented the counties from taking full advantage of all that free testing, however that is changing with supplies of collection kits becoming more plentiful.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that massive amount of testing is just one facet of DeRisi&#8217;s far-ranging battle against COVID. The lab is now entering a new phase as it undertakes large-scale testing of Bay Area communities including the San Francisco Mission District, and Berkeley. Indeed, during the last week of April, the Biohub testing lab processed over 4000 samples.&#160; Among the first of these community projects was a survey of the residents of Bolinas, a small West Marin community.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were able to do that in just a couple of days," he said. &#8220;That study was really the training wheels, to figure out where the wrinkles were when you&#8217;re doing community surveillance.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said he didn&#8217;t see the swab limitation early on, and he's "kicking myself for not buying up a million swabs in December. We&#8217;ve learned a lot of lessons in the global supply chain. But those limitations are getting ironed out.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeRisi is careful not to anthropomorphize the coronavirus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think of it as a foe with intelligence," he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s basically an evolved little machine that has leaked into our population. It is a foe that we are up against, but it is tractable. I am very optimistic [about the fight against COVID-19]. How long will it take? How rough will it be? Nobody knows, but we have the tools.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>The class that changed his life</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeRisi has had plenty of training in battles against other deadly viruses. Aside from his work identifying many disease-causing viruses that plague humans, he&#8217;s also identified scourges that afflict a variety of animals, including sharks, snakes, and numerous species of birds.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even before getting tested in the front lines of these virus wars, DeRisi learned valuable, and sometimes painful, lessons about problem solving, deadlines, and troubleshooting while taking an intensive 10-week lab course at UC Santa Cruz with Harry Noller, professor emeritus of MCD biology and winner of the 2016 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that class, DeRisi learned an important truth about lab work and scientific inquiry: Learning and coming back from failure is an essential part of that process.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also learned how to build a lab from scratch under an extremely tight deadline, a feat he would re-create when &#8220;sprinting&#8221; to get his testing lab up and running at UCSF.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We threw the students into the deep end of the pool and watched what happened," Noller recalled. &#8220;The lab was open to them 24/7. You could find them working at nights and on weekends. There were wild celebrations and tearful breakdowns. Many students formed lifelong bonds.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that course, &#8220;Joe was clearly exceptional," said Noller. "His excitement and curiosity were infectious.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only that, but DeRisi passed the most critical test in the class that quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;His experiments worked!&#8221; Noller said. &#8220;He was a joy to have as a student. It has been a pleasure to see him emerge as a world leader in the field of molecular virology.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Sharing the method&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, DeRisi and his colleagues are working hard to finish up a manuscript that will serve as a guidebook and a chronicle of everything they have done to ramp up COVID testing. The book will be technical, making it easier for labs all over the world to replicate his work at UCSF. This is part of DeRisi&#8217;s "open source" philosophy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we did at the lab is organizationally complex, but it&#8217;s also nimble," he said. &#8220;Our structure allows us to pivot on a dime.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This book will spill all the secrets of this private-public partnership, and what it has been able to achieve in such a short time. The philosophy will be "you can do it too."</span></p>

At the time, it was a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/nanopore-genome.html">monumental effort</a>, requiring 150,000 hours of computing time and weeks of work.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">About a year later, using the PromethION nanopore sequencer, a <a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/efficient-de-novo-assembly-of-eleven-human-genomes-using-promethion-sequencing-and-a-novel-nanopore-toolkit/">similar effort</a> proved significantly faster, cheaper, and easier, clocking in at about a week. "We sequenced eleven human genomes in nine days, which was unprecedented at the time," said UC Santa Cruz Research Scientist Miten Jain.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Now, researchers at UC Santa Cruz have collaborated on an algorithm designed to accurately and precisely assemble individual, complete human genomes from long-read sequencing data in about six hours and for about $70.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The researchers said they hope their assembler will increase the pace of genomics research and open opportunities. This includes enabling pangenome research to represent the true scale of human diversity, a decidedly more practical pursuit.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Until recently, genomic research has relied exclusively on the reference genome from a single individual selected to represent an entire species. To reflect true human diversity, UC Santa Cruz has embarked on a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/09/pangenome-project.html">pangenomic initiative</a> to sequence 350 new, individual human genomes.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">As part of this work, </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">researchers at the </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a> developed a nanopore long-read sequencing protocol that consistently yields </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">about </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">60X coverage (</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">about </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">200 gigabases) of a human genome at unprecedented lengths (median read of 42 k</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">ilobases</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">) using three PromethION flow cells. Additionally, </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">about </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">7X coverage of the genome is in reads exceeding 100 k</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">ilobases</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> in length. This method is highly scalable, both in terms of cost and the number of genomes that can be processed simultaneously. </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The team is</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> now improving this method for higher read lengths and throughput, which will further facilitate </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">the</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> goal of achieving complete, phased, reference-quality genomes.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">This large inflow of data necessitated the development of highly efficient software tools, starting with an assembler. "Our new assembler was designed to be cheap and quick, with the goal to be on the cloud," said Benedict Paten, </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at UCSC</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">. "It gives us the power to scale nanopore sequencing. Now, I'm confident that we'll be easily assembling hundreds of de novo genomes in the next couple of years."</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">An extensive team of researchers and developers that was led by Paolo Carnevali from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), and included many </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">researchers</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> at the </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Genomics Institute&#8217;s</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> Computational Genomics Lab, contributed to this solution.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"When I saw </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Miten</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> Jain&#8217;</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">s</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> 2018 paper, I was impressed and realized that I could contribute to the computational side of this line of investigation," Carnevali </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">said</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">. "I had recently met Benedict Paten and decided I wanted to work with his team at UCSC.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The team were soon collaborating. Within months, they had developed and tested the special algorithmic sauce, which they called Shasta.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Shasta is an in-memory computing-driven algorithm that can now help complete a de novo (new, never before processed) human genome assembly in under six hours, the authors say, for an average cost of $70 per sample.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">a paper</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0503-6">published </a></span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0503-6"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">May 4</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> in </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Nature Biotechnology</i></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, they describe how Shasta not only yields comparable or better accuracy as its contemporaries but also has the lowest number of misassemblies.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Not satisfied with this milestone, the team saw an opportunity to improve the draft assembly at an affordable cost and turn-around time. "To improve the base-level quality of the assemblies, we used a sequence polisher based on a deep neural network as the final assembly step," explained </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">lead</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> author Kishwar Shafin, </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">a graduate student </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">in Paten&#8217;s group</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">. "This brought the total cost of the assembly process to less than $200 and 37 hours, which further reduced the computational overhead of generating long-read assemblies dramatically, by a factor of five."</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The researchers assessed the precision and then validated the accuracy, and noted that they had achieved 99.9% accurate assembly using only nanopore data, a first for the human genome. Further, they generated chromosome-level scaffolds for these polished assemblies using HiC sequencing data.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Research scientist and co-author Karen Miga, who is directing the Data Production Center at UCSC for the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/09/pangenome-project.html">Human Pangenome Project</a>, points out the significance of the team's achievements in improved accuracy. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"Our aim is not only to expand the diversity of the reference genome but also to resolve the hundreds of gaps that persist across the genome," Miga </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">said</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">. "Now that we can routinely include these uncharted regions, we have a truly complete assembly of a human genome, and we can begin to explore variations of unknown consequence."</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e1219dc88072701751192fa684b1efa3"><name>remaining-inclusive-even-while-apart</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Remaining inclusive, even while apart</title><summary>We want to start this message by acknowledging the camaraderie, compassion, and generosity of spirit that the UC Santa Cruz community has largely shown over the past several weeks</summary><start-date>1588575600000</start-date><display-name>Remaining inclusive, even while apart</display-name><path>/2020/05/remaining-inclusive-even-while-apart</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/05/remaining-inclusive-even-while-apart</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1588620008858</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594758397881</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>Dear Banana Slugs,</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We want to start this message by acknowledging the camaraderie, compassion, and generosity of spirit that the UC Santa Cruz community has largely shown over the past several weeks. Despite everyone being physically separated, students, faculty, and staff have been creatively finding ways to connect with and support one another during these extraordinarily difficult times, even while struggling and facing challenges related to this pandemic themselves.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It is disheartening that even in the midst of a public health crisis, Asian and Asian-American members of our campus community endure racist, xenophobic, and hate-filled messages or interactions while trying to study or work at the university.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Many students, staff, and faculty have also shared their experiences of being harassed because of their identity when they are online or while on essential trips to the grocery store, pharmacy and medical office, layered on top of worrying that they or their loved ones will contract COVID-19, attending to a full workload, and adjusting to working remotely. This is hurtful and disruptive.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We condemn all of these actions (whether they take place on or off campus) and implore every member of our community to think about how their words and actions might further impact others above and beyond the unprecedented challenges we already face in the midst of this pandemic. These actions cause real pain, and there is no place for them. The words that we use and the actions we take always matter, regardless of the space in which they occur.

<p>The unique, in-person survey reached 643 workers with Uber, Lyft, Doordash, GrubHub, Instacart, and Shipt early this year. When the shelter-in-place order took effect, researchers developed an additional two-week, online survey to capture the effects of the pandemic on app-based workers&#8212;a growing population that enjoys little job security and few employment rights.</p>
<p>The baseline survey reveals a workforce that is 56% immigrant, mostly male, and that struggles to make ends meet, with many relying on public assistance despite working an average of 40 hours per week. Since the pandemic, the online survey revealed, more than half have lost 75-100% of their income. The findings were published in a report titled, "<a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/on-demand-and-on-the-edge/">On-demand and on-the-edge: Ride-hailing and Delivery Workers in San Francisco</a>."</p>
<p>"This is an incredibly vulnerable workforce, and many were just on the edge before the coronavirus crisis," said lead researcher Chris Benner, a professor of environmental studies and sociology and the director of the Institute for Social Transformation at UCSC. "The crisis has put them over the edge. Because of their employment status, they fall through a lot of cracks in the relief packages that have been approved by the state and federal governments."</p>
<p>The initial survey was conducted over six weeks from February 1 through mid-March. Survey takers recruited participants through the apps themselves by hiring workers and asking if they'd like to participate. The 20-minute survey was administered in person, and those who participated received a $20 gift card. The response rate was 70% among ride-hailing workers and 15% among food-delivery workers.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the coronavirus crisis prompted the research team to pivot to an online survey, which was conducted the second and third weeks of April. Participants were recruited through organized networks, including closed Facebook groups, and a total of 219 app-based workers responded.</p>
<p>"We surveyed the same workforce at two different points in time," said Benner. "The first gives us a picture of these workers under normal work circumstances, and the second is a snapshot of the impacts of COVID on this workforce."&#160;</p>
<p><u>Full-time work but not enough to get by</u></p>
<p>The baseline survey, which reached 407 ride-hailing workers and 236 food-delivery workers, revealed a workforce on the margins:</p>
<ul>
<li>21% of participants have no health insurance, and another 30% depend on public insurance sources, such as Covered California or Medi-Cal</li>
<li>15% receive some form of public assistance, including 13% of food-delivery workers who depend on food stamps</li>
<li>45% report they could not handle a $400 emergency expense without borrowing money</li>
</ul>
<p>Half the participants report working 40 or more hours per week in app-based work, and nearly 40% have worked more than two years for their "survey app"&#8212;the app they were working on when recruited for the survey.</p>
<p>"This is not a 'gig.' This is full-time work for the majority of these workers," said Benner. "More than one-third are supporting children and nearly half are supporting other adults."</p>
<p>Respondents reported median weekly earnings of $900 for ride-hailing workers and $500 for food-delivery workers, but those earnings drop considerably when adjusted for expenses such as gas, vehicle service, and cleaning. And the gap between workers' own estimates of expenses, compared to per-mile expenses allowed by the IRS, is considerable: When using the IRS estimates, fully 21% of workers net zero for their labor, said Benner.</p>
<p>"We estimate that twenty percent of ride-hailing workers are actually losing money to drive, when you account for all of their expenses," said Benner.</p>
<p><u>Impacts of the coronavirus pandemic</u></p>
<p><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/04/benner-workforce.html">Preliminary findings</a> of the online survey, including the drop in income, were shared with the San Francisco Local Agency Formation Commission (SF LAFCo), which commissioned the baseline survey, on April 21.</p>
<p>"With the shelter-in-place order in effect, ride-hailing workers were earning a fraction of what they'd made in February, but these workers were living on the edge financially already, so anything they can bring in is necessary," said Benner.</p>
<p>The coronavirus crisis prompted 18% of surveyed ride-hailing workers to shift to food delivery, but the biggest impact was on those who were not working at all: 24% had stopped working by mid-April, for fear of contracting the virus or other reasons.</p>
<p>Because app-based companies continue to classify their workers as independent contractors, despite the passage in 2019 of California Assembly Bill 5 designed to make them employees, workers are not typically able to access unemployment benefits. Although the federal CARES Act expanded eligibility to some independent contractors, app-based workers have trouble providing the required documentation of their previous earnings, said Benner.</p>
<p><u>Policy implications</u></p>
<p>The two-pronged survey results shed light on the needs of app-based workers, particularly in a city like San Francisco, which has some of the most progressive fair-labor standards in the country, said Benner. "These workers need and deserve greater economic security," he said.</p>
<p>Policymakers must ensure that city and state employment laws are enforced, including minimum wage laws, and that ride-hailing and delivery workers have access to health insurance and unemployment benefits, said Benner. He added that the pandemic has exposed a need for improved safety and health protection of workers and paid sick leave, as well as stronger public health protections.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, owners of app-based companies are backing a ballot initiative that would exempt them from employer regulations. "At a time when these companies should be providing sanitizer, gloves, masks, and information about how to prevent the spread of the virus, they haven't been, because that would undermine their claim that these workers aren't their employees," said Benner. "Food and grocery delivery has been deemed essential work, and these workers are putting themselves at risk, but they are not getting adequate support or protection."</p>
<p><u>Assessing workers in the gig economy</u></p>
<p>The surge of app-based workers has raised questions about their well-being, their relationship to the companies they work for, and the future of the labor force. The baseline survey is among the most robust efforts to assess the circumstances of ride-hailing and grocery and meal-delivery workers.</p>
<p>"A survey like this is extremely rare, because it's expensive and labor-intensive," said Benner. "We paid the surveyors and the cost of the ride and meal, regardless of whether the worker was willing to participate in the survey." Benner acknowledged support from the San Francisco Foundation, ReWork the Bay, the Ford Foundation, the Annie E. Casey Foundation, Chavez Family Foundation, and SF LAFCo.</p>
<p>The survey was administered by UC Santa Cruz in partnership with San Francisco Jobs With Justice, Jobs With Justice Education Fund, and the Driver&#8217;s Seat Cooperative. SF LAFCo commissioned the research. "This is a true example of community-engaged scholarship," said Benner.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undergraduate Education has announced that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Matt O&#8217;Hara has been named provost of </span><a href="https://stevenson.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adlai E.

Porter College</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both appointments are effective July 1.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Stevenson College</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Matt O&#8217;Hara has been named provost of </span><a href="https://stevenson.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adlai E. Stevenson College</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, effective July 1. He served as co-provost in the current academic year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O&#8217;Hara is a professor in the Department of History, where he is currently chair. He also served as the campus Faculty Director of Undergraduate Honors from 2014-2019. He joined UC Santa Cruz in 2006.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O&#8217;Hara said his vision for Stevenson College is to maintain and bolster its unique two-quarter core course, &#8220;Self and Society,&#8221; to help its students gain practical research experience and explore internship opportunities, and to encourage Stevenson students to develop intellectual interests across a range of academic fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m very excited to be stepping into this role,&#8221; O&#8217;Hara said, &#8220;above all because of the outstanding people already working at the college, including a team of expert staff and instructors. While serving with provost Yang over the past year, I&#8217;ve come to know Stevenson students, staff, and faculty, and I look forward to working with them, especially as we respond to the challenges of the current year.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grounded in archival documents, O&#8217;Hara&#8217;s research investigates the relationship between individual agency and structural forces, especially the cultures of knowledge surrounding religion and science. O&#8217;Hara&#8217;s previous books delved into early Mexican political culture, religion, and the history of time. These publications included the book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Flock Divided: Race, Religion and Politics in Mexico </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Duke University Press, 2010). He recently published </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The History of the Future in Colonial Mexico </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Yale University Press, 2018), which examined how early modern science and religion shaped the human experience of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His current research unearths a twentieth-century history of exploration, botany, and pharmaceutical development. Reconstructing events that moved from jungle laboratories in the Amazon to coerced medical experimentation in the United States, this transnational history draws on archives scattered across the United States, Peru, and Ecuador.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education noted that O&#8217;Hara has also led our campus&#8217; College Scholars program, a first- and second-year program for entering and continuing students in the colleges, and that he will be following the exemplary service of Provost Alice Yang, who has always instilled a strong sense of community across the students, staff, faculty, and alumni of our campus&#8217; second college.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Stevenson College provost, O&#8217;Hara will oversee academic programs, including the core course component of the Academic Literacy Curriculum, service learning courses, and the awarding of degrees. He will also serve on the Council of Provosts, the body that continuously focuses on student outcomes and experiences within the colleges, the campus&#8217;s distinctive communities of scholarship.</span></p>
<p><strong>Porter College</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate Professor Gerald Casel has been named provost of </span><a href="https://porter.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benjamin F. Porter College</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, effective July 1.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gerald Casel is an associate professor of Dance and associate chair of the Theater Arts Department. He is also artistic director of GERALDCASELDANCE, a dance company he founded in 1998 in New York City, committed to creating and presenting experimental dance works that provoke questions about human beings &#8211; who we are, what we do, and how our actions affect the world in which we live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casel&#8217;s vision for Porter College includes innovative ideas that increase equity on many levels &#8211; from educational opportunities, to learning outcomes, and other activities and events that promote a sense of deep belonging. He says, &#8220;as a first-generation, educator-of-color working in a Hispanic serving institution, it is my obligation to make sure students who have been disadvantaged due to their social position or ethno-racial background have access to opportunities and resources that will lead to their success.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I believe in collaborating with my colleagues and community to identify and eliminate systems of inequity that bring about structural change,&#8221; Casel said. &#8220;I look forward to working with students, staff, and faculty across departments to see what is working when it comes to student success &#8211; including abandoning policies that no longer serve our shared goals.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last few years, Casel has focused on advancing diversity and equity through his work with the San Francisco Arts Commission alongside the Human Rights Commission.

Your commitment and ability to build communities of learning across distance continues to inspire me and makes me proud to be a member of the UC Santa Cruz community</span><br/><br/><strong>Budget Impacts and Uncertainty<br/></strong><br/><span>There are a number of factors that will contribute to the fiscal impacts on our campus and California as a result of COVID-19. We do not yet know what kinds of instruction will be possible in the fall; we cannot forecast with any certainty how our operations will look as we start our next academic year; and we do not yet know our fall enrollments. The state budget for the next fiscal year and the associated investment in the University of California will not be known until at least September. This period of budget uncertainty and concerns about revenue losses will likely continue beyond the 2020-21 academic year. In addition, depending on the future trajectory of COVID-19 and the potential for resurgence, there could be additional waves of impact. In order to prepare for a variety of scenarios that could emerge, we are deeply engaged in developing plans that provide good fiscal, public health, and safety stewardship and will continue to develop, refine and share these plans as information becomes available.</span><br/><br/><strong>Workforce Planning<br/></strong><br/><span>This high degree of budget uncertainty has led to concern about layoffs. As you know, President Naplitano and the 10 campus Chancellors sent out a communication in March stating a commitment to no COVID-19 related layoffs through the rest of the current fiscal year. At this point we do not have enough budget information to say definitively what may happen in regard to layoffs after July 1, 2020. I know this message does not bring reassurance, but I offer it in the spirit of transparency. Many have asked if voluntary pay cuts or similar actions could be implemented to minimize the potential for layoffs or other budget cuts. All of these possibilities are on the table. We are working with the Office of the President and the other UC campuses to coordinate efforts to address potential budget shortfalls.</span><br/><br/><strong>CARES Act Funding<br/></strong><br/><span>Universities and colleges are receiving limited federal funding to assist with the fiscal impact of COVID-19. Through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, UC Santa Cruz has been allocated $19.3 million. Federal guidelines state that these funds must go toward expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to coronavirus. One-half of these funds must be awarded directly to students in the form of emergency financial aid grants. Students will receive a follow-up email explaining this process. The remaining half (approximately $9.6M) are to cover costs associated with significant changes to the delivery of instruction. Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer, working with the academic leadership team, will recommend how these funds should be directed per federal guidelines. I share with others the hope that there will be additional COVID-19 federal legislation, but it is not yet clear what kinds of financial relief will come to the University of California or UC Santa Cruz. The campus is also tracking all expenses for other kinds of support, through agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).</span><br/><br/><strong>Planning for Recovery<br/></strong><br/><span>Though we face uncertainty about many elements of our operations, we are actively engaging in planning to identify how we can and should respond based on various scenarios. As part of this work, I have asked the campus leadership team to think through how their operations and finances would be impacted by various scenarios including permanent campus budget reductions of 5, 10 and 15 percent. I have also asked them to identify the opportunities for revenue generation or other operational efficiencies that could mitigate possible budget cuts. We are developing a set of principles to guide this work so that our mission and goals continue to guide our budget decisions. We will share information about these principles as this work continues.</span><br/><br/><strong>Recovery and Resiliency Committee Structure<br/></strong><br/><span>Scenario planning is the basis for the recovery and resiliency work moving forward in response to COVID-19. The health and safety of our campus community is our top priority in this work.

The focus of this group is on community and morale, how we return to work, how people navigate the fears and uncertainties of returning to work, and how we leverage opportunities that have emerged over the last couple of months. This work includes identifying how we can return to work safely and the many issues that relate to resumption of business. As these groups identify recommendations, I have asked them to share information with the campus community.</span><br/><br/><span>I know this period of isolation and uncertainty is difficult.

<p>Rogoff and co-presenters Andrew Coppens, Rebeca Mej&#237;a-Arauz, Ang&#233;lica L&#243;pez-Fraire, and Luc&#237;a Alcal&#225;, all of whom earned PhDs from UC Santa Cruz, created a 3-minute research video entitled &#8220;Learning to Collaborate.&#8221; The video shows that cultural differences in how parents include toddlers in everyday work may support children&#8217;s interest and skill in collaboration&#8212;a skill that is valuable for learning. The researchers submitted the video as part of NSF&#8217;s annual competition showcasing innovative ways to improve learning of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, the so-called STEM fields.</p>
<p>The video, based on interviews with California mothers, highlights the ways that many Mexican-heritage families in the United States include even the youngest children in family work. As Mexican-heritage children reach middle childhood, they are often more likely to voluntarily pitch in to help than middle-class European American children, whose families generally try to discourage toddlers&#8217; involvement in family work.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Mexican-heritage mothers generally appreciate even 2-year-olds&#8217; involvement as help, even though the help may require some fixing up,&#8221; said Rogoff. The Mexican-heritage families&#8217; encouragement of collaboration in early childhood could lay the groundwork for successful collaboration in classrooms and informal settings, and aid national efforts to broaden children&#8217;s participation in science, according to the researchers.</p>
<p>Rogoff&#8217;s video is available for voting through May 12 at NSF&#8217;s competition website. Viewers are invited to vote for their favorite video and join the online discussion of the videos, at<u> <a href="http://stemforall2020.videohall.com/p/1676">http://stemforall2020.videohall.com/p/1676</a></u>.</p>
<p>Videos from Rogoff&#8217;s research team have taken top awards in the previous four years. The videos, about skilled collaboration, helpfulness, and keen observation, remain available for viewing at NSF&#8217;s Stem for All Multiplex, <a href="https://multiplex.videohall.com/">https://multiplex.videohall.com/</a></p>
<p>Now in its sixth year, the NSF showcase features over 170 innovative projects aimed at improving STEM learning and teaching.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Dear Campus Community,</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act signed into law in early April provides UC Santa Cruz with $19.3 million to mitigate the financial impact of the pandemic on the university and its students. At least half of the institution&#8217;s allocation will go directly to students via the Financial Aid and Scholarships Office (FASO) to help with expenses related to COVID-19, including costs for housing, food, course materials, technology, health care, and childcare. The remainder of the funding will mitigate unexpected university costs associated with transitioning to remote instruction and remote work, as well as loss of revenue associated with housing, among others.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The emergency financial aid grants will be </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>advanced directly to undergraduates and graduate students with the most need</strong></span><span> for their expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to the coronavirus, such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care, and child-care expenses.&#160; &#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In determining the principles for allocation of CARES Act grants, the FASO consulted with campus leaders, including the Student Union Assembly (SUA) and the Graduate Student Association (GSA), on how best to award funds within the Department of Education regulations. We chose not to require an additional application to ensure we can streamline the awarding process. Graduate students who have submitted a FAFSA to UCSC anytime since 2005 were considered eligible. </span><strong>Spring quarter awards will range from $500 to $1,400.</strong><span> Students identified for an award will receive an email in the next few days to ensure they have direct deposit set up. A few days later, the awards will be disbursed. In addition, CARES Act grant-eligible students who enroll in 6 or more credits in </span><span><strong>summer session will receive $500</strong>. </span><span>These are one-time grant awards that do not need to be paid back.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The campus will also provide awards aligned with the same principles and priorities to students who have submitted the </span><strong>California Dream Application.&#160;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Any student </strong><span>(resident, international, out of state, undocumented, with or without a financial aid application, etc.)</span><span> </span><span>experiencing a financial emergency is encouraged to contact </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/slug-support/program/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1588785132244000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3EJ-h8OIV5jaNMcNJVq5OD08kPQ" href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/slug-support/program/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Slug Support.</span></a></p>

Council recognizes and is very sensitive to the fact that COVID-19 is in many cases exacerbating the already precarious position that many graduate students face regarding funding support. We also recognize that the COVID-19 situation is creating potentially &#160;significant financial challenges and uncertainties for the broader UCSC campus. Council will continue advocating for graduate students and graduate education to address these challenges at both the campus and systemwide level. As one example, Council is engaging with the systemwide Coordinating Committee on Graduate Affairs to pursue &#160;a temporary extension of the 6 year (18 quarter) limit on students holding a teaching assistant/teaching fellow title.&#160; We hope to communicate the results of this effort as well as &#160;additional outcomes in support of graduate students as these emerge.<br/><br/>---

<div>April 29, 2020 &#160; &#160;<br/><br/>DEPARTMENT/PROGRAM CHAIRS<br/><br/>FACULTY GRADUATE DIRECTORS<br/><br/>RE: COVID-19 Impacts on Graduate Education<br/><br/>Dear Colleagues,<br/><br/>Graduate Council is concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on graduate students, given their multiple and intersecting roles as students, researchers, teachers, and employees. Council&#8217;s concerns are underscored by comments and questions we have received from students and faculty across the campus broadly related to graduate student well-being and welfare. These concerns include how students are impacted by the loss of outside employment and/or their partner&#8217;s loss of employment, need for support for basic needs to address food and housing insecurity, and the availability of mental health services and support; challenges with accommodating the increased workload as they navigate to online teaching and support undergraduate learning; student concerns about progress on research, particularly for laboratory or human subjects-based research that has been halted; adapting to uncertainties in their ability to meet program milestones and completing degrees; suspension or loss of professional engagement and networking opportunities critical to their success; and the potential for a loss of funding. Often hidden is the differential impact of these issues across disciplines, highlighting the need to recognize disciplinary differences in student needs during this time. Graduate students of color and graduate women of color in particular are often a source of support for underrepresented minority undergraduate students, and disproportionately do the institutional service work to fill the gaps in undergraduate support needs for the campus.&#160; The campus provides some<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/slug-support/program/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1588891535113000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFUntOikQfyMX4XFuGpQ9zd9QlGFQ" href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/slug-support/program/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">services and resources</a><span>&#160;</span>that may mitigate the impacts of some of these issues on graduate students, and students should be encouraged to explore these options.<br/><br/>Graduate Council is especially committed to addressing the impacts of COVID-19 on graduate students and graduate education in areas within the Council&#8217;s authority. In order to better support graduate students and their academic progress, Graduate Council is temporarily implementing the following:<br/>
<ul>
<li>For current full-time doctoral students that have not yet advanced to candidacy, the Council is extending by one year the maximum amount of time to advance to candidacy before being deemed to be making unsatisfactory academic progress (see<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://senate.ucsc.edu/manual/santacruz-division-manual/part-three-appendices/appendix-d/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1588891535114000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHYflNVB4xIqPOAD2Pingw34llauw" href="https://senate.ucsc.edu/manual/santacruz-division-manual/part-three-appendices/appendix-d/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UCSC Academic Senate Manual Appendix D</a>, sections IV. F.).</li>
<li>For current full-time doctoral students that have already advanced to candidacy, extend by one year the maximum amount of time to complete their degree before being deemed to be making unsatisfactory academic progress (see<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://senate.ucsc.edu/manual/santacruz-division-manual/part-three-appendices/appendix-d/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1588891535114000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHYflNVB4xIqPOAD2Pingw34llauw" href="https://senate.ucsc.edu/manual/santacruz-division-manual/part-three-appendices/appendix-d/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UCSC Academic Senate Manual Appendix D</a>, section IV. G.).</li>
<li>For full-time master&#8217;s students extend by one year the number of calendar years of enrollment before being deemed to be making unsatisfactory academic progress (see<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://senate.ucsc.edu/manual/santacruz-division-manual/part-three-appendices/appendix-d/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1588891535114000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHYflNVB4xIqPOAD2Pingw34llauw" href="https://senate.ucsc.edu/manual/santacruz-division-manual/part-three-appendices/appendix-d/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UCSC Academic Senate Manual Appendix D</a>, section IV. H).</li>
<li>These extensions will increase by one year the normative (i.e., maximum) time to degree for current full-time graduate students, as stipulated in Appendix D, Section IV. L.</li>
</ul>
In addition, Council recommends that, where appropriate departments/programs consider flexibility with program requirements to address the challenges faced by graduate students due to COVID-19, including:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Considering waiving GRE admissions requirements. While Council has previously (10/8/2019) announced that GRE scores are an optional requirement for admissions, at the discretion of and by vote of the program faculty, we encourage programs that still require the GRE to consider suspending that requirement for the 2020-21 admissions cycle, given that prospective student access to preparatory resources and testing opportunities may be limited.</li>
<li>Other temporary modifications to degree requirements. As indicated in earlier correspondence, (Graduate Council, CCI, and CEP 3/16/20), Council will consider requests for temporary modification of program degree requirements and modes of instruction to address &#160;emerging and exceptional needs for graduate students and programs during this time. &#160;</li>
<li>Programs are encouraged to be sensitive to the challenges students may face in meeting milestones set by the program by extending existing deadlines within the program&#8217;s purview, when appropriate.</li>
<li>Restrictions on international travel are evolving, creating uncertainties that will very likely impact the ability of incoming international students to attend the program in-person. Programs should monitor the situation closely and reach out to Graduate Council when needed to discuss proposals for temporary program modifications (as a reminder, all program degree modifications need to be approved by Graduate Council).</li>
</ul>
The UC/UCSC administration and Graduate Division, for their part, have ensured that graduate students who entered leave of absence status in spring quarter retained their GSHIP health insurance; and, first-year students who left the state due to COVID in the spring will still be eligible to qualify for California residency in the fall quarter. And, through the Dean of Students Office, SlugSupport has contributed extensive emergency financial support to graduate students.<br/><br/>There are other policy areas that are not within Council&#8217;s plenary authority, and where flexibility would greatly support graduate student education, research and teaching. Graduate Council is discussing ways in which it can collaborate with the broader Senate and with the administration in order to work toward encouraging solutions, at both the campus and systemwide level, to bring needed changes in support of the graduate enterprise.<br/><br/>We thank you for your continued engagement with Graduate Council, the broader Senate, campus administration, and with each other, as we collectively work to support our graduate students and the graduate enterprise overall. As Council continues to discuss these pressing issues, we will continue to communicate with the campus about further recommendations and temporary amendments to existing policy.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>&#160;<br/>Donald Smith, Chair, Graduate Council</div>

<p>The class of 2020 deserves a celebration. Our graduating seniors are demonstrating such resilience in the face of an unprecedented final year of college and have set an example for our campus of success and camaraderie. This is a group that will have many stories to tell at Alumni Weekends in the future and who we can't wait to welcome back to campus.</p>
<p>As I announced in early April, we will not be able to have an in-person commencement in June.

<p>The 13 main venue events are the 10 college commencement ceremonies, Black Grad, Chicanx Latinx Year-End Ceremony (CLYEC), and the Baskin School of Engineering Graduation Celebration. Participating in the remote events will not prevent anyone from participating in in-person celebrations later. The Graduate Division has elected to postpone the graduate hooding ceremony until it is safe to reconvene and will be in touch with graduate students with more information. The coordinator for your ceremony or celebration will be reaching out to provide additional information.<span>&#160;</span><strong>If you have not already registered, please make sure you complete the registration by 11:59 p.m. Sunday, May 10.

For any questions you have, please contact the<span>&#160;</span><a href="mailto:commencement@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">commencement team</a>.</p>
<p>The survey feedback from students was particularly useful in making this decision as more than 42% of respondents requested either a remote ceremony or a remote ceremony now and an in-person ceremony when it is possible. Many of the comments in the survey asked to ensure that there was an opportunity to celebrate for students and families who might not have the opportunity to return to campus soon because of financial constraints, employment, or moving to a new area. It was very moving to see so many students advocate for accessibility for their peers.</p>
<p>Students also told us what was most important to them about commencement with celebrating in person and on campus as two of the top considerations.<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/open?id%3D1oMCJsdEqGvxLevdNcOMD5ILG78gdGxTs&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1588893934328000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFHkKiJ-hGraUjonMnwTOEeMAbypw" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oMCJsdEqGvxLevdNcOMD5ILG78gdGxTs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">You can see a summary of the survey data here</a>. Both the Commencement Working Group and the Commencement Steering Committee will remain charged to help plan for a celebration when we can come back together in person. A Logistics Working Group has also been charged to help ensure that the celebration is safe and feasible. We expect to survey students again as we get closer to returning to in-person operations.</p>
<p>I want to thank the many staff and faculty members who have been hard at work to ensure that we can celebrate remotely in June and who will continue to work to bring us together in-person. Thank you all for bringing our community of learning off the hill and out into the world. We are looking forward to celebrating with you. Until then, stay safe, stay well, and stay connected.</p>

<p>The findings, published online May 7 in <em>Cell</em>, reveal early genetic distinctions between groups in nearby regions, population mixing within and beyond the Andes, surprising genetic continuity amid cultural upheaval, and ancestral cosmopolitanism among some of the region's most well-known ancient civilizations.</p>
<p>Led by researchers at Harvard Medical School and the University of California, Santa Cruz, the team analyzed genome-wide data from 89 individuals who lived between 500 and 9,000 years ago. Of these, 64 genomes, ranging from 500 to 4,500 years old, were newly sequenced&#8212;more than doubling the number of ancient individuals with genome-wide data from South America.</p>
<p>The analysis included representatives of iconic civilizations in the Andes from whom no genome-wide data had been reported before, including the Moche, Nasca, Wari, Tiwanaku and Inca.</p>
<p>"This was a fascinating and unique project," said Nathan Nakatsuka, first author of the paper and an MD/PhD student in the lab of David Reich in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS.</p>
<p>"It represents the first detailed study of Andean population history informed by pre-Colonial genomes with wide-ranging temporal and geographic coverage," said Lars Fehren-Schmitz, associate professor at UC Santa Cruz and co-senior author of the paper with Reich.</p>
<p>"This study also takes a major step toward redressing the global imbalance in ancient DNA data," said Reich, professor of genetics at HMS and associate member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.</p>
<p>"The great majority of published ancient DNA studies to date have focused on western Eurasia," he said. "This study in South America allows us to begin to discern at high resolution the detailed history of human movements in this extraordinarily important part of the world."</p>
<p><strong>Attention on the Andes</strong></p>
<p>The central Andes, surrounding present-day Peru, is one of the few places in the world where farming was invented rather than being adopted from elsewhere and where the earliest presence of complex civilizations in South America has been documented so far. While the region has been a major focus of archaeological research, there had been no systematic characterization with genome-wide ancient DNA until now, the authors said.</p>
<p>Geneticists, including several of the current team members, previously studied the deep genetic history of South America as a whole, including analysis of several individuals from the Andean highlands from many thousands of years ago. There have also been analyses of present-day residents of the Andes and a limited number of mitochondrial or Y-chromosome DNA analyses from individual ancient Andean sites.</p>
<p>The new study, however, expands on these findings to provide a far more comprehensive portrait. Now, Nakatsuka said, researchers are "finally able to see how the genetic structure of the Andes evolved over time."</p>
<p>By focusing on what is often called pre-Columbian history, the study demonstrates how large ancient DNA studies can reveal more about ancient cultures than studying present-day groups alone, said Reich.</p>
<p>"In the Andes, reconstruction of population history based on DNA analysis of present-day people has been challenging because there has so been much demographic change since contact with Europeans," Reich explained. "With ancient DNA data, we can carry out a detailed reconstruction of movements of people and how those relate to changes known from the archaeological record."</p>
<p><strong>'Extraordinary' ancient population structure</strong></p>
<p>The analyses revealed that by 9,000 years ago, groups living in the Andean highlands became genetically distinct from those that eventually came to live along the Pacific coast. The effects of this early differentiation are still seen today.</p>
<p>The genetic fingerprints distinguishing people living in the highlands from those in nearby regions are "remarkably ancient," said Nakatsuka, who will receive his PhD in systems, synthetic and quantitative biology in May.</p>
<p>"It is extraordinary, given the small geographic distance," added Reich.</p>
<p>By 5,800 years ago, the population of the north also developed distinct genetic signatures from populations that became prevalent in the south, the team found. Again, these differences can be observed today.</p>
<p>After that time, gene flow occurred among all regions in the Andes, although it dramatically slowed after 2,000 years ago, the team found.</p>
<p>"It is exciting that we were actually able to determine relatively fine-grained population structure in the Andes, allowing us to differentiate between coastal, northern, southern and highland groups as well as individuals living in the Titicaca Basin," said Fehren-Schmitz.</p>
<p>"This is significant for the archaeology of the Andes and will now allow us to ask more specific questions with regards to local demographies and cultural networks," said study co-author Jose Capriles of Pennsylvania State University.</p>
<p><strong>Genetic intermingling</strong></p>
<p>The team discovered genetic exchanges both within the Andes and between Andean and non-Andean populations.</p>
<p>Ancient people moved between south Peru and the Argentine plains and between the north Peru coast and the Amazon, largely bypassing the highlands, the researchers found.</p>
<p>Fehren-Schmitz was especially interested to uncover signs of long-range mobility in the Inca period. Specifically, he was surprised to detect ancient North Coast ancestry not only around Cusco, Peru, but also in a child sacrifice from the Argentinian southern Andes.</p>
<p>"This could be seen as genetic evidence for relocations of individuals under Inca rule, a practice we know of from ethnohistorical, historical and archaeological sources," he said.</p>
<p>Although the findings of genetic intermingling throughout the Andes correlate with known archaeological connections, they will likely prompt additional archaeological research to understand the cultural contexts underlying the migrations, said Nakatsuka.</p>
<p>"Now we have more evidence demonstrating important migrations and some constraints on when they happened, but further work needs to be done to know why exactly these migrations occurred," he said.</p>
<p><strong>Long-term continuity</strong></p>
<p>The analyses revealed that multiple regions maintained genetic continuity over the past 2,000 years despite clear cultural transformations.</p>
<p>The finding contrasts with many other world regions, where ancient DNA studies often document substantial genetic turnover during this period, said Reich.</p>
<p>The population structures that arose early on persisted through major social changes and on into modern societies, the authors said. The discoveries offer new evidence that can be incorporated alongside archaeological and other records to inform theories on the ancient history of different groups in the region.</p>
<p>"To our surprise, we observed strong genetic continuity during the rise and fall of many of the large-scale Andean cultures, such as the Moche, Wari and Nasca," said Nakatsuka. "Our results suggest that the fall of these cultures was not due to massive migration into the region, e.g., from an invading military force, a scenario which had been documented in some other regions of the world."</p>
<p>Two exceptions to the continuity trend were the vast urban centers that the Tiwanaku and Inca cultures called home. Rather than being fairly genetically homogeneous, the capital regions of these civilizations were cosmopolitan, hosting people from many genetic backgrounds, the team found.</p>
<p>"It was interesting to start to see these glimpses of ancestral heterogeneity," said Nakatsuka. "These regions have some similarity to what we see now in places like New York City and other major cities where people of very different ancestries are living side by side."</p>
<p><strong>Cooperative authorship</strong></p>
<p>The study included authors from many disciplines and many countries, including Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Chile, Germany, Peru, the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>"This is an impressive interdisciplinary but, just as importantly, international collaboration," said study co-author Bastien Llamas of the University of Adelaide. "All worked very closely to draft this manuscript under the leadership of Fehren-Schmitz and Reich."</p>
<p>It was important to team up with local scientists who belong to communities that descend from the individuals analyzed in the study, Fehren-Schmitz said, and to obtain permission from and continually engage with indigenous and other local groups as well as local governments.</p>
<p>The analysis of DNA from ancient individuals can have significant implications for present-day communities. One concerns the physical handling of the skeletal materials, which might be sensitive to the groups involved.</p>
<p>The work provided opportunities to heal past wounds. In one case, a sample from Cusco, previously housed in the U.S., was repatriated to Peru. Other remains that had long ago been taken improperly from burial sites were able to be carbon-dated and reburied.</p>
<p>In the absence of pre-Columbian written histories, archaeology has been the main source of information available to reconstruct the complex history of the continent, said study co-author Chiara Barbieri of the University of Zurich.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the study of ancient DNA, we can read the demographic history of ancient groups and understand how ancient and present-day groups are related,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The link with the genetic study of living populations opens a direct dialogue with the past and an occasion to involve local communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers sought to deeply involve communities with the help of archaeologists from each area, said Nakatsuka. Their efforts included giving public talks about the study and translating materials into Spanish.</p>
<p>"We were really happy to have the summary and key findings of our paper translated and included as part of the <em>Cell</em> paper itself, to increase accessibility of our work," said Nakatsuka. "We hope future studies will do similar translations, including versions suitable for lay audiences for schools, museum exhibits and cultural organizations, which we are in the process of doing as well."</p>

He was 67.</p>
<p>Stouras was born on January 7, 1953 in Likouria, Greece, a mountain village in the Peloponnese. His family had survived both the Nazi invasion of Greece and the Greek Civil War, and eventually emigrated to the United States when Stouras was a child. They settled in San Jose, where he began school, learned English, and became the elder brother to his sister Hilda and brother Tom. Stouras lost his mother at 16. Stouras earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in literature from UC Berkeley, and developed into a writer himself, using this skill in the career that followed. His professional endeavors included justice and advocacy work, writing and technical writing, and administrative positions. Professional engagements included work for the California School Employees Association, Nokia, and UCSC.</p>
<p>Stouras&#8217;s sister-in-law Hannah Pederson, a department manager for the Art Department, introduced him to working at UC Santa Cruz, the alma mater of his wife and stepson. Stouras first worked for the Environmental Studies Department, then Cowell College, and Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, all of which he truly enjoyed. Stouras said what he really valued were the relationships and interactions with colleagues and the students on the beautiful, forested campus. Stouras enjoyed people, and really enjoyed being helpful to others. He had also worked on the construction of the UCSC campus with his father in the early years of the university.</p>
<p>Stouras and his wife, Elisa Pederson Stouras (<span>Anthropology, 1993)</span>, were constant companions, best friends, and knew themselves to be &#8216;lucky and blessed&#8217; for the full, rich relationship they enjoyed. They loved the ordinariness of making a home and a life together, growing a garden and nurturing their children and grandchild. They loved most to be in the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada together, sharing in the piercing, harsh, freshness of the high country, penetrated by the silence and the indescribable beauty of the sacred places. They called the mountains their Cathedral.</p>
<p>Friends and family said Stouras was a poet and a lover of the sacred. He was a self-disciplined seeker with a mythopoetic imagination and a voracious intellect that stored great accumulations of knowledge in literature, film, theatre, music, poetry, art, the sciences, health, politics, religion, mythology, archetypal and Jungian psychology, Buddhism, meditation, and biodynamic gardening, which he studied at UCSC. He was an accomplished fencer, equestrian, runner, weight lifter, backpacker, cross country skier and expert baseball enthusiast. He loved to cook Greek foods. Olive oil, garlic, lemon and oregano were always involved. Stouras possessed a humor and wit that were sharp and at the ready, his levity gracing others with pleasure and laughter.</p>
<p>Stouras is survived by his wife, Elisa Pederson Stouras; his daughter, Gabriella Marie Stouras, and son, John Alec Stouras, stepson Zeya Nahadeh Schindler (<span>Literature, 2007)</span>, and grandson, Bodhi Goldfeld Schindler.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f14f180d8072701763b3cba664696ba5"><name>updated-sc-county-order-allows-more-businesses-to-open</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Updated Santa Cruz County order allows more businesses to open</title><summary>Santa Cruz County issued on May 6 an updated Shelter-in-Place Order allowing local businesses to conduct limited reopenings as Gov.

<p dir="ltr"><span>The U.S. Department of Education on Wednesday issued long-anticipated Title IX rules mandating how schools nationwide respond to complaints of sexual harassment. Schools, including UC Santa Cruz, have been given until Aug.14 to comply with these new regulations.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Both UC Santa Cruz and the UC system as a whole decry these poorly-conceived changes. We pledge to continue our work to create a campus free of sexual harassment and violence through education, prevention, and processes that are fair and compassionate to all parties.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Given the time frame for implementation, the systemwide Title IX Office and Student Affairs will establish a working group with diverse, systemwide representation to help us identify ways to comply with the rules while staying true to our values. We look forward to supporting these efforts. To that end, the UCSC Title IX Office will co-host a series of community sessions with </span><span>Campus Advocacy, Resources, and Education (CARE); Respondent Support Services; Dean of Students Office; CHES; Academic Personnel Office</span><span>; Staff HR; and other community partners to hear community concerns and gather information to help inform local and systemwide implementation </span><span>of these new regulations.

<p dir="ltr"><span>We are grateful for the courage of people who step forward to report their experiences and those who chose to participate in the investigation and adjudication process. Our campuses are safer because of their bravery. We want to stress that current investigations will not be affected by these new regulations, which do not go into effect until August 14.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>When the department first proposed updated regulations in 2018, the University of California expressed serious concerns about key aspects of the federal rules, as did students, survivors, advocates, Title IX professionals, and others across the nation. The proposed regulations garnered an unprecedented number of public comments including those gathered from UCSC community members at on-campus events organized by our students.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We were disappointed to see that, despite the unprecedented number of comments, the Department of Education largely disregarded the input it received, putting forth regulations mostly unchanged from the 2018 version. It is particularly disheartening that the federal government is seeking to impose these new rules, and enforcing a tight timeline for compliance, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, when students, staff, and faculty are dealing with upheavals to their daily lives and when schools have a very limited ability to meet in-person with community members to discuss these changes. </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-undeterred-despite-harmful-federal-sexual-harassment-rules-0&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1589038248970000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbCFtW5Ct_80aafCVOVFiYj8M9mw" href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-undeterred-despite-harmful-federal-sexual-harassment-rules-0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>President Janet Napolitano issued this statement</span></a><span> regarding the U.S. Department of Education&#8217;s announcement of final Title IX rules.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Suzanne Taylor, UC&#8217;s Systemwide Title IX Officer, said UC will support legal challenges to the rules, which may stop or delay their implementation. &#8220;UC&#8217;s imperative now is to respond to the rules thoughtfully and deliberately, with the security and well-being of our students and the broader community as our highest priorities.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Sexual misconduct has no place at UCSC or any UC campus. We remain committed to stewarding policy implementation that, in addition to being compliant, is consistent with our community values and the educational mission of the UC; that honors the risk and trust community members show every time they speak out or engage in our Title IX process; and centers the lived experiences of our students, staff, and faculty. We will continue to strive to do the least harm, to hold all community members in esteem, to hold each other accountable, to demonstrate commitment to due process, and to ensure fundamental fairness in our process.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We recognize the importance of campus partners like </span><span>CARE</span><span>; Respondent Support Services; UCSC Police; and creative Faculty Senate initiatives like Beyond Compliance to create learning and working environments that are inclusive and welcoming to all. These partnerships and collaborations are critical to realizing our vision for a UC community free from sexual harassment and violence. That begins with evidence-based primary prevention efforts including building a culture of consent, preventing incidents before they occur, and intervening early to minimize harm, in addition to formal investigation processes that may result in measures to remedy harm.&#160;</span></p>

<p>Hannah Miller, a registered nurse at Good Samaritan Hospital in San Jose, said she has only been working 12&#8211;16 hours a week instead of her usual 36 because the hospital census is so low right now. Miller&#8217;s home unit is typically full of patients who have just gotten hip and knee replacements done. Like most hospitals, Good Samaritan has canceled all elective procedures. In light of the COVID&#8211;19 pandemic, the surgical units, including hers, were closed in order to accommodate an anticipated surge of coronavirus patients. However, that surge has not yet come. In addition, people who would normally go to the emergency room are staying away because some have lost their jobs and don&#8217;t have health insurance, while others are afraid of catching COVID&#8211;19.</p>
<p>Fortunately, her hospital has implemented &#8220;pandemic pay&#8221; so she gets 70 percent of her usual salary for every dropped hour. &#8220;If I wasn&#8217;t getting that, I would be in a tricky position,&#8221; she said. Miller feels incredibly grateful to be receiving some financial support during this uncertain time, knowing that other nurses throughout the country have been furloughed and have had to collect unemployment.</p>
<p>Since her unit closed in March, Miller has been floated to other units as needed. She worked on the fifth floor, which was converted into one of the COVID&#8211;19 units, almost every shift for three weeks straight a month ago. She said there were between seven and 15 patients on the unit with capacity for 20 during that time.</p>
<p>The patients Miller cared for were mostly stable because those with more serious cases were sent to the intensive care unit. Many patients weren&#8217;t able to be discharged and stayed in the hospital longer than they needed to because they couldn&#8217;t take care of themselves at home, they had family at home they were worried about infecting, or they lived in a skilled nursing facility that wouldn&#8217;t take them back until they tested negative for COVID&#8211;19. This created a bottleneck effect that faster testing seemed to alleviate.</p>
<p>The patients in the COVID unit are very lonely as no visitors are allowed, Miller said. Some wanted to hear about her life, while others just wanted someone to talk to or to hold their hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The human aspect of nursing is something you don&#8217;t hear about often,&#8221; said Miller, who decided to pursue a career in nursing after discovering that nurses get to spend an entire shift caring for patients, while doctors typically only spend a few minutes with each patient.</p>
<p>Raised in Atlanta, but living in the Bay Area for more than a decade, she always knew she wanted to work in the medical field but wasn&#8217;t sure if she wanted to be a nurse or a physician. She settled on attending UC Santa Cruz and decided to take prerequisites for both pre-med and nursing while pursuing a bachelor&#8217;s degree in Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology.</p>
<p>A turning point came in her senior year when she became a pre-health adviser at the university&#8217;s career center. &#8220;That year was a huge eye opener for me to understand all the different paths in healthcare,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I had all the options at my fingertips.&#8221;</p>
<p>She decided nursing was the best fit because she wanted to focus on preventative care and health education. After graduating from UCSC in 2016, she was accepted into the Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing program at Samuel Merritt University in Oakland, a special nursing program designed for students that had already received a bachelor&#8217;s degree in another field. She graduated in 2018.</p>
<p>She is appreciative of how grateful people have been for nurses since the pandemic. Several local businesses have donated free meals for hospital staff, and there has been a lot of public support and appreciation from the community. &#8220;Since no visitors are allowed, I&#8217;ve been getting a lot of phone calls asking for updates on their loved ones. Family members are so thankful for our hard work and dedication,&#8221; said Miller, who feels that she is just doing the same job she&#8217;s always done&#8211;caring for patients when they are at their most vulnerable, despite the risks nurses face when working with patients that have infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Her work remains challenging as nothing in the hospital is predictable. &#8220;Every single day I am wondering what is the new change of the day,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;The constant changes regarding staffing, units opening and closing, and how we use/re-use (personal protective equipment) are keeping us on edge. But I know I&#8217;m lucky to work at a hospital that does have enough PPE for us because we are working hard to conserve it as much as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miller is pleased with how the state has reacted to the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re doing something right in California to be keeping our numbers so low,&#8221; said Miller. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been able to successfully flatten the curve by following the shelter in place guidelines, and I think if we keep up the good work and are careful about how we re-open everything, we&#8217;re going to be okay.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f68953ae8072701763b3cba63d9933e8"><name>citris-funding</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>CITRIS Seed Funding program invites proposals for pandemic and disaster preparedness projects</title><summary>CITRIS and the Banatao Institute at UC Santa Cruz is inviting UCSC researchers to apply for research support for projects focused on providing solutions to issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic and disaster preparedness.</summary><start-date>1588921200000</start-date><display-name>CITRIS Seed Funding program invites proposals for pandemic and disaster preparedness projects</display-name><path>/2020/05/citris-funding</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/05/citris-funding</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1588979127188</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1588982164930</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs Office</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioweb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/citris-ucsc-logo-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/citris-ucsc-logo-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>citris-ucsc-logo-450.jpg</name><display-name>citris-ucsc-logo-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>43937</file-size><width>450</width><height>123</height></image><image-alt>citris logo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/citris-ucsc-logo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/citris-ucsc-logo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>citris-ucsc-logo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>citris-ucsc-logo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23146</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>citris logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">CITRIS and the Banatao Institute at UC Santa Cruz is inviting UCSC researchers to apply for research support through its </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="https://citris.sites.ucsc.edu/ucsc-campus-seed-funding/"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Campus Seed Funding program</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">. For 2020, the program will fund projects focused on providing solutions to issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic and disaster preparedness.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The UC Santa Cruz Campus Seed Funding program, which is separate from the broader CITRIS Core Seed Funding initiative, focuses on strengthening interdisciplinary connections on the Santa Cruz campus. The program will fund early-stage research that furthers the CITRIS and the Banatao Institute mission and has strong promise of securing external funding.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The program ordinarily requires projects to include at least two principal investigators from different UC Santa Cruz campus divisions. While that is still strongly encouraged for 2020, projects with a single PI will be accepted this year in order to streamline the process and encourage responses in this unprecedented time.</span></p>

With the publication of their results May 12 in the </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4365/ab8868"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series</i></span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, Hausen and Robertson are also releasing the </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Morpheus</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> code publicly and providing online demonstrations.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The morphologies of galaxies, from rotating disk galaxies like our own Milky Way to amorphous elliptical and spheroidal galaxies, can tell astronomers about how galaxies form and evolve over time. Large-scale surveys, such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) to be conducted at the </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="https://www.lsst.org/"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Vera Rubin Observatory</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> now under construction in Chile, will generate huge amounts of image data, and Robertson has been involved in planning how to use that data to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies. LSST will take more than 800 panoramic images each night with a 3.2-billion-pixel camera, recording the entire visible sky twice each week.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Imagine if you went to astronomers and asked them to classify billions of objects&#8212;how could they possibly do that? Now we&#8217;ll be able to automatically classify those objects and use that information to learn about galaxy evolution,&#8221; Robertson said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Other astronomers have used deep-learning technology to classify galaxies, but previous efforts have typically involved adapting existing image recognition algorithms, and researchers have fed the algorithms curated images of galaxies to be classified. Hausen built </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Morpheus</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> from the ground up specifically for astronomical image data, and the model uses as input the original image data in the standard digital file format used by astronomers.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Pixel-level classification is another important advantage of </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Morpheus</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, Robertson said. &#8220;With other models, you have to know something is there and feed the model an image, and it classifies the entire galaxy at once,&#8221; he said. &#8220;</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Morpheus</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> discovers the galaxies for you, and does it pixel by pixel, so it can handle very complicated images, where you might have a spheroidal right next to a disk. For a disk with a central bulge, it classifies the bulge separately. So it&#8217;s very powerful.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">To train the deep-learning algorithm, the researchers used information from a 2015 study in which dozens of astronomers classified about 10,000 galaxies in Hubble Space Telescope images from the CANDELS survey. They then applied </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Morpheus</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> to image data from the </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/05/hubble-legacy-field.html"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Hubble Legacy Fields</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, which combines observations taken by several Hubble deep-field surveys. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">When </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Morpheus</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> processes an image of an area of the sky, it generates a new set of images of that part of the sky in which all objects are color-coded based on their morphology, separating astronomical objects from the background and identifying point sources (stars) and different types of galaxies. The output includes a confidence level for each classification. Running on UCSC&#8217;s </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/10/lux-supercomputer.html"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">lux supercomputer</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, the program rapidly generates a pixel-by-pixel analysis for the entire data set.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Morpheus</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> provides detection and morphological classification of astronomical objects at a level of granularity that doesn&#8217;t currently exist,&#8221; Hausen said.</span></p>

Priority will be given to course proposal submissions that address degree completion, have high enrollment, or are for types of courses (e.g., labs, studios) that have presented greater challenges in being offered remotely.</span><br/><br/><span>Faculty whose proposals are approved will be provided $4,000 in summer compensation</span><span size="1" style="font-size: xx-small;">(1)</span><span>, and pedagogical and technical support throughout the course design and development process. All instructional faculty are eligible to apply.</span><br/><span>&#160;</span><br/><span>A committee will review all course proposals, and awardees will be expected to submit a request for online course approval to the Senate Committee on Courses of Instruction (CCI). Courses are required to be available to students in an asynchronous mode, although they should include options for synchronous engagement via office hours, Google Doc collaborations, study groups, and other interaction. Faculty whose proposals are awarded agree to share their course materials with instructors of future offerings of the course.</span><br/><br/><span>Courses will be developed in cohorts of roughly ten faculty led by an instructional designer, supporting staff, and a faculty fellow. Each cohort will work together for six weeks. The first three weeks will be focused on course design, framed by a new UCSC course on designing and developing online courses. The cohort will meet twice weekly in what we expect will be a meaningful learning community. The second three-week period will be used for course production. Loaner equipment will be made available to awardees for recording lecture videos at home, or they will have limited access to filming in studios on campus. The first pair of cohorts will meet from June 15-July 24, and the second pair of cohorts will meet from July 27-September 4.</span><br/><br/><span>We are deeply appreciative of your ingenuity and effort in the transition to remote instruction, and we hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to participate in a structured process that will result in creating courses that further engage our students and support learning outcomes.</span><br/><br/><strong>Proposal Guidelines<br/></strong><span>In no more than two pages, provide responses to the following prompts:</span><br/>
<ol>
<li>Describe your course, including pertinent information such as its sequence in the curriculum, frequency of offerings, enrollment, typical assessments (e.g., papers, exams, quizzes, projects), and any challenges with offering it remotely.</li>
<li>Explain how a fully online version of your course would positively impact degree completion, have high enrollment, or would help transition a challenging type of course to a fully online format.</li>
<li>Discuss how an online version of your course may present an opportunity to improve student learning outcomes.</li>
<li>If you have a serious conflict with one of the cohort dates (June 15-July 24 or July 27-September 4), please give a brief explanation.</li>

The general principles and points of consideration articulated below are intended to inform faculty and researchers, department chairs, deans, research unit/center directors, and research leadership in their planning and decision-making.<br/><br/></div>
<div><strong>GENERAL PRINCIPLES<br/></strong>UCSC&#8217;s top priority is the health and safety of its faculty, staff, and students. Therefore,<span>&#160;</span><strong>UCSC will continue to comply with the current and future versions of the Governor&#8217;s Stay at Home Order, as well as County public health directives, especially physical (social) distancing requirements.</strong></div>
<div><br/>Because ramping up research will increase the population density in UCSC facilities at a time when Santa Cruz County shelter-in-place orders are relaxing, the opportunity for COVID-19 infections remains and the possibility of a resurgence exists.<span>&#160;</span><strong>Our research ramp-up plans must adhere to and exceed the physical distancing and other safety requirements established by public health authorities and must include the possibility of returning to a lower level of activity and population density as needed.</strong></div>
<div><br/><strong>Ramping up research will begin slowly and carefully in approximately 2-3 weeks, initially with research that<span>&#160;</span><u>must</u><span>&#160;</span>take place in UCSC facilities and cannot be carried out at home and at densities that, as much as possible, mitigate risk of COVID-19 transmission.<span>&#160;</span></strong>Over time and with an abundance of caution, UCSC will gradually increase activity and the population density of its research facilities. As a general guideline, researchers should continue to perform research from home to the greatest extent possible. We appreciate the importance of campus offices to many researchers and will begin considering office access for research purposes when the Governor announces a move to late Stage 2. If your research requires access to library content please see<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/remote-access&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1589326359287000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGmxPmTsAVTpcUR-t8i2StTTIaktw" href="https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/remote-access" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://guides.library.ucsc.<wbr/>edu/remote-access</a>.</div>
<div><br/><strong>As the campus continues to ramp up on-site operations, additional public health precautions will be implemented. The campus is developing the testing and health monitoring protocols that will be implemented.</strong><span>&#160;</span>These can include, but are not limited to: daily symptom monitoring, temperature checks, asymptomatic testing, contact tracing and antibody testing. Plans will be developed in coordination with the Office of the President and other UC campuses.</div>
<div><br/>All researchers, including students, academic researchers, and support staff (technical and administrative), will be transitioned back to work slowly, taking into account physical distancing and personal protective equipment requirements. As the campus continues to scale up research operations, many students, staff, faculty, and researchers may face difficult emotions around returning to work. If you have concerns about returning to work, please consult with your appropriate<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://shr.ucsc.edu/contact/locate_team.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1589326359287000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGmTel1OQSYcs0wQiZfTsha8krqUQ" href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/contact/locate_team.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Employee Relations analyst</a><span>&#160;</span>or<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apo.ucsc.edu/about/contacts/div-contacts/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1589326359287000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF5ZxfirvmhC1Er8iZ8Syau34CqxA" href="https://apo.ucsc.edu/about/contacts/div-contacts/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">academic personnel representative</a>.

<div><br/>Early-stage researchers, including graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, are in a particularly critical time in their academic and professional careers. Therefore, to the extent possible,<span>&#160;</span><strong>ramp-up plans should prioritize getting these scholars back on track as soon as possible, and processes for granting access should be fair and transparent.</strong></div>
<div><br/><strong>PLANNING PROCESS FOR ENABLING THE RESEARCH RAMP-UP</strong><br/><br/></div>
<div>The planning process will proceed as follows, with the above general principles guiding plan development and consideration given to the points further below.<br/><br/></div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>The official (e.g., Dean, Director) responsible for each building will develop an occupancy plan for each building/facility in which research is conducted, keeping in mind existing use by faculty teaching online courses and others approved via the exception process. Where building/facility oversight is shared, responsible officials should collaborate. While plans may differ between buildings/facilities, all plans should address:
<ol>
<li>Managing population density and accommodating physical distancing;</li>
<li>Adherence to UCSC health and safety guidelines; and</li>
<li>A process&#8212;probably via a committee&#8212;for reviewing and approving the ramp-up plans for independent labs and research programs housed in the building/facility.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Faculty members and researchers with independent laboratories/studios and research programs will develop plans for their space. These plans should be based on target densities and social distancing requirements (both of which will be provided), bearing in mind the dynamic nature of lab/studio activities and the use of common equipment in labs and studios, and include plans for disinfecting high-touch surfaces, and maintaining appropriate laboratory safety. (See<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/covid-19/research-ramp-up.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1589326359287000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHni-_yBQL2NnK-q5FKll6Wc8INIw" href="https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/covid-19/research-ramp-up.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://officeofresearch.ucsc.<wbr/>edu/covid-19/research-ramp-up.<wbr/>html</a><span>&#160;</span>for planning templates and web forms for submittal, a Research Ramp-up Checklist, and COVID-19 Disinfection Guidance.)</li>
<li>The official(s) responsible (or their designated committee) for the buildings/facilities that house research space will review and approve plans deemed feasible within their building/facility occupancy plan. Approved plans will be forwarded by the Responsible Official(s) to the Office of Research (OR) for final review with Support Services/Facilities to ensure appropriate levels of operations support for the planned activities. Once approved by OR, the individual ramp-up plans may commence.</li>
<li>The Office of Research will communicate with the responsible officials as needed to inform them of any changes to the operational restrictions, such as target densities. They will use that information to determine which plans they may approve and at what level.&#160;</li>
</ol>
<strong>Initial Target Densities for labs/studios</strong>: Initial target densities will be 500-1000 sq. ft. per person. In smaller spaces, this means one person per room. In larger spaces, the specific amount of space allocated per person should depend upon the configuration and use of the space. For example, in the large shared labs in Biomed, we anticipate no more than 1 person per bay, with provisions to avoid 2 people in adjacent bays using benches that face each other.<br/><br/></div>
<div><strong>Initial Target Densities for buildings</strong><span>&#160;</span>will be determined in consultation with Support Services/Facilities and communicated to the official(s) responsible for each building.</div>
<div><br/><strong>Building/facility occupancy plans and individual research ramp-up plans should be considered living documents.</strong><span>&#160;</span>As such, the owners of these plans are responsible for monitoring communications from the Office of Research regarding changes state and county public health orders, UCSC health and safety requirements, as well as any other applicable health and safety directives, and modifying their plans accordingly.<br/><br/></div>
<div><strong>POINTS OF CONSIDERATION</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Faculty, independent researchers, department chair, deans and research unit directors should carefully consider the spirit of these guidelines, and always make the health and safety of the research workforce their primary concern.</li>
<li>Everyone accessing the campus and facilities will need to abide by the campus and public health directives already in place, including requirements for face coverings and building signage. Failure to align with the requirements could result in denial of access.</li>
<li>Employees who are at<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1589326359287000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG-BrMxYJSdMRU9_k1gWxv7AkELEw" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">higher risk for severe illness due to COVID-19</a><span>&#160;</span>should not hesitate to reach out to discuss potential reasonable accommodations so that we can collectively prioritize everyone&#8217;s health and safety.</li>
<li>Ramping up research will increase the current population density in buildings, especially in elevators, stairwells, hallways, restrooms, and other shared spaces where physical distancing and sanitation of high-touch surfaces will be more challenging. Therefore, it is important that plans consider the overall population density of buildings (in addition to individual research spaces) by limiting personnel to the number that a workspace can safely accommodate while meeting or exceeding physical distancing requirements at all times. In larger rooms and shared spaces, this will mean more than one person, which will require coordinating with other space users. If space constraints (of any type) or the use of shared equipment prevent physical distancing and/or following other public health requirements, the space must remain single-use until circumstances change to enable safe sharing.</li>
<li>To the maximum extent possible:
<ul>
<li>Doors should be designated exclusively for entrance or exit.</li>
<li>Staircases should be designated as up or down only.</li>
<li>Corridors should be designated as one way.</li>
<li>Scheduling time in the research space should be accomplished in a fair and equitable manner; however, consider giving priority to trainees (graduate students and postdocs) who need to meet academic deadlines and junior faculty who are establishing their careers.</li>
<li>Minimize situations where two or more people must work together, and where this cannot be avoided (complex experiments, training experiences or where lab safety requires working with a buddy) research personnel should follow public health directives and physical distancing requirements to the greatest extent possible (except in emergencies).</li>
<li>Experiments that require access to equipment in another laboratory should be coordinated ahead of time.</li>
<li>One-to-one discussions should occur virtually, except when truly necessary for conducting research or maintaining lab safety.</li>
<li>Use shared calendars to schedule research team lab time and use shift work (staggered work schedules) to maintain low population density. Plan on collaborating with other lab leaders to create a calendar for shared lab space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All group meetings should continue to be held virtually.</li>
<li>Face coverings continue to be required when working in or walking through common areas such as hallways, stairways, elevators, restrooms, and parking facilities, or in any room or enclosed area when other people are present.</li>
<li>Consider how communications will occur within and between research teams, and ensure redundant responsibility for team communications. Plan on communicating frequently and openly with team members (and neighbors in shared space) regarding scheduling.</li>
<li>Team members should weigh the need for coming to campus against potential health and safety hazards (to themselves and others). This includes avoiding coming to campus whenever showing any symptoms of potential illness.</li>
<li>To the greatest extent possible, desktop activities should be conducted at home. Where such desktop research cannot be conducted remotely, researchers should work with deans, department chairs, or directors to develop plans for staggered occupancy days/times to reduce density in shared spaces. This applies to researchers who primarily work in individual offices occupied by one person, where such research cannot be conducted remotely, or where there is a need for access to collections (archives, books, artifacts, creative works).</li>
<li>Assume that undergraduate student involvement in research will be limited to those highly exceptional situations where they are essential personnel (by their choosing, and not mandated by a PI).</li>
<li>Only UCSC employees and registered students (if they have chosen to participate in research) may conduct research&#8212;volunteers and visitors should not conduct research or be in UCSC research space at this time.</li>
<li>Consider the needs of employees/students with current disability accommodations or those who will require new accommodations and work with the applicable HR or academic personnel representative as accommodation requests are received.</li>
<li>DO NOT ramp-up research without first ensuring/acquiring adequate stocks of PPE and research supplies to carry out planned experiments. Consider the current state of supply chains and plan appropriately.</li>
<li>Be prepared to use PPE or other precautionary measures (such as cloth masks) to meet physical distancing requirements.</li>
<li>Make sure that core facilities will be operating before ramping up research that relies on their services. Be sure to schedule research activities to coincide with their days and hours of operation.</li>
<li>Do not ramp-up research that generates large volumes of hazardous waste and/or necessarily involves chemical, biological, radiation or other hazards without first consulting with EH&amp;S to review lab safety and assess waste disposal requirements.</li>
<li>Consider how high-touch surfaces, such as bench tops, equipment, door handles, keyboards, etc. will be sanitized prior to ramping up research and how this will be sustained over time. In addition, consider what hygiene procedures personnel should conduct when they arrive in the lab, especially if they rely on public transportation or transportation that they don&#8217;t personally own when commuting to campus.</li>
<li>Use the Research Ramp-up Check List in the planning and ramp-up processes.</li>
<li><strong>All research leaders are responsible for what happens in their space, including their team&#8217;s compliance with these guidelines.</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>By developing appropriately careful plans for ramping up research now, UCSC will continue to &#8220;flatten the curve&#8221; while also preparing to responsibly resume our research mission as safely and effectively as possible.</div>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Affirm healthy norms</span><span>--virtually or in-person--by practicing respect and kindness, defining and expressing personal boundaries, supporting others by valuing and upholding their personal boundaries, and checking in with your community.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Engage in intervention </span><span>even during physical distancing. We can intervene on social media, video calls, texts, as well as in person. Check-in calls via video and phone may be ways to buffer against violence at home.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Express support privately</span><span> if you are concerned about someone experiencing abuse or violence. Check in with them, offer resources, and identify additional opportunities for intervention.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Finally, I want to send a deep, heartfelt thank you to the campus and community sexual and domestic violence response providers as well as the healthcare providers, first-responders, and essential personnel who are maintaining critical campus functions.&#160;</span></p>

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The interdisciplinary projects cover many aspects of the pandemic&#8217;s impact, from testing, treatment, and transmission to genomics and virology, policy and privacy. Projects were funded at an average of $50,000 each, and selected with an eye towards cost, scalability, and impact. All are centered in one of four CITRIS-affiliated UC campuses: UC Berkeley, UC Davis (including UC Davis Health), UC Merced, and UC Santa Cruz. Projects are designed to show research results within three to six months.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Among the awards are the following projects based at UC Santa Cruz:</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><strong>Video-Assisted Clinical Care for Remote Management of COVID-19</strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Led by Narges Norouzi, professor of computer science and engineering at UC Santa Cruz, and Ian Julie at UC Davis, this project will demonstrate real-time analysis of video and the ability to identify clinically useful information from a live video stream to assist clinicians in the management of COVID-19 patients. The proposal includes implementation and validation of a mobile application that augments the video stream with patient information such as blood oxygen saturation level, respiratory rate, and heart rate in real-time. The researchers also plan to analyze respiration patterns and oxygen saturation levels of COVID-19 patients and build a predictive model to distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory and flu-like illnesses.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><strong>The UCSC SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser</strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Led by</span><span> Maximilian Haeussler </span><span>and</span><span> Jim Kent </span><span>at the</span><span> <a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz </a></span><a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/"><span>Genomics Institute</span></a>, the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/02/coronavirus-genome.html">coronavirus genome browser project</a> will accelerate successful COVID-19 research by integrating into the UCSC Genome Browser all genetic information from existing resources related to SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Cross-referenced and easily accessible molecular-level data of many types is essential for research, but traditional government genetic databases are fragmented and relatively slow to update. The SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser will convert, cross-reference, and make searchable molecular-level data of all types as it appears in databases and data supplements of publications, allowing users to check these against new mutations in the virus as they appear.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><strong>Creating</strong><strong> a diagnostic testing facility from a research lab</strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">A team of UCSC faculty led by Olena Vaske, assistant professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, has established the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/04/coronavirus-testing.html">UCSC Molecular Diagnostic Lab</a> to perform diagnostic testing for coronavirus infections. The CLIA-certified testing facility began operating on May 1 and is currently providing coronavirus tests for the UCSC Student Health Center and Santa Cruz Community Health. With support from research staff, graduate students, software engineers, and data analysts, the team achieved a rapid progression to automation of sample processing, clinical data management, and data security for large amounts of personal data to ensure HIPAA compliance.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">See the full list of 25 projects <a href="https://citris-uc.org/citris-seed-funding-covid-19-response-awarded-projects/">here</a>.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Within days of the application deadline, a $1.6 million matching challenge from an anonymous donor expanded potential funding exponentially, increasing the number of projects that can be funded.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This amazing response from the research community and our generous donor will greatly accelerate the innovation, ingenuity, and public service of the University of California,&#8221; said CITRIS Director Costas Spanos, a UC Berkeley faculty member in electrical engineering and computer science. &#8220;We are immensely grateful and welcome additional partners to further expand our efforts to address the pandemic.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We are all united in the vision that innovation can steer us not back to where we were, but to a stronger, more resilient health care system going forward,&#8221; said CITRIS Health Faculty Director Tom Nesbitt, senior advisor to UC Davis Health executive leadership and co-director of the Healthy Aging in a Digital World Initiative. Nesbitt is also a member of the University of California COVID-19 Task Force.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In addition to offering seed funding, CITRIS and the Banatao Institute has also undertaken other efforts to address the pandemic through its research thrusts and labs, from mobilizing CITRIS Health&#8217;s international networks to get PPE into the hands of U.S. clinicians to fabricating ventilator adaptors in the CITRIS Invention Lab to convert consumer-grade sleep apnea devices for clinical use. Throughout its 20-year history, CITRIS has developed technology solutions to respond to disasters &#8212; including earthquakes, wildfires, and floods &#8212; building resilience in California and beyond.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the Banatao Institute drive interdisciplinary innovation for social good with faculty, researchers, and students from four University of California campuses &#8211; Berkeley, Davis, Merced, and Santa Cruz &#8211; along with public and private partners.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/covid-19/</url><title>More COVID-19 News</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1031d1578072701763b3cba69219ad0e"><name>nanosensor</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>COVID Catalyst Fund supports work on rapid serology test at UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>Biomolecular engineer Nader Pourmand is evaluating the use of a novel nanosensor to provide rapid, low-cost, and accurate serology tests for coronavirus antibodies.</summary><keywords>Nader Pourmand</keywords><start-date>1589439600000</start-date><display-name>COVID Catalyst Fund supports work on rapid serology test at UC Santa Cruz</display-name><path>/2020/05/nanosensor</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/05/nanosensor</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1589409599800</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1590092496117</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19</value><value>Human Health</value><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/nader-pourmand-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/nader-pourmand-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nader-pourmand-350.jpg</name><display-name>nader-pourmand-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>69696</file-size><width>350</width><height>399</height></image><image-alt>Nader Pourmand</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/nader-pourmand-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/nader-pourmand-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nader-pourmand-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>nader-pourmand-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22298</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Nader Pourmand</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Nader Pourmand</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Biomolecular engineer Nader Pourmand is evaluating the use of a novel nanosensor to provide rapid, low-cost, and accurate serology tests for coronavirus antibodies</article-subhead><article-text><p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Researchers at UC Santa Cruz are testing a novel nanosensor technology that could provide rapid, low-cost serology tests with high sensitivity for detecting and quantifying antibodies to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The detection of antibodies to the virus in a blood sample indicates that a person has been infected and developed an immune response. Whereas diagnostic tests for the virus itself identify active infections, serology tests can identify people who have already been infected and have presumably developed some level of immunity (although many uncertainties remain about immunity to the novel coronavirus). Serology tests are important for quantifying the actual number of cases of COVID-19 that have occurred, including asymptomatic cases and those who have recovered.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Nader Pourmand, professor of biomolecular engineering in the </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Baskin School of Engineering</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> at UC Santa Cruz, is evaluating a serology testing platform derived from nanopipette technology developed in his lab. He has received a $75,000 grant from the </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="http://cend.globalhealth.berkeley.edu/covid-catalyst-rapid-funding-accelerate-covid-19-research/"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">COVID Catalyst fund</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> established at UC Berkeley to provide rapid funding for COVID-19 research at the institutions within the </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="http://cend.globalhealth.berkeley.edu/bay-area-virus-network-2/"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Bay Area Virus Network</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">An important part of this is not only the funding, but also having access to serology samples from UCSF for evaluating our technology,&#8221; Pourmand said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Two main types of COVID-19 serology tests are currently available&#8212;laboratory tests that can quantify the level of antibodies in the blood (using a technique called ELISA), and rapid tests that indicate the presence or absence of antibodies and use a small, portable platform (called lateral flow assays). Reports of inaccurate results from some of the rapid tests on the market have raised questions about how useful they are. In addition, the rapid tests do not measure the level of antibodies, which is valuable information for evaluating immune responses, identifying potential plasma donors, and tracking disease progression, Pourmand said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Novel technology</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The new nanosensor technology offers the potential to rapidly detect and quantify antibodies to the coronavirus in a finger-prick blood sample in less than a minute, using disposable cartridges and a relatively inexpensive ($100) reader that could be available at pharmacies, clinics, and other points of care. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The cartridges use nanosensor chips designed by Pinpoint Science, which has licensed from UCSC several patents for Pourmand&#8217;s nanopipette technology. (Pourmand is chief scientist of Pinpoint Science.) Pourmand&#8217;s lab originally developed the nanopipette technology for nondestructive, single-cell analysis of living cells, but the glass nanopipettes are impractical for large-scale manufacturing. Pinpoint Science developed a four-channel nanosensor chip which is fabricated by the semiconductor company Analog Devices.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">At the tip of each channel is a tiny pore, and the device measures the electric current through the pore. Viral antigens are immobilized on the nanosensor tip, and when the targeted antibodies bind to the antigen probes, a change in the current indicates the concentration of the target. This provides a very precise measure of the level of Covid-19 antibodies in a specimen. Pinpoint's initial testing of the nanosensor chips has shown target detection at levels as low as 1 femtogram per milliliter, or roughly 100,000 times more sensitive than conventional immunoassays, Pourmand said.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Hundreds of molecules can bind to the opening of the pore, and the change in current gives an indication of how many molecules there are,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our sensors are very sensitive, more sensitive than other technologies, and it&#8217;s a small system that&#8217;s easy to use and gives results in seconds.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Pourmand&#8217;s lab is currently testing the chips and optimizing the conjugation of the antigen probes to the nanosensor tips. Then they will test the system using real blood samples and compare its performance with current technologies.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">While Pourmand&#8217;s lab at UCSC focuses on evaluating the nanosensor technology for antibody testing, Pinpoint Science is evaluating its use for detecting viral antigens as a rapid diagnostic test for active infections. For this approach, the target and the probe are flipped, with antibodies immobilized on the nanosensor tip and viral antigens detected and quantified when they bind to the antibody probes.</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s first college started out as a bold experiment to transform higher education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following in the footsteps of Oxford and Cambridge colleges, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s founding provost, Page Smith, seized the opportunity to reform teaching and learning in the UC system.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he established Cowell College, the first residential college on the UCSC campus, Smith was reacting against an educational system he considered passive and uninspiring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Named after the Henry Cowell family&#8212;namesake of the Cowell Foundation, which was willing to donate back a good chunk of the $2 million price tag for the land that was once home to Cowell Ranch&#8212;Cowell College was the first of 10 residential colleges created to provide a more inclusive and supportive learning environment for students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, it hasn&#8217;t lost its core values of collective inquiry and community. That legacy is best summarized into the college&#8217;s motto: &#8220;The pursuit of truth in the company of friends.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s the lifelong learning commitment to knowledge through collaboration with others and relationship building,&#8221; said Alan Christy, provost of Cowell College and associate professor of history.</span></p>
<p><strong>A rich history</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowell College is full of landmarks and gathering places that foster a sense of community. Students can study or hold meetings at the intimate and inviting Page Smith Library, which dates back to the construction of Cowell College.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Page Smith Library is almost like walking through a time capsule,&#8221; said Seymour Hendrik (Cowell &#8216;20, history), Cowell senator and Student Union Assembly member. &#8220;Things are quite pristine and look very similar to the original images posted on the walls in the library.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s no wonder that this library is also a popular meeting spot during UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Alumni Weekend festivities. Acclaimed historian Patricia Nelson Limerick (Cowell &#8216;72, American studies) drew a standing-room-only crowd to the library last year when she talked about the power of improvisation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story of one of Cowell's most unique features&#8212;the Cowell Press&#8212;began in the late &#8216;60s when a former student found a vintage handworking letterpress and brought it to the Cowell campus. What started off as an enjoyable project turned into an established press and spin-off class for students hoping to explore this painstaking craft. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cowell Press workshop began with one vintage Chandler and Price platen press, but now includes three vintage Vandercook cylinder presses and two small Pilot presses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary Young, literature lecturer, award-winning poet, and Cowell Press director, teaches the press courses, covering topics on letterpress printing, book binding, printmaking, and typography. He also lets his students explore literary and visual design projects.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a class for students to be artists,&#8221; Young said, noting that he only admits one art major into these printing classes in order to encourage students from other disciplines to grow creatively. &#8220;Students get the chance to use their hands, manipulate materials, set type, and express themselves in artistic ways.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The college even has its own cafe culture. Cowell Coffee Shop has been a popular hub since it&#8217;s opening, but in recent times it has expanded its scope and mission to help students in need. It has transformed into a basic-needs cafe, becoming one of several food pantries on the UCSC campus that offers free food to UC Santa Cruz students, aiding the efforts to minimize food insecurity in the campus community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>The Cowell way of life</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Cowell College, learning is part of a social process. Student government, meeting hubs, and a strong spirit of mutual aid promote a robust atmosphere of learning in and out of the classroom.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Cowell student body is a close-knit community that is very supportive of one another. They are serious about their work but always willing to lend a helping hand,&#8221; said Young.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visitors to Cowell College will often come across gatherings of students in the Cowell Courtyard, just a few steps away from the East Field recreational complex, with sweeping views of the Monterey Bay peninsula. Students enjoy lounging in the quads and on the grassy knolls, where they build friendships and discuss their studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cowell is an open, inclusive space. No matter where you go, there are always people welcoming you and interested in getting to know you better,&#8221; said</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">student Hendrik.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowell Student Senate, the governing board at the college, has two primary goals: to ensure inclusion and to distribute funding to Cowell-related programs and events.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate invites students to take part in their campus community and learn about the different programs and initiatives that support and foster academic and social growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from overseeing the funding of events, Cowell Senate also supports campus-wide initiatives.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Senate acts as a platform to promote growth in the campus community, from getting more diverse voices represented in organizations to implementing sustainable practices,&#8221; said Cowell Senator Edie Trautwein (Cowell &#8216;22, film and digital media with a history of consciousness minor).</span></p>
<p><strong>Continuing a legacy through newly-acquired initiatives</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Center for Public Philosophy recently transitioned to the Cowell campus from the Humanities Institute. The center is a place for students to &#8220;engage in respectful and mutually beneficial discourse, including difficult topics,&#8221; said Christy. The center holds events, supports student research, and provides programs that involve philosophy and ethics.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One event in particular is the popular Ethics Bowl. The Ethics Bowl differs from the standard debate format because the two competing teams get to choose their stances on issues they believe in, and then make their case through valid reasoning and collaboration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Center for Public Philosophy site states, &#8220;The Ethics Bowl is less about persuasion and rhetoric, and more about truth, inquiry, and intellectual honesty.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>An inclusive space for all</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowell College has always prided itself on its spirit of inclusion and community support, and the Smith Society exemplifies those values. Based on the Cowell campus, the Smith Society, established over 20 years ago by Bill Dickinson (Cowell &#8216;68, philosophy), provides a sense of belonging, academic support, and financial assistance to UC Santa Cruz students lacking family guidance, including current and former foster youth and victims of child neglect or abuse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These students enter UCSC having to adapt to the rigors of college life without the traditional family support that many of their peers have. The Smith Society provides scholarships, in addition to faculty and community mentorships, research opportunities, and academic advising.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Imagining Justice: Past and Present</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowell's large population of Social Science majors </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a keen interest in Cowell&#8217;s core course class, which explores the concept of justice and its relation to punishment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally a two-year sequence, the core course, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagining Justice: Past and Present, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">has been streamlined since the early days of Cowell; these days, it lasts for one academic quarter. The course curriculum takes a deep dive into the themes of philosophy, ethics, and the justice system and analyzes the basis of rights across different societies and cultures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it&#8217;s the founding history, student engagement, prime location, or core course curriculum that draws students into Cowell College, one thing is certain: by the time they leave Cowell, their mindset of lifelong learning never dissipates.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are not just a place where students have their first-year course, live, and eat at the dining hall; we are a place that instills community,&#8221; said Christy. &#8220;Community building is a key component of the overall experience.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="150900678072701763b3cba6ba072f86"><name>akhtar-post</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Washington Post's depictions of autism shift from "cause and cure" to acceptance, study finds</title><summary>The Washington Post's depiction of autism has shifted over the years from a focus on "cause and cure" toward one of acceptance and accommodation, say the authors of a new study.</summary><keywords>autism, media, newspapers, disability, washington post</keywords><start-date>1589439600000</start-date><display-name>Akhtar-Washington Post</display-name><path>/2020/05/akhtar-post</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/05/akhtar-post</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1589490810954</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1589492058989</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/lewin_350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/lewin_350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lewin_350.jpg</name><display-name>lewin_350.jpg</display-name><file-size>45888</file-size><width>350</width><height>370</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Noa Lewin</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/lewin_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/lewin_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lewin_80.jpg</name><display-name>lewin_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>4202</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Noa Lewin</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>"The <em>Post</em>&#8217;s coverage reflected a widespread belief that having a disability is okay if you&#8217;re able to fit into a neurotypical world or if it offers a special talent or skill with social value, like being really good with computers," said Noa Lewin (Kresge College, '18, psychology and sociology), whose undergraduate senior thesis was the basis of the study.

(Photo by Melinda Sherwood)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Study reviews 315 articles published from 2007 to 2017 </article-subhead><article-text><p>The <em>Washington Post</em>'s depiction of autism has shifted over the years from a focus on "cause and cure" toward one of acceptance and accommodation, say the authors of a study that examined 315 articles published from 2007 to 2017.</p>
<p>The findings, which appear in the current online edition of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/cdso20/current"><em>Disability and Society</em></a>, suggest that media representations are changing to reflect new public attitudes generated in part by the autistic rights movement, say co-authors Noa Lewin, a 2018 graduate of UC Santa Cruz, and Nameera Akhtar, a professor of psychology at UCSC.</p>
<p>"There's less focus on cause and a bigger focus on accommodation," said Lewin (Kresge College, '18, psychology and sociology), whose undergraduate senior thesis was the basis of the study. "Coverage has shifted more toward how to make life better for autistic people and less on what is causing autism."</p>
<p>The paper, "<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09687599.2020.1751073">Neurodiversity and Deficit Perspectives in the<em> Washington Post</em>'s Coverage of Autism</a>," is based on a content analysis of coverage beginning in 2007, before the putative link between the MMR vaccine and autism had been completely debunked. It ends 10 years later, when the neurodiversity rights movement had advanced understanding and awareness about the range of ways brains function and that variations from "normal" are not necessarily deficits. The researchers chose to examine the influential <em>Washington Post </em>because it is widely read by legislators and policy makers.&#160;</p>
<p>Akhtar, the corresponding author of the paper, is at the forefront of <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/06/akhtar-autism.html">paradigm-shifting scholarship about autism</a> and has called for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/opinion/autism-social-life-new-research.html">greater understanding</a> of autism. "The autism self-advocacy movement has been around for a while, but the idea that autism is something that should be accommodated rather than &#8216;cured&#8217; is new for people who haven't been exposed to it," she said.&#160;</p>
<p>In their analysis, Lewin and Akhtar found that the <em>Post</em>'s articles over time were more likely to talk about "neurodiversity" and to acknowledge the strengths of autistic people. Articles also began to describe accommodations for autistic people, and a few began to feature the voices of autistic people themselves&#8212;a trend Lewin, who is autistic, particularly appreciated.</p>
<p>"I remember one article about autism-related legislation that quoted a member of the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN)," said Lewin, who links the increased visibility of people with autism to the broader disability-rights movement. "We tend to think of a disability as a medical tragedy, and we don't think about how attitudes, systemic ableism, and barriers contribute to that."</p>
<p>Although the paper&#8217;s coverage over time gradually placed more emphasis on autistic skills and strengths, coverage continued to use negative terms to describe autistic people. For example, the terms "high functioning" and "low functioning" continue to appear, despite autistic advocates' preference for more specific language, such as "speaking" and "non-speaking." And the emphasis on strengths was on autistic people who can do things like speak conversationally and hold jobs.&#160;</p>
<p>"The <em>Post</em>&#8217;s coverage reflected a widespread belief that having a disability is okay if you&#8217;re able to fit into a neurotypical world or if it offers a special talent or skill with social value, like being really good with computers," said Lewin.&#160;</p>
<p>Akhtar is pleased to see media representations of autism changing, and she was delighted to collaborate with Lewin on the paper. "Autistic people should be involved in research about autism," she said. "I was happy to work with Noa and to gain this insider's perspective. I learned a lot. You learn to broaden your way of thinking by interacting with people with different experiences."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1a6113668072701763b3cba6d655674b"><name>neurons</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Tracing neurons in the visual cortex sheds light on brain’s circuitry</title><summary>Researchers used a combination of techniques to identify different neuronal cell types and trace their connectivity within the mouse visual cortex.</summary><keywords>Euiseok Kim</keywords><start-date>1589785200000</start-date><display-name>Tracing neurons in the visual cortex sheds light on brain’s circuitry</display-name><path>/2020/05/neurons</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/05/neurons</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1589580469066</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1589812958011</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/neurons-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/neurons-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>neurons-400.jpg</name><display-name>neurons-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>123308</file-size><width>400</width><height>560</height></image><image-alt>microscope images of neurons and blood vessels in brain</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/neurons-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/neurons-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>neurons-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>neurons-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17921</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>neurons labeled green</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Researchers used light sheet microscopy and synaptic tracing with modified rabies virus to reconstruct the connectivity of neurons in the mouse visual cortex.

Genomic tools have been used to classify neuronal cell types according to their gene expression profiles, but a new study shows that gene expression alone cannot identify all of the different types of neurons.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Gene expression analysis is not sufficient to define the cell types. Using anatomical methods, we find cell types that are functionally very different within the same genomic cluster,&#8221; said Euiseok Kim, assistant professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz and first author of the study, </span><a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30310-X"><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">published May 11 in </span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Neuron</i></span></u></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The study focused on neurons that form connections between different visual areas of the cortex in mice. Neurons called cortico-cortical projection neurons relay signals from the primary visual cortex to higher visual areas that play different roles in the processing of visual information. In addition to these &#8220;feed-forward&#8221; signals, there are also feedback signals from the higher visual areas to the primary visual cortex. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Within the mouse visual cortices, there are at least ten different areas with different functions, and these areas need to talk to each other to produce the final visual perception,&#8221; Kim explained. &#8220;We don&#8217;t fully understand how they connect to each other, though, because the neurons are so intermingled in the brain that their connectivity is hidden. Only cellular-level dissection can help us see the connections.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Neuroscientists have developed techniques to trace neural connections using modified viruses, such as an attenuated strain of the rabies virus engineered to infect a specific population of neurons and express a green fluorescent protein. The virus is able to spread across the synapse where one neuron connects to another only once, revealing the direct connections.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">When we examine the brain, we can then see the connected network,&#8221; Kim said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">This technique enabled Kim to show that neurons that project from the primary visual cortex to different higher cortical areas differ systematically in their gene expression patterns, even though gene expression analysis alone identifies them as the same genetic type. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Another important finding is that these neurons receive feedback preferentially from the same areas to which they project. This was not unexpected, but it had not been confirmed prior to this study. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">It shows reciprocal connectivity, which is important for understanding the functional role of cortical feedback circuits,&#8221; Kim said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Kim conducted the study with colleagues at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, where he was a postdoctoral researcher prior to joining the faculty at UC Santa Cruz. This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the Brain Research Foundation.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2870afd88072701763b3cba656e1585f"><name>uc-sustainable-practices-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Systemwide review of revised UC Sustainable Practices Policy</title><summary>The University of California Office of the President invites comments on the proposed revisions to the UC Sustainable Practices policy.&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated 7.5 million small businesses in the United States face extinction because of the COVID-19 crisis that has forced them to shutter their operations. Many have minimal websites and e-commerce capabilities, or none at all, making it difficult to transition to online operations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But UC Santa Cruz students are hoping to keep local Santa Cruz businesses from that grim fate. They're part of a unique nonprofit program called GetVirtual, which doubles as an online entrepreneurship course and a nonprofit consulting firm pairing students with local businesses that were thriving before the virus hit, but are now struggling to make the transition from foot-traffic to online orders and sales.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 10 students function as interns for 15 area businesses, working closely with store owners to help them conduct their sales, operations, and marketing virtually. Demand for their services is high, with more than 50 businesses seeking help from GetVirtual. The program&#8217;s scope has been expanding, with GetVirtual partnerships starting at CSU Monterey Bay and Stanford University.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GetVirtual founder Toby Corey, an entrepreneur, Stanford lecturer, and former executive of Tesla, serves as a guiding voice and a high-profile mentor with strong industry connections. He envisioned GetVirtual.org as a nonprofit community partnership connecting local industry experts and mentors with UC Santa Cruz students, with help from the city of Santa Cruz&#8217;s economic development program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students take an intensive course taught via Zoom by lecturer, broadcaster, and multimedia artist Nada Miljkovi&#263;, who quickly recruited undergrads for the course.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These undergrads are the best students I&#8217;ve taught in the year,&#8221; said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miljkovi&#263;, who is also a lecturer at Stanford University. "</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first day we did assessments. I asked them, 'Which businesses do you want to work with? What is your passion? What are the things you love to do?&#8217;"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses that wish to work with GetVirtual reach out to the partnership online. The founders and the students vet the businesses, making sure that the companies are the right match for GetVirtual and its services. GetVirtual is most interested in those that need help the most.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GetVirtual would be less inclined to work with a company with more complicated requests.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For example, we wouldn&#8217;t build a big company a $10,000 website for free,&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miljkovi&#263; said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are picking the lowest-hanging fruit. We want to help the most businesses as possible. If a business needs a lot of programming that we don&#8217;t have the skills for, we&#8217;ll refer them to a professional.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Receiving mentorship from the younger generation</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students are paired with local businesses to help redesign their websites for e-commerce, product delivery services, curbside pickup, and other features that can help them stay afloat during these days of curtailed tourism, which was a lifeline for many local shops.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In these partnerships,&#160; the younger generation are mentors for business owners who are old enough to be their parents, or, in some cases, their grandparents. Technological fixes come naturally to these students, who relish the chance to keep these businesses viable. And many of the interns have a large bag of tricks at their disposal.</span></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are bringing together multiple technologies to the fore, including templatized web design, integration of point-of-sales systems and online payments channels, listing product catalogues on virtual marketplaces, and many other such plug-ins to cloud-based platforms,&#8221; said GetVirtual student intern Anagha Vijay (Crown, &#8216;22, computer science), who has been partnering with Beach Street Pizza and Bar and Pacific Cookie Company.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of like that old saying, &#8216;Give a man a fish and he&#8217;ll eat for a day. Teach him how to fish, and he&#8217;ll eat for the rest of his life,'" said GetVirtual&#8217;s operating officer Arin Spanner (Crown '20, business management/psychology), who has been working closely with Home/Work, a Soquel-based home furnishing shop. &#8220;When we make sure these small businesses can deliver services during the pandemic, we give them the tools to sustain themselves.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GetVirtual partnerships are easily duplicated, Spanner said. With input from other GetVirtual interns, Spanner recently contributed an op-ed piece to Monterey Bay region tech resource Santa Cruz Tech Beat in which he described these partnerships as &#8220;turnkey operations that any college can &#8216;pull off the shelf, and just add water,&#8217; complete with everything we&#8217;ve developed&#8212;systems, methodologies, and tools, combined with our institutional knowledge that enables colleges to easily adopt the GetVirtual course, add an instructor, partner with local economic development groups, and engage with local small businesses and extend their business virtually.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Spanner, working with Santa Cruz businesses such as Home/Work has been so rewarding that it has influenced his long-term career goals.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;High-powered businessmen and high-frequency traders make a lot of money,&#8217;&#8217; he said. &#8220;But this has opened me up to the ways that business acumen and skills can be used for helping others. I really like (the small business owners). They&#8217;re good people. These businesses are not only the proverbial backbone of the Santa Cruz economy. They&#8217;re also the heart and soul.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Tapping into brainpower and ingenuity&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The partnership has been just as rewarding to Home/Work&#8217;s owner Sonia McMoran. Pairing up with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GetVirtual interns is &#8220;a wonderful way to use the intelligence that we have at our fingertips, with all these incredibly smart students at UC Santa Cruz. Now there&#8217;s a way to tap into all that brainpower and ingenuity.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic made McMoran realize just how many obstacles she faced. In her conversations with Get/Virtual, she made this point clear. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She understood design and aesthetics, &#8220;but what about the nitty gritty? What about the back end? How do I optimize the site to get traffic to the store? How do I engage with customers and keep them (on the Home/Work site)?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first she wondered just how much a group of college students could assess and address the store&#8217;s challenges.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They are not my ideal customer, not my demographic,&#8217;&#8217; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the students&#8217; savvy and practical insights turned her into an instant believer. McMoran, like many business owners, is pressed for time. She has just one employee to help run the business, and is homeschooling her 9-year-old son. She wanted to look into options to expedite filling and delivering orders &#8220;but the research can get overwhelming. I didn&#8217;t have the time or the mental bandwidth. The fact that GetVirtual could hear me out about the problem, do the research for me, and give me my top three choices, with pros and cons for each of them, was amazing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Training entrepreneurs</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Get/Virtual internships are part of a thriving entrepreneurship training program based at Crown College.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;GetVirtual internships </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">represent service learning at its best,&#8221; said Crown College Provost Manel Camps, professor of microbiology and environmental toxicology. &#8220;They give our students the opportunity to implement the concepts they learned in class to make a real difference in the world, in the process connecting the university with its surrounding community in a meaningful way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Note that this work is all done in teams that are getting feedback at multiple points, modeling effective teamwork,&#8221; Camps continued. &#8220;This is a transferable skill that will serve our students well in any career. I wish we could do something like this for every program on campus."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That problem-solving philosophy and teamwork has made an oversized impact for Pacific Trading Company, a fashionable downtown Santa Cruz boutique that faced an uncertain future after it had to close its doors early on in the COVID-19 pandemic.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GetVirtual helped the business transfer its long-standing tradition of in-person appointments to the online realm. Soon, customers will be able to use an online scheduler, including a &#8220;style quiz" that helps Pacific Trading Company&#8217;s staff zero in on what they are looking for.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We then pre-shop for them and present a curated collection just for them on Zoom," said Pacific Trading Company owner </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rama Zoe Heinrich</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. "Our unofficial launch has been super fun and successful."&#160;</span></p>

<p>Field courses build the self-confidence and "scientific competence" of all students, but the benefits are particularly noteworthy for students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields, who are more likely to switch majors or drop out of college, according to researchers at UC Santa Cruz who have published the results of the study in the journal <em>Ecology and Evolution</em>.</p>
<p>The article, "Field Courses Narrow Demographic Achievement Gaps in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology," sheds light on the benefits field courses offer students and the role they could play in boosting the retention and success of underrepresented students.</p>
<p>The study compared UCSC undergraduates admitted from 2008 to 2019 who participated in a field course to those who did not. Demographic data for race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, first-generation college student, and gender were collected. In addition to greater self-confidence, the findings reveal that students who take field courses are more likely to graduate from college, have higher GPAs at graduation, and are more likely to stay in the ecology and evolutionary biology major. Even a modest, two-unit field course produces benefits for students: at UCSC, Biology 82: Introduction to Field Research meets once a week with two overnight weekend field trips.</p>
<p>"Field courses offer some potentially high-impact services that aren't available in traditional lecture courses," said postdoctoral researcher and first author Roxanne Beltran. "Students in field courses work as a team and collaborate rather than compete for the best grade. They get to sit around a campfire and feel like part of a community. And they are interacting with faculty who aren't standing behind a lectern, which can be intimidating."</p>
<p>As participants build confidence in field courses, the experience creates "a self-fulfilling prophecy of success," she said. "It's a feedback loop. Students see that they can be successful, which builds their confidence, which leads to further success."</p>
<p>Beltran, who is completing a two-year fellowship funded by the National Science Foundation and the UC President&#8217;s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, says field courses are one of the best investment colleges and universities can make in "saving dreams" of aspiring scientists.</p>
<p>"Diversity in STEM fields is critical," said Beltran. "Scientists can help solve global challenges like disease outbreaks and climate change. But we can't do that without the diversity of ideas that comes from diverse experiences. Our success is tied unequivocally to the diversity of the scientists doing the work."</p>
<p><em><u>Saving dreams and closing demographic gaps</u></em></p>
<p>For aspiring biology majors, the first two years of college courses are dominated by what some call the "math-science death march": a series of required courses in math, chemistry, physics, and biology that are a far cry from the vision that propels most undergraduates.</p>
<p>"Students who want to do biology in college have a vision of studying trees, or birds, or soils, or marine invertebrates in the intertidal zone," said senior author Erika Zavaleta, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC. "They have a vision of discovery, of being outside, of doing data collection."</p>
<p>Field courses give students hands-on experience doing science in collaboration with their peers: identifying species, designing and conducting experiments, analyzing data, and doing oral presentations of results. "Field courses have a big positive impact on students' sense of their scientific capacity," said Zavaleta. "It's true for all students, but it's bigger for underrepresented groups than any other."</p>
<p>In the study, which focused on the self-efficacy benefits of field courses, underrepresented students ranked their own sense of ability lower before they participated in the field course, but they emerged from the course with their sense of self-efficacy on par or ahead of their non-underrepresented peers, she noted.</p>
<p>"The course closed a demographic gap," said Zavaleta. "That's so exciting."</p>
<p>Field courses may be more expensive than large lecture courses, which Zavaleta said are "very efficient." "But you get what you pay for," she said. "The impact on students is greater. We need to rethink how much we invest in these experiences."</p>
<p>"If students have an early opportunity that validates what being a scientist is, that can carry them and keep them going until they get upper-division opportunities to do an internship, or a research project, or a senior thesis," said Zavaleta. "Let's give these students the opportunity to do what they came here to do before they get to year three of their college experience."</p>
<p><em><u>Retaining diversity in STEM </u></em></p>
<p>Undergraduates from diverse demographic backgrounds arrive at college equally interested in studying biology, but students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields are significantly less likely to earn a biology degree, either because they switch majors or leave campus entirely, said Zavaleta. That phenomenon, which takes place at colleges and universities across the country, has put the focus on retaining STEM students.</p>
<p>"They&#8217;re coming to us across the board wanting to do biology, and it's on us to keep them and help them succeed," said Zavaleta, noting that most students leave the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology major during their first year or two.</p>
<p>Boosting self-efficacy is one part of a retention strategy, but efforts must also address building a sense of belonging and a sense of community for underrepresented students, noted Zavaleta, a veteran field-course instructor. "Field courses are such an important tool because they tackle both," she said. "There's nothing like making a meal together on a camping trip, or identifying a grass, or sloshing in a stream, or sitting around a campfire to build a sense of community."</p>
<p>Beltran, a UCSC alumna, recalled struggling to find her place in 400-student lecture courses before she enrolled in a quarter-long field course with Zavaleta. "I'm studying these students, because I was one of them," said Beltran. "I was questioning whether I deserved to be in college, and whether I could have a career in science." The field course rekindled the desire she'd had in high school, and in July, she will join the UCSC faculty as an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology (EEB).</p>
<p>"The emphasis was really different when I was an undergraduate student," she said. "We've learned a lot since then about the importance of teaching in nontraditional ways."</p>
<p><em><u>Encouraging all students to feel welcome</u></em></p>
<p>In the study, the researchers found that underrepresented students are less likely to enroll in field courses. That problem, however, is not insurmountable.</p>
<p>"We've spent five years flipping that," said Zavaleta, a dedicated advocate of STEM diversity who received a $1 million grant in 2017 from the <a href="https://www.hhmi.org/">Howard Hughes Medical Institute</a> to fund a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/12/hhmi-professors.html">five-year effort</a> to support students in ecology and conservation biology all the way through to graduation. Her program provides increased access to research-based field courses and internships, as well as mentoring and a supportive community, with the goal of launching a diverse new generation of conservation leaders.</p>
<p>"We think of field courses as gated and maybe elitist, because they can be expensive, or we think they're only for students who already have camping equipment and experience," said Zavaleta. But those barriers can be overcome, she said. When Biology 82 was introduced, instructors Don Croll and Gage Dayton made a concerted effort to get the word out to all students through UCSC's ten colleges, student groups and organizations, and academic advisers. Scholarships remove cost barriers, and the relatively small weekend time commitment helps make the course available to students who work, she noted.</p>
<p>"Over time, the word gets out, and now we have students across campus participating&#8212;not just white students, not just wealthy students, not just biology students, and most haven't camped before," said Zavaleta, noting that Biology 82 is offered six times per year but still can't meet student demand. "If you tackle the relatively easy barriers, field courses become an engine for inclusion and equity."</p>
<p>Zavaleta is excited by the results of the study "because they show us that it's true."</p>
<p>"Why can't every student in the major have a field experience?" she asked. "Why can't every student in the division? Every student on campus? This is how UCSC started: It was all about inquiry in peer groups. We know how to do this, and we are doing it. We just need to do it for everybody."</p>
<p>Additional coauthors on the study include Don Croll, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology; Gage Dayton, administrative director of the UCSC Natural Reserve System; Erin Marnocha, program coordinator with the UC Natural Reserve System; and Alexandra Race, a graduate student in education at UCSC.</p>

<ul>
<li>a systemwide freeze on salaries for policy-covered staff employees;</li>
<li>a systemwide freeze on salary scales for policy-covered, non-student academic appointees. To ensure a stable faculty pipeline and to maintain our teaching and research enterprise, we will continue the regular academic peer-review merit advancement program;</li>
<li>a voluntary pay cut of 10 percent for current Chancellors and myself.</li>
</ul>
<div>As we continue to address the current and anticipated shortfalls in our funding, we are also taking the following actions:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Developing budget scenarios for locations and UCOP that anticipate budget cuts for the coming 2020-21 fiscal year. Each UC location faces unique circumstances which will require different budgetary strategies and actions, so cuts will not necessarily be uniform across the system;</li>
<li>Initiating discussions with our union leaders to be sure they understand the current reality of our financial circumstances;</li>
<li>Continuing to look for ways to reduce expenses such as eliminating non-essential travel and renegotiating service agreements.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Like many other organizations, UC is facing significant financial impacts as a result of the pandemic. From mid-March through April alone, we estimate that systemwide financial losses totaled nearly $1.2 billion, and we anticipate these losses will continue to climb in the months ahead. Needless to say, this significant loss of revenue is having an enormous negative effect on our budgets. Additionally, Governor Newsom last week announced a revised State budget for 2020-21 that includes a 10 percent funding reduction for UC of $372 million.<br/><br/>We continue to work closely with the State of California and the federal government to secure any and all additional funding available to help address the shortfalls. Much of this funding is designated for student financial aid, and while we are grateful for the funding, we do not anticipate full reimbursement for our losses.<br/><br/>We are a strong organization and will work over time to address our losses and recover. The present realities and ongoing uncertainties, however, require us to take actions in order to adjust to current circumstances, resume our in-person research and teaching activities in a safe and gradual way, and help protect employees&#8217; jobs. We will also need to continue to closely monitor our finances, and consider additional actions as appropriate.<br/><br/>I know some of this news is unsettling, during an already difficult time. I want to thank you for your continued commitment to the University and the people we serve.

They&#8217;ve begun research on how people in different cultures might perceive social distancing and how online learning is affecting people with disabilities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s all part of two UC Santa Cruz undergraduate classes that are focusing on the effects and experiences of this pandemic, even while the pandemic is under way. Titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coronavirus and Community</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living and Learning in a Pandemicene</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the courses are being taught, respectively, by Assistant Professor of Sociology Rebecca London and Professor of Sociology Jenny Reardon. There are 46 students in the two classes, all of them upper division.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I just felt like now was not the time to sit out and not engage with students who were actually sheltering in place all over California and who could teach us a lot about what this pandemic is like,&#8221; said Reardon, who is founding director of the Science and Justice Research Center on campus. &#8220;Both for me and my students, it was about trying to make sense of what was going on.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Studying the pandemic, creating community</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She invited 12 interested students, most of them from her previous </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sociology of Health and Medicine</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> class, to take part in the weekly seminar course, which was designed not only to bring speakers from around the country to discuss the pandemic but also allow students to do their own research on topics that range from examining who is considered an &#8220;essential worker&#8221; in a pandemic to what it means to give humanitarian assistance to other countries. Reardon also saw the seminar as a way to create a community of support and help students navigate through the daily barrage of bad, and sometimes contradictory, news.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Little did Reardon know when she began the seminar how the pandemic would affect her own life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One topic we talk about is this idea of &#8216;reworlding,&#8217;&#8221; said Lucia Vitale, a Ph.D. student in politics who is a TA for the seminar. &#8220;We look at what will the world look like when everything is &#8216;over.&#8217; Are we going to go back to how things were, or are we going to use this juncture to demand better treatment for people? Students have had insightful perspective on what that would look like.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vitale noted that students have published some of their research in </span><a href="https://scijust.ucsc.edu/2020/05/08/covid-19-zine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog posts and will produce a zine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the end of the quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speakers have included or will include Rebecca Herzig, professor of gender and sexuality studies at Bates College; Joseph Fins, a professor of medical ethics at Weill Medical College at Cornell University, who worked on New York&#8217;s ventilator guidelines; and Rebecca Gutman, vice president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students are also expected to present a weekly source of inspiration or support to the class, an assignment that has led to direct action, according to Reardon. For instance, one student began creating artwork to sell in support of hard-hit nonprofits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reardon said that at the beginning of the seminar, she was most excited by the prospect of leading a course about the pandemic, &#8220;but now I think it&#8217;s just as important for the community it provides. It&#8217;s motivation to constructively engage instead of being overwhelmed by the bad news we get every day. The focus is on: How do we live and not just learn? How do you orient yourself in this moment?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That question came to the forefront when Reardon&#8217;s mother died unexpectedly&#8212;although not from COVID-19&#8212;and, because of shelter-in-place regulations, Reardon would have had to self-quarantine for 14 days if she attended the funeral. Instead she watched online.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who knew I was going to be the person most dramatically affected by COVID-19?&#8221; Reardon said.</span></p>
<p><strong>Research in real time</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">London decided to focus her community research practicum on COVID-19. About the same time, she read a call for papers on the pandemic from the journal </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contexts,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a publication of the American Sociological Association.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I adapted that call for the class,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her 34 students, now scattered around the state, are conducting research on topics that range from exploring the question of how the shift to online learning affects disabled students to the way moving back home changes how college students feel about themselves.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students are analyzing data, sending out surveys, doing Zoom interviews, and preparing ethnographies, according to London. They are writing papers and preparing videos.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Essentially what I&#8217;m doing is guiding students through a real-life research project and helping them figure out how to ask good research questions, how to collect and analyze data, and report back findings,&#8221; said London, who also has scheduled a series of Zoom interviews with those in the forefront of the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><strong>Studying a society in flux</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Isabelle Ansari (Kresge &#8217;20, sociology), her research for the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living and Learning in a Pandemicene</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> course revealed the distinction between ways of helping in a crisis like this pandemic. Examining the work of two young women who are providing food, water, and help to 300 hard-hit families on the Wind River reservation in Wyoming, Ansari said she learned the difference between mutual aid and charity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230; [T]he former being long-term oriented and aware of the structures that reproduce vulnerability for some and uplift others, and the latter just temporary resource reallocation,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I also have been thinking a lot about the importance of attending to the deep, qualitative aspects of this moment as we simultaneously juggle the mass of statistics getting thrown at us from everywhere.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s interesting is that this (pandemic) is affecting all of us at the same time, and it feels like we have no control over what happens,&#8221; London said. &#8220;This class makes me feel like I have a little control, and I think it makes students feel the same way, too. One of the major outcomes of the course is to allow our students to apply sociological critical thinking and knowledge to a society that is experiencing rapid changes. What better way to study what is going on than in the middle of it?&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url/><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="29e409518072701763b3cba6c8ab7ca9"><name>alexa-challenge</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus team a finalist in Amazon's Alexa challenge</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz’s Team Athena is one of five teams remaining in the Alexa Prize Socialbot Grand Challenge from a field of 375 applicants from around the world. </summary><start-date>1589785200000</start-date><path>/2020/05/alexa-challenge</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/05/alexa-challenge</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1589840709939</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1590189281552</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Lisa Renner</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/alexa-team-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/alexa-team-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alexa-team-500.jpg</name><display-name>alexa-team-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>301276</file-size><width>500</width><height>370</height></image><image-alt>UCSC's Alexa team</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/alexa-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/alexa-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alexa-80px.jpg</name><display-name>alexa-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>19220</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>UCSC's Alexa team</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The UC Santa Cruz team is led by faculty adviser Marilyn Walker, professor of computer science and engineering.

<p>UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Team Athena is one of five teams remaining in the Alexa Prize Socialbot Grand Challenge from a field of 375 applicants from around the world. Competitors included UC Davis, UC Irvine, and UC San Diego; Stanford University, Czech Technical University, and Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.</p>
<p>The winner will be announced in July.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, it feels really rewarding and exciting,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz team co-leader Jurik Juraska about making the finals. The 29-year-old Ph.D. student from Slovakia interestingly earned his bachelor&#8217;s and master&#8217;s degrees from competitor Czech Technical University.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz team is led by faculty adviser Marilyn Walker, professor of computer science and engineering, and includes seven graduate students and one undergraduate who work in her Natural Language and Dialogue Systems lab. In addition to the team leaders, Davan Harrison and Jurik Juraska, the graduate student members are Kevin Bowden, Jiaqi Wu, Lena Reed, Rishi Rajasekaran and Nikhil Varghese. The undergraduate member is Abteen Ebrahimi. Other faculty members who have assisted the effort are Steve Whittaker (computational media) and Jeff Flanigan (computer science and engineering).</p>
<p>&#8220;This team has worked together amazingly well and created a strongly competitive and interesting conversational system,&#8221; Walker said.</p>
<p>The group has been working since September on the challenge of creating a bot that can converse coherently and engagingly for 20 minutes with people over Alexa, a virtual assistant developed by Amazon. The bot must be able to discuss such topics as current events, entertainment, sports, politics, technology, and fashion.</p>
<p>Davan Harrison, the 31-year-old UC Santa Cruz co-team leader and Ph.D. student, said the project is difficult because it deals with open-ended rather than goal-oriented conversation. Goal-oriented conversation deals with clear tasks where it&#8217;s easy to predict what the questions and answers will be. Open-ended conversation, by contrast, has no definite direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes this project so much more challenging is people can say anything next,&#8221; Harrison said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no clear goal, there&#8217;s no agenda to provide the dialogue system.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bot must recognize different types of speech, understand movie names, song names, people&#8217;s names, and now, even know about COVID&#8211;19. &#8220;It&#8217;s such a major topic that we made sure our system can talk to users about that as well,&#8221; said Juraska.</p>
<p>All bots in the competition are anonymously tested by Alexa users, who are then asked to give ratings at how well they work. The team members can then review the conversations without names or locations of the users attached.</p>
<p>The users include everyone from children to seniors and encompass people with different walks of life and interests. &#8220;It&#8217;s been nice seeing the wide applications of the system and the diversity of potential users,&#8221; Harrison said.</p>
<p>On a more serious note, the conversations sometimes reveal the users&#8217; emotional state and sometimes show they are depressed. This makes Harrison think that a well-designed socialbot could have a useful effect by offering positive emotional support or feedback.</p>
<p>Working on this project in the midst of a pandemic has offered its own challenges. At first, the team was meeting regularly in person but then everything switched to remote communications when the state shut-down order went into place. Harrison said he definitely misses getting to use office space on campus.</p>
<p>Like everyone else, the team has had to contend with canceled plans, including a trip to Seattle in March to meet competitors and the upcoming finals event, which was supposed to be in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re lucky that most of our work can continue remotely,&#8221; Harrison said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2d9c938a8072701763b3cba693340d58"><name>lick-masks</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>With a focus on public safety, Lick staff member turns to making masks</title><summary>As a quilter with more than 40 years experience, Michele Redel decided to start making masks for the close-knit community at Lick Observatory.</summary><start-date>1589871600000</start-date><display-name>COVID-19 response</display-name><path>/2020/05/lick-masks</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/05/lick-masks</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1589903135601</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1589903135601</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/redel-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/redel-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>redel-500px.jpg</name><display-name>redel-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>165967</file-size><width>500</width><height>337</height></image><image-alt>Michele Redel</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/redel-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/redel-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>redel-80px.jpg</name><display-name>redel-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>13944</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Michele Redel</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The community&#8217;s health and safety has been a constant through Michele Redel&#8217;s career. She worked as a nurse for 30 years, recently retired as the safety coordinator for the Lick Observatory, and remains employed as the chief licensed water operator for the observatory.</p>
<p>When the pandemic hit locally, Redel thought about how she could help. As a quilter with more than 40 years experience, she decided to start making masks for the close-knit community at Lick Observatory. She sewed 50 masks for the Lick community, and expanded her work to support the campus community, completing 200 masks.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one knows when this pandemic will be over or what changes to our lives it will bring, whether temporary or indefinite,&#8221; Redel said. &#8220;The community at Lick Observatory will be here to hit it head on and do our part to support Lick Observatory as a community and the University of California, Santa Cruz as a whole.&#8221;</p>

But the discovery by an international team of astronomers of a massive rotating disk galaxy, seen when the universe was only ten percent of its current age, challenges the traditional models of galaxy formation. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The discovery, </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2276-y"><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">reported May 20 in </span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Nature</i></span></u></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>,</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span> was made with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). </span></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Galaxy DLA0817g, nicknamed the Wolfe Disk after the late astronomer Arthur M. Wolfe, is the most distant rotating disk galaxy ever observed. The unparalleled power of ALMA made it possible to see this galaxy spinning at 170 miles (272 kilometers) per second, similar to our Milky Way.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Its properties are astonishingly similar to our own galaxy, despite being only 1.5 billion years old,&#8221; said coauthor J. Xavier Prochaska, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">While previous studies hinted at the existence of these early rotating gas-rich disk galaxies, thanks to ALMA we now have unambiguous evidence that they occur as early as 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang,&#8221; said lead author Marcel Neeleman of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><strong>How did the Wolfe Disk form?</strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The discovery of the Wolfe Disk provides a challenge for many galaxy formation simulations, which predict that massive galaxies at this point in the evolution of the cosmos grew through many mergers of smaller galaxies and hot clumps of gas.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Most galaxies that we find early in the universe look like train wrecks because they underwent consistent and often violent merging,&#8221; explained Neeleman. &#8220;These hot mergers make it difficult to form well-ordered, cold, rotating disks like we observe in our present universe.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In most galaxy formation scenarios, galaxies only start to show a well-formed disk around 6 billion years after the Big Bang. The fact that the astronomers found such a disk galaxy when the universe was only ten percent of its current age indicates that other growth processes must have dominated.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">We think the Wolfe Disk has grown primarily through the steady accretion of cold gas,&#8221; Prochaska said. &#8220;Still, one of the questions that remains is how to assemble such a large gas mass while maintaining a relatively stable, rotating disk.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><strong>Star formation</strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The team also used the National Science Foundation&#8217;s Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to learn more about star formation in the Wolfe Disk. In radio wavelengths, ALMA looked at the galaxy&#8217;s movements and mass of atomic gas and dust, while the VLA measured the amount of molecular mass&#8212;the fuel for star formation. Hubble observed massive stars in ultraviolet light. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The star formation rate in the Wolfe Disk is at least ten times higher than in our own galaxy,&#8221; Prochaska said. &#8220;It must be one of the most productive disk galaxies in the early universe.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><strong>A &#8216;normal&#8217; galaxy</strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The Wolfe Disk was first discovered by ALMA in 2017. Neeleman and his team found the galaxy when they examined the light from a more distant quasar. The light from the quasar was absorbed as it passed through a massive reservoir of hydrogen gas surrounding the galaxy, which is how it revealed itself. Rather than looking for direct light from extremely bright, but more rare galaxies, astronomers used this absorption method to find fainter and more &#8216;normal&#8217; galaxies in the early universe.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The fact that we found the Wolfe Disk using this method tells us that it belongs to the normal population of galaxies present at early times,&#8221; said Neeleman. &#8220;When our newest observations with ALMA surprisingly showed that it is rotating, we realized that early rotating disk galaxies are not as rare as we thought and that there should be a lot more of them out there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In addition to Neeleman and Prochaska, the coauthors of the paper include Nissim Kanekar at the National Center for Radio Astrophysics in Pune, India, and Mark Rafelski at the Space Telescope Science Institute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year&#8217;s exhibition, the 34th annual, typically would be installed at the Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery at Porter College on the UCSC campus. But, as we all know, this is a spring unlike any other. With campus closed because of COVID-19 precautions and a physical exhibition out of the question, Irwin 2020 has gone virtual.&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Titled &#8220;Collective Solitude,&#8221; this year&#8217;s exhibition features 13 artists whose works speak to this extraordinary period in history and draws inspiration from the struggle against great distances for connection.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The select student artists are: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aar&#243;n Mart&#237;nez</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Anastasia Oleson, Angel Gonzales, Chloe Murr, Dominic Ramirez, Edgar Cruz, Emma McWaid, Jocelyn Lee, Joshua Zupan, Morgan Tomfohr, Natalie Del Castillo, Rodrigo Ramos, and Veriche Blackwell.</span>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the experience and responsibility of receiving an Irwin scholarship is planning and curating the exhibition each year. With the gallery closed, &#8220;everybody kind of assumed this was the next best thing,&#8221; said Joshua Zupan, a member of the promotion committee. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zupan, a&#160; printmaker who works with wood block, etching, and drawing, said he and his fellow student artists organized themselves into different planning committees. They&#8217;ve been meeting weekly via Zoom and exchanging countless emails.&#160; &#8220;Everybody is doing it on the fly,&#8221; said Zupan, who is about to graduate with a double major in art and ecology and evolutionary biology. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students are wrapping up their projects and will begin &#8220;installing&#8221; them soon in the virtual gallery. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea for a virtual gallery first came up a couple of years ago when Shelby Graham, director and curator of the Sesnon Art Gallery, met a virtual gallery startup company, Geopogo, at a California Association of Museums conference. They began collaborating on a prototype virtual 3D model of the Sesnon Art Gallery using the Charles Griffin Farr collection. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We launched the virtual Charles Griffin Farr exhibition in 2018 on our website, and I have been using it as a teaching tool at UCSC in my curatorial practices classes,&#8221; Graham said.&#160; <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then in 2020 when the pandemic hit, it made perfect sense to use the virtual model concept for the Irwin show, but we knew we needed a new model featuring all three of our gallery venues at Porter College.&#8221; <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colleen Jennings, Digital Arts and New Media technical coordinator, has <a href="https://art.ucsc.edu/sesnon/new-technologies-sesnon-gallery">designed the new virtual exhibition space</a>, using an architectural software program called SketchUp. &#8220;The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">freedom to navigate a space on your own terms is one of the key experiences of the gallery </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">visitor when using this 3D model,&#8221; Jennings said. &#8220;Moving at your own pace through each section is built into 3D interaction.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graham said she and gallery manager&#160; Louise Leong are learning the programs so they can use the virtual model as a curatorial and planning tool for upcoming exhibitions. They have dedicated one of the Sesnon webpages to virtual online exhibitions: </span><a href="https://art.ucsc.edu/sesnon/virtual-exhibitions-and-events"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://art.ucsc.edu/sesnon/virtual-exhibitions-and-events</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Whether remote or within reach, a work of art, an artist's work, gives form to their relationship to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">community and a history of art through provocative, anxious or beautiful manifestations about the unknown,&#8221; said associate professor in painting, Melissa Gwyn. &#8220;In this year of so many </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unknowns, the Irwin Scholarships have given these young artists the opportunity to amplify the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">potential of those relationships.&#8221;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The late Sue Irwin established the William Hyde and Susan Benteen Irwin Scholarship Fund in 1986 in honor of her husband and as a way of ensuring that others would have the kind of art education that allowed her to flourish in the art community.</span><br/><br/><hr/>

She expects to begin her new position in October 2020.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Greider is currently a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor, Daniel Nathans Professor, and department director for Molecular Biology and Genetics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. She has been visiting UC Santa Cruz while on sabbatical leave since September 2019. A native Californian with deep roots in the UC system, she will be joining a department at UC Santa Cruz with strengths in areas that mesh well with her research, including RNA biology, genomics, cancer biology, and stem cell biology.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The science here in MCD Biology is fantastic, and I&#8217;ve been impressed by the rigorous training for graduate students,&#8221; Greider said. &#8220;I also see opportunities to make a difference in terms of underserved populations and women in science, which are issues I care a lot about and which seem to be part of the bedrock here at UCSC, not just something added on top, so that structures are set up to support efforts in those areas.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Greider shared the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her pioneering work on telomeres, critical structures that maintain the ends of chromosomes, and the discovery of telomerase, the enzyme that maintains telomere length. Telomeres are stretches of repetitive DNA at the ends of chromosomes, often compared to the plastic tips that keep the ends of shoelaces from unraveling. Telomere shortening is associated with aging and age-related diseases.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Greider discovered telomerase as a graduate student in Elizabeth Blackburn&#8217;s laboratory at UC Berkeley. Throughout her career, she has been a leading researcher</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> in telomerase biochemistry, telomere function, and the critical roles that telomeres serve, including maintaining genome stability, preventing cancer, and modulating senescence and aging. One of her current focus areas is studying degenerative human diseases caused by short telomeres. She will establish a new laboratory at UC Santa Cruz to continue her telomere research program.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">As a member of numerous advisory boards and high-profile national commissions, Greider has helped guide programs and initiatives for major institutions and contributed to national policy reports on issues ranging from sexual harassment to biomedical research ethics. She served on a working group for the director of the National Institutes of Health on &#8220;Changing Culture to End Sexual Harassment,&#8221; which issued its report in January. She is the first author with other scientific leaders of a high-visibility 2019 policy paper in the journal </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Science</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> on &#8220;Increasing Gender Diversity in the STEM Research Workforce.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Carol is a very highly accomplished and respected scientist and advocate for women and minorities in science,&#8221; said Susan Strome, distinguished professor and chair of MCD biology at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;She is also an energetic, down-to-earth person and a wonderful colleague. We are lucky to have her join us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In addition to the Nobel Prize, which she shared with Elizabeth Blackburn and Jack Szostak, Greider was awarded the 2006 Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research and has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and American Association for the Advancement of Science. She earned her B.A. in biology from the College of Creative Studies at UC Santa Barbara and her Ph.D. in molecular biology at UC Berkeley. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">When asked why she wants to move from Johns Hopkins to UC Santa Cruz, Greider said, &#8220;The science at UCSC is fabulous. Change is good for creativity, and I want to be in a different environment with good colleagues to talk to.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Greider added that she enjoys living in Santa Cruz and has found it to be a very welcoming community. An avid swimmer, she began swimming in the ocean with her masters swimming group after the pools were closed due to COVID-19. &#8220;I was even on the front page of the </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Sentinel</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">&#8212;I think my swim cap caught the attention of the photographer,&#8221; she said. &#8220;People have asked me if I&#8217;m going to learn to surf, and I said it&#8217;s not at the top of my list. But now that I&#8217;ll be staying here, I think I&#8217;m going to try it.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3443c4c98072701763b3cba66e536b04"><name>scam-message1</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Beware of scam involving messages from professors, colleagues</title><summary>Campus police ask members of the campus community to beware of a phishing scam that involves text messages or emails that appear to come from a professor or a university colleague.

The researchers have now found all of the missing &#8216;normal&#8217; matter in the vast space between galaxies.</p>
<p>The discovery, published May 27 in <em>Nature</em>, was made by studying massive flashes of energy from deep space, called fast radio bursts.</p>
<p>&#8220;For decades, we have unsuccessfully searched for this missing matter with our largest telescopes. The discovery and localization of fast radio bursts was the key breakthrough needed to solve this mystery,&#8221; said corresponding author J. Xavier Prochaska, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Lead author Jean-Pierre Macquart at the Curtin University node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) in Australia said astronomers have been searching for the missing matter for almost 30 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know from measurements of the big bang how much matter there was in the beginning of the universe,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But when we looked out into the present universe, we couldn&#8217;t find half of what should be there. It was a bit of an embarrassment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macquart said the missing matter was found lurking in the vast emptiness between stars and galaxies. &#8220;Intergalactic space is very sparse,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The missing matter was equivalent to only one or two atoms in a room the size of a normal office. So it's very hard to detect this matter using traditional techniques.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers were able to directly detect the missing matter using the phenomenon of fast radio bursts&#8212;brief flashes of energy that appear to come from random directions in the sky and last for just milliseconds. Scientists don&#8217;t know what causes them, but it must involve incredible energy, equivalent to the amount released by the sun in 80 years.</p>
<p>Macquart said the team detected the missing matter by using fast radio bursts as &#8220;cosmic weigh stations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The radiation from fast radio bursts gets spread out by the missing matter in the same way that you see the colors of sunlight being separated in a prism,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve now been able to measure the distances to enough fast radio bursts to determine the density of the universe. We only needed six to find this missing matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The missing matter in this case is baryonic or &#8216;ordinary&#8217; matter&#8212;like the protons and neutrons that make up all the elements in planets and stars. It&#8217;s different from dark matter, which remains elusive and accounts for about 85 percent of the total matter in the universe.</p>
<p>The research team also pinned down the relationship between how far away a fast radio burst is and how the burst disperses as it travels through the universe.</p>
<p>"We've discovered the equivalent of the Hubble-Lemaitre Law for galaxies, only for fast radio bursts," Macquart said. "The Hubble-Lemaitre Law, which was discovered in the 1920s, underpins all measurements of galaxies at cosmological distances.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fast radio bursts used in the study were detected using CSIRO&#8217;s Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope, which is located in outback Western Australia. ASKAP&#8217;s abilities were crucial to this study, said coauthor Ryan Shannon at Swinburne University.</p>
<p>&#8220;ASKAP has both a wide field of view, about 60 times the size of the full moon, and can image in high resolution,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This means that we can catch the bursts with relative ease and then pinpoint locations to their host galaxies with incredible precision.&#8221;</p>
<p>ASKAP is a precursor for the future Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope. The SKA could observe large numbers of fast radio bursts, giving astronomers a new way to study the previously invisible structure in the universe.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="522e700c8072701763b3cba666858c31"><name>exoplanet-clouds</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomers create cloud atlas for hot, Jupiter-like exoplanets</title><summary>Giant planets in our solar system and circling other stars have exotic clouds unlike anything on Earth, and the gas giants orbiting close to their stars—so called hot Jupiters—boast the most extreme.</summary><keywords>Jonathan Fortney</keywords><start-date>1590476400000</start-date><display-name>Astronomers create cloud atlas for hot, Jupiter-like exoplanets</display-name><path>/2020/05/exoplanet-clouds</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/05/exoplanet-clouds</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1590516674545</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1590534110792</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Robert Sanders (UC Berkeley)</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/exoplanet-clouds-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/exoplanet-clouds-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>exoplanet-clouds-450.jpg</name><display-name>exoplanet-clouds-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>76202</file-size><width>450</width><height>222</height></image><image-alt>illustration of clouds</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/exoplanet-clouds-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/exoplanet-clouds-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>exoplanet-clouds-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>exoplanet-clouds-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25833</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>illustration of clouds</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Predicted cloud altitudes and compositions for a range of temperatures common on hot Jupiter planets.

On cooler hot Jupiters, below about 950 Kelvin (1,250 degrees Fahrenheit), skies are dominated by a hydrocarbon haze, essentially smog.<br/><br/>The model will help astronomers studying the gases in the atmospheres of these strange and distant worlds, since clouds interfere with measurements of the atmospheric composition. It could also help planetary scientists understand the atmospheres of cooler giant planets and their moons, such as Jupiter and Saturn&#8217;s moon Titan in our own solar system.<br/><br/>&#8220;In studying planetary atmospheres in the solar system, we typically have the context of images. We have no such luck with exoplanets. They are just dots or shadows,&#8221; said Jonathan Fortney, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;That's a huge loss in information. But what we do have to make up for that is a much larger sample size. And that allows us to look for trends&#8212;here, a trend in cloudiness&#8212;with planetary temperature, something that we just don't have the luxury of in our solar system.&#8221;<br/><br/>Fortney and others at UCSC, UC Berkeley, and other institutions have been working on the model for the past two years. Peter Gao, a postdoctoral fellow now at UC Berkeley who will be joining Fortney at UCSC later this year, is first author of a paper describing the model <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1114-3">published May 25 in the journal <em>Nature Astronomy</em></a>.<br/><br/>&#8220;The kinds of clouds that can exist in these hot atmospheres are things that we don&#8217;t really think of as clouds in the solar system,&#8221; Gao said. &#8220;There have been models that predict various compositions, but the point of this study was to assess which of these compositions actually matter and compare the model to the available data that we have.&#8221;<br/><br/>The study takes advantage of a boom in the study of exoplanet atmospheres over the past decade. Though exoplanets are too distant and dim to be visible, many telescopes, in particular the Hubble Space Telescope, are able to focus on stars and capture starlight passing through the atmospheres of planets as they pass in front of their star. The wavelengths of light that are absorbed, revealed by spectroscopic measurements, tell astronomers which elements make up the atmosphere. To date, this technique and others have found or inferred the presence of water, methane, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, potassium and sodium gases and, in the hottest of the planets, vaporized aluminum oxide, iron and titanium.<br/><br/>But while some planets seem to have clear atmospheres and clear spectroscopic features, many have clouds that completely block the starlight filtering through, preventing the study of gases below the upper cloud layers. The composition of the gas can tell astronomers how exoplanets form and whether the building blocks of life are present around other stars.<br/><br/>&#8220;We have found a lot of clouds: some kinds of particles&#8212;not molecules, but small droplets&#8212;that are hanging out in these atmospheres,&#8221; Gao said. &#8220;We don't really know what they are made of, but they are contaminating our observations, essentially making it more difficult for us to assess the composition and abundances of important molecules like water and methane.&#8221;<br/><br/><strong>Ruby clouds</strong><br/><br/>Astronomers have proposed many strange types of clouds to explain these observations, composed of aluminum oxides, such as corundum, the stuff of rubies and sapphires; molten salt, such as potassium chloride; silicon oxides, or silicates, like quartz, the main component of sand; sulfides of manganese or zinc that exist as rocks on Earth; and organic hydrocarbon compounds. They could be liquid or solid aerosols, Gao said.<br/><br/>Gao adapted computer models initially created for Earth&#8217;s water clouds, and subsequently extended to the cloudy atmospheres of planets like Jupiter, which has ammonia and methane clouds. He expanded the model even further to the much higher temperatures seen on hot gas giant planets&#8212;up to 2,800 Kelvin, or 4,600 degrees Fahrenheit (2,500 degrees Celsius)&#8212;and the elements likely to condense into clouds at these temperatures.<br/><br/>The model takes into account how gases of various atoms or molecules condense into a droplet, how the droplets grow or evaporate and whether they are likely to be transported in the atmosphere by winds or updrafts or sink because of gravity.<br/><br/>&#8220;The idea is that the same physical principles guide the formation of all types of clouds,&#8221; said Gao, who has also modeled sulfuric acid clouds on Venus. &#8220;What I have done is to take this model and bring it out to the rest of the galaxy, making it able to simulate silicate clouds and iron clouds and salt clouds.&#8221;<br/><br/>He then compared his predictions to available data on 30 exoplanets, out of a total of about 70 transiting exoplanets with recorded transmission spectra to date.<br/><br/>The model revealed that many of the exotic clouds proposed over the years are difficult to form because the energy required to condense is too high. Silicate clouds condense easily, however, and dominate over a 1,200-degree Kelvin range of temperatures: from about 900 to 2,000 Kelvin. That&#8217;s a range of about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.<br/><br/>According to the model, in the hottest atmospheres, aluminum oxides and titanium oxides condense into high-level clouds. In exoplanets with cooler atmospheres, those clouds form deeper in the planet and are obscured by higher silicate clouds. On even cooler exoplanets, these silicate clouds also form deeper, leaving clear upper atmospheres. At even cooler temperatures, ultraviolet light from the star converts organic molecules like methane into extremely long hydrocarbon chains that form a high-level haze akin to smog. This smog can obscure lower-lying salt clouds of potassium or sodium chloride.<br/><br/>For those astronomers seeking a cloudless planet to more easily study the gases in the atmosphere, Gao suggested focusing on planets between about 900 and 1,400 Kelvin, or those hotter than about 2,200 Kelvin.<br/><br/>&#8220;The presence of clouds has been measured in a number of exoplanet atmospheres before, but it is when we look collectively at a large sample that we can pick apart the physics and chemistry in the atmospheres of these worlds,&#8221; said co-author Hannah Wakeford, an astrophysicist at the University of Bristol in the U.K. &#8220;The dominant cloud species is as common as sand&#8212;it is essentially sand&#8212;and it will be really exciting to be able to measure the spectral signatures of the clouds themselves for the first time with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.&#8221;<br/><br/>Future observations, such as those by NASA&#8217;s JWST, scheduled for launch within a few years, should be able to confirm these predictions, and perhaps shed light on the hidden cloud layers of planets closer to home. Gao said that similar exotic clouds may exist at depths within Jupiter or Saturn where the temperatures are close to those found on hot Jupiters.<br/><br/>&#8220;Because there are thousands of exoplanets versus just one Jupiter, we can study a bunch of them and see what the average is and how that compares to Jupiter,&#8221; Gao said.<br/><br/>He and his colleagues plan to test the model against observational data from other exoplanets and also brown dwarfs, which are basically gas giant planets so massive they&#8217;re almost a star. They, too, have clouds.<br/><br/>Other co-authors of the paper are Daniel Thorngren of the University of Montreal in Canada, Graham Lee of Oxford University in the U.K., Diana Powell and Xi Zhang of UC Santa Cruz, Caroline Morley of the University of Texas at Austin, and Kevin Stevenson of the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland.<br/><br/>Gao was supported by NASA&#8217;s postdoctoral program and a 51 Pegasi Fellowship from the Heising-Simons Foundation.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="52d043b08072701763b3cba658d0b269"><name>rydell-arts-fellow</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC faculty and alumni win Rydell Visual Arts Fellowships from Santa Cruz Community Foundation</title><summary>A dance lecturer and two alumni from the UC Santa Cruz Arts Division have been awarded Rydell Visual Arts Fellowships for 2020 and 2021 from Community Foundation Santa Cruz County.&#13;

<p><span>The awardees for 2020 are alumni <strong>Ann Altstatt</strong> (Digital Arts and New Media MFA, 2018) and <strong>Edward Ramirez</strong> (Fine Arts, 2015).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>For 2021, the winners are Theater Arts lecturer <strong>Cid Pearlman</strong> and <strong>Marc D&#8217;Estout</strong> (who served for a decade as director of art and design at UCSC Extension).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The four Santa Cruz County artists were selected from a pool of 59 visual artists.&#160;</span><span>Each fellowship recipient receives a $20,000 award to further their artistic career.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The Rydell fellowships were established by long-time Santa Cruz cultural icons Roy and Frances Rydell in 1985 to promote Santa Cruz County artists and arts organizations and are administered by the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz County. Following their passing, their estate was bequeathed to the Foundation, with the proceeds of the sale helping to grow the fund to its current level of over $2 million.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The fellowships help individual visual artists pursue their creative work and are made solely on the merits of their artistry and not tied to the completion of any specific projects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;With each round of fellows, we feel Frances and Roy looking over our shoulders as we have the privilege to be the custodians of their creative legacy,&#8221; said Susan True, the Foundation&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer. &#8220;We repeatedly see how this program enriches our community and allows local artists to have meaningful support to undertake their work.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Theater arts lecturer <strong>Cid Pearlman </strong>creates work that subtly disrupts traditional notions of desire, gender and friendship. Inspired by the resilience, fragility, and resourcefulness of the human body, her dance installations consider how we negotiate being together in a complex world.&#160;Pearlman&#8217;s work has been shown at numerous venues including ODC Theater, Joyce SoHo, Kanuti Gildi SAAL (Estonia), Getty Center, Santa Cruz MAH, Stockholm City Hall, and the Museum of Contemporary Art/San Diego. Her evening-length performance installation High Fall received a Lester Horton Award for Visual Design in 2002. small variations, with an original score by Joan Jeanrenaud, was nominated for two Horton Awards in 2006 and an Isadora Duncan Award in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span>Alumnus <strong>Edward M. Ramirez</strong> is a photographer and printmaker whose work addresses societal issues that challenge us in the world today. Born and raised in South Los Angeles to a working-class Salvadoran family, his early experiences and his family&#8217;s work ethic shaped and influenced his work and his commitment to social justice and equality. His work has been exhibited at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History, and the Sesnon Gallery, and at the Watsonville Public Library, where he displayed his large-scale, site-specific work on its exterior walls. A double major at UC Santa Cruz, Ramirez earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in both Fine Arts and Sociology. Since 2016, he has served as a board member of the Santa Cruz Art League.</span></p>
<p><span>Alumna <strong>Ann Altstatt</strong> is an interdisciplinary artist whose work explores geologic and non-linear time, the intersections of scientific inquiry and mysticism, and the hidden stories of everyday objects. Altstatt graduated from the Digital Arts and New Media MFA program at UCSC in 2018 and additionally, has undergraduate degrees in art and geology, plus a graduate certificate in science illustration. Altstatt has participated in numerous regional shows, including Earth/Science/Art in 2012, the 2015 Ebb and Flow River Arts Festival, and Indexical&#8217;s Melt Me into the Ocean in 2018, and has been a founding collective member at The F&#225;brica since 2010.<br/> </span></p>
<p><span>Over several decades of his art career, multi-disciplinary artist <strong>Marc D&#8217;Estout</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160; </span>has transitioned from a conceptual-based installation artist to a maker of odd objects steeped in metaphor. He has maintained both curatorial and design practices and worked in arts education. Most recently, D&#8217;Estout was curator at the Museum of Craft and Design in San Francisco. Additionally, he has served as Director for Art and Design for UCSC Extension, and as curator and exhibit designer for the Monterey Museum of Art and Triton Museum of Art. His work has shown at museums and galleries nationwide.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="56f173048072701763b3cba629150f5a"><name>dana-byrne-student-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Dana Byrne</title><summary>Dana Byrne is the kind of person who likes to get answers.

So it was a natural fit for her to gravitate to chemistry as a field of study.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m a curious person,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always asked questions, and I want to know why things work the way they do.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 21-year-old from San Jose has distinguished herself by making the Dean&#8217;s List for numerous quarters and maintaining an impressive 3.9 GPA. But she explains that she has good grades because she is an extremely hard worker in her classes.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m being rewarded for it here,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science has been a part of her life for as long as she can remember. Both her parents are engineers and she comes from a big family of scientists on her mother&#8217;s side.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At UC Santa Cruz, she has been fortunate to work in chemistry faculty member Yat Li&#8217;s lab on a research project developing 3D-printed nanomaterials for energy storage devices. Byrne explained that her work consists of the synthesis, 3D printing, and testing of carbon-based electrodes for supercapacitors, known for their high-power density but typically lacking the long-term compact energy storage that can be provided by batteries. She is one of the few undergraduates who has been able to do this kind of work.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have certainly developed a very high regard for Dana&#8217;s outstanding contributions to the lab research and her great potential as a scientist and teacher,&#8221; Li said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Byrne said she did the &#8220;dirty work&#8221; of testing and calculation while the graduate students in the lab did their own lab work. But she said she learned a lot.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The experience is totally invaluable&#8212;way better than I could have asked for,&#8221; Byrne said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Byrne plans to pursue graduate study in chemistry at UC Berkeley this fall with the goal of earning a Ph.D. in five years. She is interested in optimizing materials to produce better technology and ultimately aims to work for a tech company.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While she loves the Bay Area and would prefer to remain, she anticipates that that may be difficult because the area is so expensive. She thinks she may end up some day in Seattle or Texas to join booming tech companies there. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="56f8c6af8072701763b3cba6dbba249c"><name>sandra-nair-student-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sandra Nair </title><summary>The 21-year-old from Kerala, India, is graduating with a double major in physics and mathematics, she speaks four languages, she has won numerous awards, and—oh, yes, she’s a published author of science-fiction novels. </summary><start-date>1590562800000</start-date><display-name>Sandra Nair</display-name><path>/2020/05/sandra-nair-student-profile</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/05/sandra-nair-student-profile</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1590597043860</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1590616621653</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>commencement</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Lisa Renner</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/sandra-nair.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/sandra-nair.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sandra-nair.jpg</name><file-size>17617</file-size><width>324</width><height>324</height></image><image-alt>Sandra Nair</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/sandra-nair-thumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/sandra-nair-thumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sandra-nair-thumbnail.jpg</name><file-size>2417</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Sandra Nair</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Sandra Nair (Crown &#8217;20, mathematics and physics)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Crown ’20, mathematics and physics</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning about Sandra Nair&#8217;s accomplishments is a humbling experience.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 21-year-old from Kerala, India, is graduating with a double major in physics and mathematics, she speaks four languages, she has won numerous awards, and&#8212;oh, yes, she&#8217;s a published author of science-fiction novels.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also cares deeply about creating a more equitable world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;An advantage of being in UC Santa Cruz is I got exposed to issues facing minorities in STEM,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It struck a chord. If we are to survive as a human race as a whole, we need to look for a sustainable lifestyle that provides opportunities for all. We can&#8217;t have some parts of humanity be more important than others.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is concerned about the lack of representation of women and minorities in STEM, noting that it&#8217;s difficult to find them in academia. Even at UC Santa Cruz, there is only one female senior faculty member in the mathematics department, she points out.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of my dreams is that I could become a role model for young girls in developing nations,&#8221; she said. Since 2016, she has been a member of Milaan, a nonprofit international organization mostly based in India that works toward grassroots-level development of socially marginalized young girls and women by empowering them with education.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nair said she fell in love with science and math in high school. She remembers spending free time in the library getting &#8220;caught up in a vortex of mathematical texts.&#8221; While she didn&#8217;t understand a word, she knew she wanted to reach the level where she could.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hero of hers is the late Maryam Mirzakhani, the first woman to win the prestigious Fields Medal in 2014. Nair also deeply admires Emmy Noether, a Jewish mathematician who was expelled from teaching at a university in Germany by the Nazis, hailed by Einstein as the &#8220;most important woman in mathematics&#8221; for her immense contributions to modern abstract algebra.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Nair became the first Templeton-Ramanujan Fellowship recipient from India, receiving a $5,000 grant that she used to do research at Stanford University. She also received the J. W. T. Youngs Memorial Undergraduate Award in Mathematics, and the Ronald H. Ruby Award in Physics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, she won a Kenneth and Ann Thimann Scholarship for seniors starting grad school with aspirations and research plans in fundamental sciences, and an Honorable Mention for the Coha-Gunderson Prize in Speculative Futures organized by the UC Santa Cruz Humanities Institute.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nair will be joining the mathematics Ph.D. program at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in the fall and hopes to eventually become a mathematician specializing in algebraic geometry. She would like to become a researcher and professor; be involved in teaching; and get more women, people of color, and queer people into math.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s important for visibility,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I was lucky enough to find incredible mentors who believed in me when I doubted myself. I hope to pass that along.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She especially expressed her deep gratitude toward her mathematics undergraduate thesis advisor, Professor Junecue Suh, for inspiring and supporting her.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="56fdc5e08072701763b3cba621c9cee8"><name>nitin-vidyasagar-student-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Nitin Vidyasagar </title><summary>Nitin Vidyasagar is looking forward to graduation and a new position in a cell biology lab.

Over the next two years, he will assist UC Berkeley Assistant Professor Samantha Lewis in exploring mechanisms cells use to maintain mitochondrial DNA.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deep dive into genetics will give Vidyasagar experience and time to decide between a career in research or in medicine&#8212;fields he was introduced to during his time at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his first year on campus, Vidyasagar thought he might major in literature, but STEM courses were also exciting.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Susan Strome&#8217;s genetics class was what sold me on biology,&#8221; Vidyasagar says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He became an undergraduate researcher in Assistant Professor Joshua Arribere&#8217;s lab, studying how cells ensure quality control during gene expression.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have all these intricate microscopic events that our cells fine-tune and regulate,&#8221; Vidyasagar says. &#8220;What attracts me is exploring these beautiful and innate processes that we take for granted.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the rigor of performing research, the experience has been &#8220;wonderful.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s intimidating but you learn robust knowledge and techniques,&#8221; Vidyasagar says. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Arribere Lab gave me a safe and supportive space to learn what it meant to be a scientist and wrestle with complex concepts.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It feels like your mentors are there every step of the way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In sophomore year, Vidyasagar became an HIV peer test counselor at the Student Health Outreach and Promotion program. Over the next three years he organized events to promote and destigmatize HIV testing, especially focusing on disparities in HIV treatment for Latinx and African, black, and Caribbean-identified students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a senior, he led a project to establish a new testing site that was more accessible to students on the west side of campus. Vidyasagar says getting to help fellow students through empathy and listening is why he is interested in a possible medical career.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is excited to build on the knowledge he has obtained at UC Santa Cruz, and the Ph.D. or M.D. he aims to achieve will be a tool he can use to promote diversity and increase LGBTQIA representation in STEM fields.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Pursuing those degrees will equip me with tools to further our understanding of cellular processes and physiology,&#8221; Vidyasagar says. &#8220;They also mean more ability to enact change from within and meet the needs of our community.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5704b99e8072701763b3cba6f44694d5"><name>diego-alonzo-martinez-mori-student-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Diego Alonzo Martinez Mori</title><summary>When he was a child in Peru, Diego Alonzo Martinez Mori’s mother would sometimes bring him to the medical office where she was a secretary.

Seeing the doctors in their white coats helping people, it looked like something he&#8217;d like to do when he grew up. Now on the verge of his graduation from UC Santa Cruz, Mori is looking down the path that will take him to that vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His family moved to the Bay Area when Mori was 6, and he found a new reason to want to be a doctor: In the U.S. he didn&#8217;t meet a single Latinx or Spanish-speaking doctor. Following graduation, he will take a position as a technician at an immunology lab at Stanford. It&#8217;s a step in a plan that stretches years into the future, through medical school and doctoral study&#8212;ultimately he aims to be an M.D. Ph.D.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things came together for Mori when he came to UC Santa Cruz. The welcoming campus was where his status as a DACA recipient changed from a source of anxiety to something he might say about himself when he met fellow students (he recently gained legal residency).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s STEM Diversity program, he found his chosen career. The program enabled him to attend conferences of the Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science, where he first met scientists who looked like him.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sometimes you can give people inspiration when they didn&#8217;t know they were looking for it,&#8221; Mori said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He hopes one day to provide the same kind of inspiration to future students from underrepresented backgrounds.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encouraged by STEM Diversity Program Director Yuliana Ortega to become part of the solution to the underrepresentation of Latinx people in science and medicine, Mori plunged into opportunities to contribute to relevant research.</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a big change for San Jose resident Minh Anh Nguyen to move across the country to New Jersey last summer for an internship with defense contractor Lockheed Martin.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She struggled to adjust to the new location, meet people, and adapt to the demands of the assignment, which included updating software in a confidential pilot program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But because of her experience she was able to land a job working with the C programming language at Lockheed Martin&#8217;s Sunnyvale location. The new position starts in August.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel lucky,&#8221; she said, adding that she learned last fall that she would get the job. &#8220;I feel very relieved. I don&#8217;t have to be searching on the job market. I don&#8217;t have to stress over that.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nguyen is grateful that UC Santa Cruz and the Baskin School of Engineering opened doors for her to meet people who could help her on the way to building a career.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 21-year-old landed on computer science as a field of study in a roundabout way. She knew she didn&#8217;t want to study chemistry or biology and was wavering between accounting or computer science. But when she took a few computer science classes, she was hooked because she liked how it involved problem-solving with a group.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel like if I&#8217;m stuck, I can talk it out with someone else,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She applied for the Chancellor&#8217;s Undergraduate Internship Program as a freshman but wasn&#8217;t accepted. She was going to give up on the idea until her adviser encouraged her to try again. When she finally did get accepted, it was a huge boost to her confidence. She ended up working as a peer mentor helping with community building for the University of California MESA Engineering Program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nguyen said it wasn&#8217;t always easy being one of the few women in her computer science courses. She appreciated the support she got from groups to promote women in STEM like </span><a href="https://rewritingthecode.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rewriting the Code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.builtbygirls.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Built by Girls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is Nguyen the only person in her family to pursue a career in computer science&#8212;she also holds the distinction of another first.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m the first to go to college in my family,&#8221; she said. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5711f6b18072701763b3cba60d6aae75"><name>sergio-mendez-vargo-student-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sergio Mendez Vargo</title><summary>Sergio Mendez Vargo always knew he wanted to be in the sciences but wasn’t sure what branch. &#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chemistry was his first topic that came easy so he thought he would study to be a chemist when he enrolled in Palomar College in San Marcos in San Diego County. But then he took a physics class and really liked it. In the course, he studied electricity and magnetism and did experiments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His last semester in community college, he took a class in materials engineering and another in electrical engineering. As he prepared to transfer to a university, he applied to some schools for materials engineering and others for electrical engineering. He was delighted when UC Santa Cruz accepted him in its electrical engineering program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a journey he never could have predicted.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Three years ago, I never even considered electrical engineering,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mendez Vargo, 23, grew up in Spain with an American mother and a Spanish father. Once Mendez Vargo finished high school, his whole family decided to move to California, where his mother was raised. Though he had learned English from his mother and school, it was a bit of shock for him to learn that he and his family had a rather thick Spanish accent.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For us, we were so American!&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has enjoyed his experiences at UC Santa Cruz and his affiliation with Rachel Carson College. Though as a transfer student, he didn&#8217;t live at the college, he did resonate with Carson&#8217;s message of &#8220;pushing for a more sustainable future that includes the well-being of our environment in our decision-making.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also enjoyed participating in a UC Santa Cruz study-abroad program in Brazil. After taking a year of Portuguese language classes, he visited the country in 2018, taking computer and electrical engineering related courses there while continuing to improve his language skills.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though initially he thought he would enter the workforce right after getting his degree, he has decided to pursue a Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He came to that decision after working as an intern at Analog Devices, a tech company in Santa Clara, last summer and seeing that most of the people he worked with had doctoral degrees.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The field has developed so much in the last 50 years that in order to keep pushing technology a step further, you want to have four more years of study and research,&#8221; he said. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="574507578072701763b3cba65d3a7a94"><name>zoom-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Zoom Update - Please Review</title><summary>Beginning May 30, Zoom meetings will require version Zoom 5.0 or newer.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was shocked when they offered me a job,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I was floored. I couldn&#8217;t believe I was worth that much."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 39-year-old Modesto resident and mother of three said it has been a long road to get her to this point, in part because a decade ago, she was in and out of jail for substance abuse offenses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, she attended Modesto Junior College for three years and then she spent four years at UC Santa Cruz's Baskin School of Engineering before earning her degree. She struggled with learning disabilities and had to repeat classes and not take too many units at a time. While some other students loaded up with 19 units a quarter, she knew 10 units was tops for her.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had to leave her children (ages 19, 15, and 13) with her mother in Modesto so that she could concentrate on her studies full time at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At one point, I was leaving them to go to jail,&#8221; she said, when asked how she did it. &#8220;That wasn&#8217;t going to change unless I did something major. This time, it was to get an education.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She credits UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s many support organizations for helping her make it through and encouraging her when she hit challenges. Among those were the Smith Society (for former foster youth and others who lack traditional family support), and the MESA Engineering Program, also known as the Multicultural Engineering Program (to promote diversity in STEM).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, she thought she was going to go into robotics but she changed her mind because she didn&#8217;t like physics, which is a big part of the field. She switched to computer science but didn&#8217;t really like coding either. Then she realized she could do other things in tech such as help angel investors pick their next project or do an economic feasibility study on startups.

San Antonio College, a community college in Walnut, Calif., when the 2016 election happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I had to really think about my community,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and how to make things better for people in terms of the injustices we face.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He changed his major from pre-med to politics.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was a super scary decision,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, as Garcia graduates, the 23-year-old said he knows he made the right choice. He is looking forward to going to grad school and having a career in education, either as a professor or directing a program that provides equal opportunities for students no matter who they are or where they came from.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I just love helping people,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up in Southern California as an undocumented student, Garcia said high school counselors told him there weren&#8217;t many higher education opportunities or resources for students in his situation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They said it was better to work at McDonald's, and I almost accepted it,&#8221; said Garcia.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, he got a scholarship aimed at students who fell under the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which was set up by former President Barack Obama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And that solidified it for me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I knew I had to first create opportunities for myself and then help others.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garcia said he was captivated by the peace and natural beauty of UC Santa Cruz but, without his regular support system, he found himself wanting to connect with others who shared his experiences. His first quarter on campus, he said, he helped found an organization called Beyond Dreams, which became a space where undocumented students could gather, socialize, and share their life stories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also became a peer mentor for Services for Transfer and Re-Entry Students (STARS) at UC Santa Cruz, helping students find jobs, navigate the academic system, and adjust to university life. His senior year, he said, he had a caseload of 23 students and also had reached out to a number of students at Mt. San Antonio College telling them about the benefits and opportunities at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I really want to let people know that UC Santa Cruz is a real gem,&#8221; he said. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5773c9e68072701763b3cba659396091"><name>felix-vasquez-student-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Felix Vazquez</title><summary>If Felix Vazquez had to title his four years at UC Santa Cruz, he said they would be called, “A Series of Fortunate Events.”</summary><start-date>1590562800000</start-date><display-name>Felix Vazquez</display-name><path>/2020/05/felix-vasquez-student-profile</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/05/felix-vasquez-student-profile</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1590605105611</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1590616754389</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>commencement</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/vasquez-felix-by-carolyn.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/vasquez-felix-by-carolyn.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>vasquez-felix-by-carolyn.jpg</name><file-size>40445</file-size><width>324</width><height>324</height></image><image-alt>Felix Vazquez</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/felix-vasquez-thumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/felix-vasquez-thumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>felix-vasquez-thumbnail.jpg</name><file-size>17882</file-size><width>324</width><height>324</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Felix Vazquez</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Felix Vazquez (Oakes '20, environmental studies).

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After losing his father to cancer at 17, the Santa Monica High School grad said he came to the university feeling a bit lost. But, hearing about a class on Geographical Information System (GIS) technology taught by Barry Nickel, director of the Center for Integrated Spatial Research, he decided to investigate. Soon, Vazquez was hooked on the technology that allows its users to capture and analyze spatial and geographic data in new ways.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, because he liked history, the environmental studies major also signed up for a course about WWII memories taught by Associate Professor of Humanities and Cowell Provost Alan Christy and found himself involved in Christy&#8217;s Okinawa Memories Initiative. It wasn&#8217;t long before Vazquez was on the Pacific island of Okinawa using his new GIS skills to research noise pollution from military bases there.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, armed with $10,000 in grant monies, the Oakes College student went to Tokyo to do research for two months and fell in love with the city&#8217;s dense, fast-paced energy and its accessibility&#8212;so different from the sprawl of LA where he had grown up.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My late father was an architect,&#8221; Vazquez said of his dad, who was born in Uruguay, &#8220;and he did a lot of work in the U.S. and in Japan and so I always had a personal connection to the city&#8221; of Tokyo.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There, Vazquez used his GIS skills to look at urban development. Combining GIS with Google Street View and Google Earth Virtual Reality, he examined urban design elements like street and sidewalk widths, land-use patterns, and even maps of fires in the area to analyze the pace of development and sprawl in the city of 9.2 million people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vazquez had found his path.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, he also became a lead environmental studies peer advisor for three years, an academic tutor, a teaching assistant, and even authored a weekly newsletter for the Environmental Studies Department. His goal is to either work for an urban design firm or go to graduate school and a career in academia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Being at UCSC made me reframe how I viewed a lot of life,&#8221; Vazquez, 22, said. &#8220;There are so many things out of your control and that&#8217;s why I focused on doing as much as I could. I just kind of said yes to a lot of things. If you reach out, you never know what is going to happen.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="57c02f588072701763b3cba649ea9390"><name>sab-elections-leadership-town-hall-update-and-more</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>SAB elections, leadership town hall update, news about Thumbs Up Awards</title><summary>We have a lot of updates for our campus community in this announcement.

"The reality is that the problems&#160;are cascading on people that were already vulnerable, economies that were already failing, and to get out of this mess we need good leadership and funds, which are absent at the federal level."

In addition to experiencing higher rates of COVID-19 infection and death, the most vulnerable among us are losing ground in schooling, learning, and development, according to Azmitia and the coauthors of a new policy brief aimed at lawmakers.</p>
<p>Last fall, Azmitia responded to a call to participate in a "rapid response" network to brief legislators on issues related to families, children, adolescents, and communities. Initially convened to address the impacts of deportation and immigrant detention policies, the group pivoted to incorporate the challenges posed by the <a href="https://www.research2policy.org/coronavirus">pandemic</a>. The latest of eight short policy briefs, "<a href="https://www.research2policy.org/covid19-mitigating-implications-8">Mitigating the Implications of Coronavirus Pandemic on Families</a>," has just been published.</p>
<p>"I saw this as a chance to work with other scholars who were trying to influence federal and state policies that were increasing the vulnerabilities of essential worker families and people of color," said Azmitia, a member of the steering committee of the Latinx Caucus of the Society for Research in Child Development (SRCD). "I especially wanted to do something to try to make a difference for everyday people."</p>
<p>Concerned with how the crisis might increase the "opportunity gap" between low-income and middle- and upper-income students and families, Azmitia dug into the academic literature, followed the news, and provided feedback on drafts of the briefs, which were published every three weeks over the past few months. She helped write the last brief, which is focused on families.</p>
<p>"Gaps in performance have widened during the pandemic, so teachers will have a tremendous job in fall to bring kids up to speed," said Azmitia. "There are already summer losses in learning; now they have been compounded by winter and spring losses."</p>
<p>The pace of the outbreak left schools and universities struggling to meet the challenge of remote teaching as schools and campuses closed from coast to coast.</p>
<p>As the authors of the policy brief wrote, "The emergence of COVID-19 is not just a reminder of the digital divide in our community; it also highlights the inequities in accessing technology and online educational resources. School closures have disproportionately affected rural and ethnic minority families, placing these youths&#8217; futures at risk."</p>
<p>Although some communities, including Santa Cruz, distributed laptops to students, that didn't ensure that students could learn, noted Azmitia. "Not all students, or teachers, have access to reliable internet or devices," she said.&#160;"Students with learning differences or whose parents don't have much schooling have been especially affected. Overall, students dislike distance learning, and motivation has declined."</p>
<p>Among the recommendations included in the policy brief are providing tech support to students who are learning remotely, extending free "hotspots" that provide internet access, leveraging public libraries to help with remote education, supporting students with disabilities and learning differences, and prioritizing closing the "learning gap" when the pandemic subsides.</p>
<p>School closures and shelter-in-place orders are having additional impacts, Azmitia noted: "Families aren't used to spending so much time together and are more irritable, so another scary issue is that domestic abuse has increased."</p>
<p>The pandemic's effects are overwhelming, she said.</p>
<p>"I fear that the gains that people living in poverty and their children have made in the last decades are being erased by school closures, loss of employment, food insecurity, and homelessness," she said. "The reality is that the problems&#160;are cascading on people that were already vulnerable, economies that were already failing, and to get out of this mess we need good leadership and funds, which are absent at the federal level."</p>
<p><em><u>Community-building during the pandemic</u></em></p>
<p>Closer to home, Azmitia is seeing some of the educational challenges play out in her "Adolescent Development" course this quarter, a large class with more than 150 students.</p>
<p>Many of her students are struggling and trying to learn in difficult circumstances. "They had to unexpectedly return home, and for several of my students, a closet or a bathroom is the only place where they have quiet space," she said, adding that "internet woes" abound, particularly for those who share space with other students who have classes at the same time.&#160;Attendance is below normal, students' capacity to focus is strained during Zoom lectures, and students are missing deadlines, despite repeated reminders, she said.</p>
<p>"I have gotten a lot of emails from students who are anxious or depressed or providing significant care to siblings or parents, or grandparents, who are ill," said Azmitia. &#160;</p>
<p>At the same time, Azmitia is hearing about creative problem solving. Students have found that learning in their cars near places that have good wi-fi, like McDonald's, is a good strategy. She is also seeing students help each other during lectures by providing resources and explanations in chat boxes, and the tone of students' emails to her and her teaching assistant are more polite than usual. "They ask how we are and share their challenges," she said, adding that some come to Zoom office hours just to chat for a few minutes and let her know how they are doing.</p>
<p>"So there is a sense of caring for each other that I only experience in my smaller senior seminar or graduate classes," she said. "In general,&#160;I think we are coping by being compassionate and caring, and students are coping by being honest and humble with their requests."</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These were challenges, she said, but more importantly they are the source of her strength and her focus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I knew that I had to make every personal sacrifice, and the sacrifices that my parents went through, count,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez-Anleu has packed a lot into her four years at UC Santa Cruz. Besides her B.A., she is completing minors in Latin American and Latino studies and history of consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her second year, she studied contemporary curatorial practices at the University of Cape Town in South Africa and engaged with different methods of studying art history at UCLA. She also interned at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; and The Broad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These experiences starkly illustrated how limiting the traditional art world can be, and she has dedicated her efforts to bring underrepresented artists from communities of color to the forefront.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I do this in hopes that by seeing art that engages with their identity, communities of color and queer communities of color will arrive at an understanding that art and careers in the arts is not something that is inaccessible to them," Lopez-Anleu said. &#8220;Those were all sentiments that I felt growing up in a household and community where a relationship to art did not exist.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She curated and organized &#8220;The Beat Within,&#8221; an exhibition of drawings and poems by incarcerated youths, and continues to help with the programming of "Solitary Garden"&#8212;a participatory public sculpture and garden project on campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez-Anleu said her UCSC experience &#8220;has been marked by passionate departments full of strong and dedicated faculty who really support undergraduates and encourage us to pursue any opportunity.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I emphasize this,&#8221; she said, &#8220;because being a first-generation, queer, Central American student,&#160; having a supportive environment as I navigated higher education and its stressors has been a key aspect to my success.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her four years, Lopez-Anleu has made a point to help other students as a member of the Arts Division student advisory board. The board spearheaded the History of Art and Visual Culture Mentor/Mentee program that offers guidance to students as they begin the major. She was also the curatorial intern for UCSC&#8217;s Institute of the Arts and Sciences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knows that graduating in the midst of a pandemic won&#8217;t be easy, but soon she will begin as a curatorial and program assistant at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions to assist with an exhibition that brings together artworks examining violence generated from physical and conceptual borders and severe immigrant policies.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="581baac08072701763b3cba660a073c0"><name>raynier-ramos-student-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Raynier Ramos</title><summary>After four years, the honors student with a double major in legal studies and history of art and visual culture (HAVC) is back in San Diego now where he plans to attend law school in the fall. &#13;

After four years, the honors student with a double major in legal studies and history of art and visual culture (HAVC) is back in San Diego now where he plans to attend law school in the fall.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramos noted the redwoods when he described UCSC&#8217;s uniqueness.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The environment is completely different from any other UC campus,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The college system has the intimacy of different communities rather than one giant campus.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His RA at College Nine was vice president of Student Life and encouraged the floor to get involved in civic engagement.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s where it really began,&#8221; Ramos said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And get involved, he did. He joined the college senate, was elected president his second year, served as a senator for two years after that, and ran for president of the campuswide Student Union Assembly but was ultimately unsuccessful. He was also a member of Phi Alpha Delta, the pre-law fraternity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s not all. He also found time to be an HAVC mentor and student advisory board member for the HAVC department chair, and he took part in the UC Center Sacramento Program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law school was on his mind from the start, but there was also this love of art that stemmed from an AP history class in high school.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I really fell in love with the course, learning to analyze art rather than just seeing a painting on a wall,&#8221; Ramos said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramos notes the different writing styles of the two majors.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For one thing, it definitely improved my writing skills. Art history allows me to be more creative, allows me to go beyond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My four years at UCSC have been some of the most valuable years of my life,&#8221; Ramos said, &#8220;not just academically&#8212;I learned a lot from my peers and who I am as a person, as well. It allowed me to evolve as a person.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He will be studying law at the University of San Diego this fall.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hopefully," he said, "in person.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="582cdbd28072701763b3cba62318e7b8"><name>joyce-lin-student-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Joyce Lin </title><summary>Joyce Lin designs whimsical and inclusive games—queer games Lin lovingly calls “gaymes.”</summary><start-date>1590562800000</start-date><display-name>Joyce Lin </display-name><path>/2020/05/joyce-lin-student-profile</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/05/joyce-lin-student-profile</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1590617234354</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1590617234354</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>commencement</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/joyce-lin.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/joyce-lin.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>joyce-lin.jpg</name><file-size>59776</file-size><width>324</width><height>324</height></image><image-alt>Joyce Lin </image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/joyce-lin-thumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/joyce-lin-thumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>joyce-lin-thumbnail.jpg</name><file-size>2391</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Joyce Lin </image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Joyce Lin (<span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter &#8216;20, art &amp; design: games &amp; playable media)</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Porter ‘20, art &amp; design: games &amp; playable media</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joyce Lin designs whimsical and inclusive games&#8212;queer games Lin lovingly calls &#8220;gaymes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not just in the sense of representing queer &#8216;folx&#8217; in characters or stories, but also in valuing queerness,&#8221; said Lin, who prefers &#8220;they&#8221; and &#8220;their&#8221; as pronouns. &#8220;I was introduced to queer game theory here, which has been instrumental in inspiring much of my work so far.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin, who grew up in the East Bay, chose games &amp; playable media for its &#8220;good balance between learning art and programming. I liked that there were many different roles you could choose; I like wearing many hats. I also liked that it is a creative field.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz experience has &#8220;broadened my horizons of what games can be: Designers can create games with certain emotions in mind for the player, and games can help create social change. As for emotions, I seek to create games that evoke whimsy, wonder, and catharsis.&#8221; (See </span><a href="https://jellolin2.carbonmade.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin's portfolio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://jellolin.itch.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last October, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included Lin in &#8220;</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/16/technology/game-developers.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fear, Anxiety and Hope: What It Means to Be a Minority in Gaming</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; that highlights their game &#8220;Queering Spacetime,&#8221; a dating sim card game where players role-play girls who have crushes on each other and create dates.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another game, &#8220;dinosaurily,&#8221; is about found family where a dinosaur finds and hugs other dinosaurs, which then follow the first dinosaur around. It has a pastel vaporwave-esque collage aesthetic and players can place neon stickers, plant flowers, and dance.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin has won a scholarship from the International Game Developers Association to the Game Developer&#8217;s Conference in San Francisco and a Koret Foundation Scholarship for research and development of &#8220;Queering Spacetime.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel like I&#8217;ve found my people,&#8221; Lin said. &#8220;I want to design in a way that conveys shared values or maybe new values, ones that say if we work together we can create a better, kinder, more inclusive future for all of us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin said they are grateful for their experience at UCSC &#8220;because it allowed me to expand my horizons and meet wonderful people.&#160;&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was wrong, in the best way possible,&#8221; she said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, it was the natural beauty and the presence of smart, ambitious friends who led her to the campus. But Avila-Breach&#8217;s intellectual curiosity and adventurous spirit led to unexpected opportunities that shaped the rest of her time at UCSC and influenced her professional goals.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After taking a course in applied ethics, Avila-Breach joined the Ethics Bowl team, a non confrontational alternative to the traditional competitive form of debate. In 2018, she was part of an Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl team that squared off against a group of San Quentin prison inmates in a friendly and spirited debate that was more about finding common ground than "winning" or "losing."</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The topic was &#8220;disproportionate disenfranchisement of African Americans as one symptom of a biased criminal justice system,&#8221; and Avila-Breach had a memorable rebuttal that was quoted in the San Quentin News: &#8220;Considering broader racial inequities, where is the justice here?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her politics and philosophy professors urged Avila-Breach to take the next step. She joined the research center for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Human Rights Lab, and worked as the team manager. This project uses high-tech sleuthing tools to investigate human rights abuses across the globe. The Humanities Institute funded her participation in the lab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that she is on the verge of graduation, and hoping to attend law school, Avila-Breach looks back on her time at UC Santa Cruz with fondness and gratitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To all future UC Santa Cruz students I say welcome, and remember that beside the classes and degree, there is an academic world and community right at your fingertips,&#8221; she said, before leaving the next generation of Slug scholars with a one-word call to action: &#8220;Engage!&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="58338fb48072701763b3cba6248ec8bb"><name>zaire-armstrong-student-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Zaire Armstrong</title><summary>Zaire Armstrong, 22,  is this year’s winner of the David A.

Kadish Humanities Scholarship Award, which recognizes deserving students with a strong interest in the study of humanities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This scholarship is generously funded through gift funds from Cowell alumnus David Kadish (history '73).&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armstrong&#8217;s study of philosophy&#8212;and, in particular, existentialism&#8212;helped ground and focus her studies, moving her toward a greater sense of purpose and clarity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As with many of my freshman peers, I suppose the idea that I should be at school was a lot clearer than why,&#8221; she said, referring to her early experience at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eventually philosophy came to not only captivate my attention, but contextualize my purpose for learning,&#8221; Armstrong said. &#8220;I could even go so far as to say the vastness and diversity of philosophical theories (collectively) provided me with the comfort that no one, not even the philosophers who make it their job, can really understand the &#8216;fundamental nature&#8217; of existence."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delving deeply into philosophy was a kind of awakening for her.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the infinite possibility of self-determined existentialist realities, I not only found an enthusiasm for philosophy, but also a confidence and passion for learning in general,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armstrong hopes that her courses on ethics in government can be put to use when she attends law school.&#160;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I'm keen on learning about how these theories apply and/or contradict the law, and though my goal beyond that isn't fleshed out yet, I'm sure that I'll continue to consult reflections and lessons of my time in undergrad to guide me,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="58382a488072701763b3cba6f4dcb01a"><name>max-tarlov-student-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Max Tarlov</title><summary>Max Tarlov, 21, already had his major in mind when he started out at UC Santa Cruz.

But a class called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Syntax 1</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deepened his engagement with linguistics, while helping him to develop critical thinking skills.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That course was a game changer for Tarlov, who was honored with an Undergraduate Research Fellowship for his research project entitled, &#8220;Properties of Alignment and Match Theories in Kinyambo.&#8221; His research focuses on using intonation data from a Bantu language called Kinyambo to make predictions about how intonation can work across the world&#8217;s languages.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Syntax 1</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> class, students were given problem sets three times a week and simply asked to provide an analysis of the data they were given.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The problem sets were graded on the quality of the argumentation, not correctness, because it quickly becomes clear that there is no consensus regarding the correct answer for most of these problems,&#8221; Tarlov said. &#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Syntax 1</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> taught me to think critically about linguistics, how to come to my own conclusions, and how to question my own thinking.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That class established a strong foundation for his other linguistics classes at UC Santa Cruz. He also had the opportunity to work as a research assistant on a program called SPOT (Syntax-Prosody in Optimality Theory). Through this program, he learned a lot about software development in the service of linguistics research.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His time at UC Santa Cruz has had a lasting impact.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think that when I entered the program, I wanted to be someone who knew things about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">linguistics,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but leaving the program I think of myself as someone who understands things about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">language,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">" Tarlov said. "Learning to think critically about other people's interpretations of data and thinking critically about my own interpretations of linguistic data have allowed me to understand why we conduct linguistic research and how much there still is to learn about human language.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="583b58a28072701763b3cba670600023"><name>nirupama-chandrasekhar-student-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Nirupama Chandrasekhar</title><summary>Nirupama Chandrasekhar, 21, has pursued rigorous and impactful research throughout her undergraduate career, impressing her professors with her independent work and collaborative research projects. &#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nirupama is emblematic of everything that an undergraduate can achieve at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Stephanie Sawyer, undergraduate program coordinator in the campus&#8217;s History Department.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chandrasekhar was a key member of a collaborative public history project, the Okinawa Memories Initiative (OMI), using oral history, interdisciplinary work, and digital humanities. At the end of her first year at UCSC, she was selected as the 2017&#8211;2018 OMI intern via the Chancellor&#8217;s Undergraduate Internship Program, an experience that she said, &#8220;molded my understanding of how to build a complex research project, and how to motivate my fellow students to love learning.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this time, she was also instrumental in bringing the Sesnon Gallery exhibit, &#8220;The Gail Project: An Okinawan-American Dialogue,&#8221; to fruition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following year, Chandrasekhar was selected for the 2018&#8211;2019 Koret Scholars Program. For her Koret research project, Chandrasekhar used video footage, oral histories, and mapping done during her summer trips to Okinawa with OMI to examine the ways in which death, memory, and remembrance are significant to communities on Okinawa.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chandrasekhar has served on the Humanities Division Dean's Undergraduate Council and the History Department Major Advisory Council. This year, four years of research, travel, and hard work culminated in her senior thesis research project, in which she explored and compared the effects of tourism and the military on modern Okinawa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I first came into UCSC, I was really torn and conflicted about my interests,&#8221; she said. &#8220;All my life, I&#8217;ve always wanted to do something meaningful, but I&#8217;d never been told how to do that within the humanities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;d always thought it was a very isolated process, a single academic stuck in the library, and I&#8217;ve never been suited to that form of work,&#8221; Chandrasekhar continued. &#8220;But working closely with my peers and mentors at UCSC has been such an eye-opening experience. Finding out that the best work is done in collaboration with friends and fellow-minded thinkers has opened up so many new pathways for me!&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his second year at UC Santa Cruz, the film and digital media major covered the wildfires that ravaged Napa and Sonoma counties. He remembers seeing well-known Napa Valley sites from his childhood destroyed. The fires &#8220;devastated a lot of stuff, a lot of landmarks. It kind of messes with how you think about where you&#8217;re from,&#8221; he said. Though the fires didn&#8217;t hit his home, they &#8220;affected everyone generally,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ochoa decided he wanted to pursue film in college after researching and writing a screenplay for his high school senior project. He chose UC Santa Cruz because &#8220;Santa Cruz is one of the upper-quality film programs in public schools, big on indy projects,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of COVID-19, this spring he&#8217;s been working on his thesis film without being able to get the equipment that would normally be available to him as a senior.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There's just no sanitary way to do it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s opened my eyes to what's possible with limited resources.&#8217;&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His old DSLR camera is at least better than using a phone like some of his friends, and he&#8217;s picked up a tripod and LED light.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ochoa figures some of his resourcefulness stems from hands-on experiences he had in summer and fall last year in London and Paris. He enjoyed several internships, including one with a tech start-up where he learned the nuts and bolts of fast-paced filming, schedules, timelines, interview skills, editing, and branding.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I had an amazing time,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back on campus, Ochoa has been editor-in-chief of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eyecandy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the only film and media criticism publication at UCSC. As part of the effort, he led a student-taught class on layout and writing. As a teacher and editor &#8220;you have to learn fundraising, grant writing, social media outreach.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ochoa said he had planned to move to Los Angeles after graduation but everything is on hold because of the coronavirus.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflecting on his UCSC years, Ochoa cites the resources available to students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How much you get out of a university education depends on putting in the effort to take advantage of every resource you can use," he said. "What you get out of it depends on what you put in.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="584f80898072701763b3cba62fb9b109"><name>nyereath-nhial-student-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Nyereath Nhial</title><summary>&#13;

But it would be three more years before Nhial&#8217;s mother and four older siblings were able to leave the refugee camps and join him in the West.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nhial, a 2020 UC Santa Cruz graduate who was born in San Diego County, knew her family&#8217;s saga but wanted to explore more deeply the stories of women in the deadly conflicts that had wracked South Sudan rather than the men that history usually centered on. As part of a research project, the sociology and critical race and ethnic studies major began a series of interviews with Sudanese refugee women&#8212;mothers, sisters, aunts, and grandmothers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was one of the hardest projects I&#8217;d ever embarked on,&#8221; Nhial said. &#8220;It was intellectually challenging and pushed me beyond my limits.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result was a senior seminar research project titled, South Sudanese Refugees and Youth: Complex Narratives of Gender, War and Diaspora, which was awarded the prestigious Dean&#8217;s Undergraduate Research Award in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That was a huge moment for me,&#8221; Nhial said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it wasn&#8217;t the only moment for the College Ten student who graduated from Mount Miguel High School in Spring Valley, Calif. During her four years at UC Santa Cruz, Nhial was also president of the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority on campus and was honored for having the highest GPA (4.0) of any member of the sorority in the state. She was a student mentor for the Educational Opportunity Programs on campus, worked with students at Soquel High School, and completed an internship with a youth community garden project in San Diego. In what she called a pivotal moment, she also was one of only two undergrads invited to join a graduate seminar by Assistant Professor of Critical Race and Ethnic Studies Savannah Shange.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, Nhial will be moving to Japan for at least one year to work as an assistant language teacher and a cultural ambassador with the Japan Exchange and Teaching program (JET).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I like to push my boundaries, to go out of my comfort zone,&#8221; Nhial said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She plans to continue to focus on youth, the South Sudanese diaspora, and marginalized communities in the U.S., she said, with the possibility of working in higher education someday.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5d1434c78072701763b3cba63ae6e627"><name>ohone-tiger-beetles</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Emerald predators: Ohlone tiger beetles reclaim territory with the help of local scientists</title><summary>U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists released 43 Ohlone tiger beetles to a new home in Santa Cruz County earlier this year with the help of UC Santa Cruz students and reserve managers</summary><keywords>Alex Jones</keywords><start-date>1590649200000</start-date><display-name>Ohlone tiger beetles reclaim territory with the help of local scientists</display-name><path>/2020/05/ohone-tiger-beetles</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/05/ohone-tiger-beetles</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1590699504814</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1590703756093</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Ashley McConnell (USFWS)</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/tiger-beetle-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/tiger-beetle-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tiger-beetle-400.jpg</name><display-name>tiger-beetle-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>127914</file-size><width>400</width><height>379</height></image><image-alt>tiger beetle</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/mating-vial-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/mating-vial-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mating-vial-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>mating-vial-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21372</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>tiger beetles in vial</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Adult Ohlone tiger beetles have a striking iridescent green coloring and are known to be ferocious predators.

Their metallic emerald bodies appear iridescent in the sunlight as they scurry across the bare earth. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">In the first-ever translocation of adult tiger beetles, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) biologists released 43 Ohlone tiger beetles to a new home in Santa Cruz County earlier this year with the help of UC Santa Cruz students and reserve managers, local land managers, and tiger beetle experts from across the country. The translocated beetles came from stable populations in the UCSC Campus Natural Reserve and other nearby preserves. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">The project&#8217;s goal is to establish a self-sustaining population of the rare beetles in an area of Santa Cruz County where they&#8217;ve been absent for more than a decade.</span></span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">The danger with any rare species is that any of the populations could be wiped out for any number of reasons in a given year,&#8221; explained USFWS biologist Chad Mitcham. &#8220;Its overall range would significantly decline with the loss of any one cluster.&#8221; </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">For a species whose remaining suitable habitat is estimated at 200 to 300 acres, the threat of extinction is real. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Entomologist Dick Arnold may have been the last person to see an Ohlone tiger beetle at the preserve near Soquel more than a decade ago. </span></span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Unfortunately, the habitat conditions changed over time as more and more of the areas nearby got developed,&#8221; he said. As someone who&#8217;s studied rare insects for more than 40 years, Arnold said he&#8217;s delighted at the possibility of re-establishing a population where they&#8217;ve been extinct for more than 10 years.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">A re-established population in this location, if it becomes self-sustaining, is critical for the tiger beetle&#8217;s long-term survival, explained Tara Cornelisse, a senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity who has studied the Ohlone tiger beetle for more than a decade, starting with her doctoral research at UC Santa Cruz. She helped train local resource managers to assist with the unprecedented translocation. </span></span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">It provides an insurance population for the species,&#8221; she said.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Lost populations</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Ohlone tiger beetles likely inhabited a larger area before development around Santa Cruz reduced the extent and connectivity of their habitat. Populations lost from isolated sites may not be recolonized naturally, increasing the species&#8217; overall risk of extinction. The translocation project aims to give the beetle some help.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">According to USFWS biologist Mark Ogonowski, the idea got its start in a 2016 conversation with Grey Hayes, a rangeland ecologist active in Ohlone tiger beetle conservation (who also earned his Ph.D. at UCSC). &#8220;Grey thought translocating beetles to properly managed sites where they used to occur could be successful and put us in touch with the experts who have made this project possible,&#8221; Ogonowski said.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Sixteen males and 27 females were hand-collected one-by-one using nets and vials from three locations in the county where tiger beetle populations are known to be stable. The animals were placed in ice chests and transported to the preserve, where land managers from the Center for Natural Lands Management have been working since last fall to prepare the area for its new inhabitants. The litter layer of dead grass and leaves was removed by raking, weeding, and hand-pulling vegetation to create the bare-ground habitat Ohlone tiger beetles need to survive.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">They require open, bare areas to stalk their prey, and they lay their eggs in tiny burrows in the ground. </span></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Aptly named for the Native American tribe with which they co-existed for millennia, Ohlone tiger beetles have ferocious predatory instincts. With excellent vision, they lie still on the bare ground and stealthily pounce on ants and flies that enter their line of sight.</span></span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">They&#8217;re like green jewels with jaws like the fangs of a saber tooth tiger,&#8221; Cornelisse says. &#8220;People are delighted when they see them.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">They&#8217;re also an important part of the food chain and are prey for a variety of animals, from birds and toads to lizards and dragonflies, Arnold said. &#8220;Anytime you start to lose species in a food chain, it weakens the whole system,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know how many can be lost before the whole food chain collapses.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Endangered</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">In 2001, due to habitat loss, invasive grasses, and lack of natural disturbance, the Ohlone tiger beetle was designated as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. While the designation secured protections for the beetle, proactive management and recovery efforts would be required to bring the species back from the brink.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">The beetles transferred to the site near Soquel came from Glenwood and Moore Creek Preserves and natural reserve lands on the UC Santa Cruz campus. Today, rotational livestock grazing, prescribed burns, non-native vegetation removal, and even mountain biking trails all play key roles in the survival of the Ohlone tiger beetle.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Matt Timmer, natural resource manager with the Land Trust of Santa Cruz County, manages the 200-acre Glenwood Preserve in Scotts Valley. Glenwood Preserve was established more than two decades ago to protect habitat for Ohlone tiger beetles and other rare plants and animals as mitigation from impacts of a housing development. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">At Glenwood Preserve, Ohlone tiger beetles thrive in pastures grazed by cattle. The cattle form paths that create bare ground where the tiger beetles spend most of their time as adults. </span></span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Historically, these grasslands would have consisted of perennial bunch grasses and forbs with patches of bare ground. With the arrival of European settlers, livestock, and non-native grasses, that system has changed over time,&#8221; says Timmer. &#8220;Today, we&#8217;re using grazing to try to mimic historical conditions, like the large herds of ungulates that once roamed the area, to create more suitable habitat for the beetle.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">UC Santa Cruz created two preserves on campus through a habitat conservation plan put in place to mitigate impacts to Ohlone tiger beetles and other federally protected wildlife from a faculty and staff housing development. Some of the now-preserved lands are used for academic research, grazing, and recreation, and provide much-needed habitat for Ohlone tiger beetles to carry out their life cycle.</span></span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Santa Cruz County has a lot of open space that people use and appreciate. People are already in love with this area,&#8221; said Alex Jones, who manages the UCSC Campus Natural Reserve. &#8220;We should celebrate the tiger beetle and Endangered Species Act as one of the reasons we have so much open space here in Santa Cruz. Conservation of tiger beetles has allowed for some of this open space to exist.&#8221;&#160;</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Jones recruits UCSC students to conduct Ohlone tiger beetle surveys, a source of key data to further the conservation of this species.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Wilder Ranch State Park boasts one of the more stable Ohlone tiger beetle populations in the county, a testament to successful ongoing management activities, from prescribed burns to the creation and management of mountain biking trails. If this initial translocation proves successful, additional beetles may be translocated from Wilder State Park to the preserve near Soquel to further augment the new population.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Habitat loss</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">More than 100 species of tiger beetles are known in the U.S. and Canada alone, and five of them are listed as threatened or endangered. Barry Knisley, who has been studying tiger beetles for more than 40 years, said, &#8220;Like so many organisms, there is clearly a decline. We&#8217;re losing habitat as development and urbanization and human activity progress. As we lose natural areas, we&#8217;re losing tiger beetles.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Knisley, who played a role in securing protections for several species of tiger beetle across the United States, perfected larval translocation to boost dwindling populations and consults on the Ohlone tiger beetle adult translocation project in Santa Cruz. </span></span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">There&#8217;s good evidence that larval translocation works, and now we&#8217;d like to see if adult translocation can also be successful,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We do know, unlike vertebrate animals, that tiger beetles can rebound genetically and biologically if the habitat is suitable. If we double the number of sites, we have a chance.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">The team continues to monitor the new arrivals at their new home, and early observations appear promising. In the hours and days following release, the beetles were observed hunting and mating.</span></span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">No one knew what to expect, but we knew what we wanted to see happen. Hunting and mating are exactly that,&#8221; Mitcham said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very good sign.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Mitcham and the rest of the team remain hopeful that this first-ever translocation will be the first of more to come, steps that will bring this enigmatic species one step closer to recovery. &#8220;They&#8217;re ambassadors for insect conservation and the health of the prairies, and they&#8217;re worth saving,&#8221; he said.</span></span></p>

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The award recognizes Jeltema &#8220;for her dedication to mentoring young physicists through hands-on, heartfelt, and effective engagement with diverse students at all levels, demonstrating how particle physics can be an inclusive and productive environment.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">SCIPP Director Steven Ritz said, &#8220;Tesla&#8217;s sustained dedication to mentoring is outstanding. I am grateful to have inspirational colleagues like her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Jeltema, whose research addresses cosmological questions such as the nature of dark matter and dark energy and the evolution of galaxies, founded the UCSC Women in Physics and Astrophysics (WiPA) group in 2011 and serves as its faculty adviser. WiPA was awarded a UCSC Chancellor&#8217;s Achievement Award for Diversity in 2014.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">WiPA has had a continuing, positive impact on both the Physics Department and the Astronomy and Astrophysics Department,&#8221; said Ritz, a professor of physics.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In Jeltema&#8217;s research group, both graduate students and undergraduates benefit from a supportive, collaborative environment. Over the past six years, in addition to supervising five Ph.D. students and two visiting graduate students, she was the research supervisor or senior thesis adviser for 17 undergraduate students, of which 16 were from groups underrepresented in physics. Those who applied to graduate school are all now in Ph.D. or masters programs. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Lena Eiger, who as an undergraduate worked with Jeltema on a project for the international Dark Energy Survey collaboration and is currently a junior research specialist in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, said Jeltema&#8217;s support and encouragement have been crucial to the success of many students.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">I have witnessed Prof. Jeltema change the lives of several students at UCSC,&#8221; Eiger said in a letter supporting Jeltema&#8217;s nomination for the award. &#8220;As a teacher, she is a powerful role model for women in science; as a research mentor she leads students through the thought processes needed to discern some of the universe&#8217;s most elusive secrets. Her belief in me through even the darkest times has given me a strength that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Erica Bufanda, now a graduate student at the University of Hawaii, said Jeltema taught her invaluable research skills as her senior thesis adviser and introduced her to programs that were crucial to her success as a student and scientist. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">She</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> made it possible for me to attend numerous career and higher education workshops that opened my eyes to career options and the potential of graduate school studies, and </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">through these events I</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> made connections with other under-represented faculty and students in STEM,&#8221; Bufanda said. &#8220;I truly do not believe I would be where I am today without her guidance.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Devon Hollowood, who began working with Jeltema as a first-year graduate student, said she was </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;</span></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">a fantastic mentor from day one.&#8221; Now a software engineer at Google, Hollowood said, &#8220;Professor Jeltema helped me come out of my shell in graduate school, and guided me from a bewildered first-year student to a successful software engineer. She was always excellent in her explanations, comforting about whatever problems I faced, and I always felt that she was on my side and that I could talk to her, even about difficult topics.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Jeltema is active in numerous STEM diversity efforts at UCSC, advising students in UC CAMP (California Alliance for Minority Participation), UC LEADs (Leadership Excellence through Advanced Degrees), and the Julie Packard summer research experience. She also participates in numerous workshops, panels, and talks for organizations and programs such as the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE), and the College Scholars honors program.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Jeltema was the lead co-organizer of the 2015 APS Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) at UC Santa Cruz, and she has been leading the organization of the 2021 CUWiP meeting, which was to be hosted again at UCSC but will now be held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="62267d608072701763b3cba661f4bfc7"><name>on-campus-permit-requirement-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>On-Campus Permit Requirement Update</title><summary>Effective June 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020, permit requirements for regular, non-reserved parking spaces on campus, including the Coastal Sciences Campus and the Westside Research Park facility (2300 Delaware), will continue to be temporarily suspended.</summary><start-date>1590735600000</start-date><display-name>On-Campus Permit Requirement Update</display-name><path>/2020/05/on-campus-permit-requirement-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/05/on-campus-permit-requirement-update</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1590784589118</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594758987292</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><strong>Permit Requirements On Campus</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">I write today to share our pain, sadness, and anger for the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In the midst of this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, the all too common violence and threat of violence perpetrated against Black people and other communities of color in our country escalates. George Floyd&#8217;s death is part of an appalling history of racist harassment, assault, and murder that stretches back far too long in the life of our nation. There are too many victims whose experiences never made headlines and whose names will never become public. I know that grief weighs heavily on many members of our community. I struggle with my own sense of heartbreak.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Our university struggles with and works within the same context of white supremacist systems, structures, and conditions that make life more dangerous and precarious for people of color. Universities, like our country, have taken too long to translate our ideals into action or sustainable change. Transforming the university takes work, and we are still engaged in that work. The pace of change is frustratingly slow and the instruments of change are imperfect. The difficulties of this past year for our community highlight how far we have to go.&#160;</span></span></p>
