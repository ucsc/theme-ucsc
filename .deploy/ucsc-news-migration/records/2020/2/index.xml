<p>Involving more than 1,300 scientists and clinicians from 37 countries, the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (known as PCAWG or the Pan-Cancer Project) analyzed more than 2,600 genomes of 38 different tumor types, creating a huge resource of primary cancer genomes. This was then the launch-point for 16 working groups studying multiple aspects of cancer&#8217;s development, causation, progression, and classification.</p>
<p>Previous studies focused on the 1 percent of the genome that codes for proteins. The Pan-Cancer Project explored in considerably greater detail the remaining 99 percent of the genome, including key regions that control switching genes on and off. By analogy, if the genome can be viewed as a recipe book for living cells and cancer as a process that makes changes to it, both large and small, then previous efforts looked for changes in the ingredient lists, while this new project also looks for alterations to the instructions for how those ingredients are used.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study, which provides the most complete picture to date of cancer-causing mutations in all parts of the genome, was a massive team science effort involving researchers spanning the globe,&#8221; said steering committee member Josh Stuart, the Baskin Professor of Biomolecular Engineering at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;At UC Santa Cruz, our strengths in systems biology and RNA expression helped us connect findings in the previously unexplored noncoding genome with the pathways that lead to cancer. Like a charted map, this new work creates a reference and resource that researchers can use to interpret future data and physicians can use to guide treatment.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to serving on the project&#8217;s steering committee, Stuart led a working group that focused on the biological networks and pathways affected by the genetic changes in cancer cells. Other scientists affiliated with the UCSC Genomics Institute also made important contributions to the project, including Angela Brooks, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering, Jingchun Zhu, an associate research scientist at the Genomics Institute, and graduate students David Haan and Cameron Soulette.</p>
<p><strong>Gene expression</strong></p>
<p>Brooks co-led a working group that focused on changes in gene expression revealed by sequencing the RNA molecules in cancer cells in addition to the DNA sequences that are the focus of most cancer genomics studies.</p>
<p>&#8220;RNA is the output of the genome, so RNA sequencing can help us interpret the DNA mutations identified in the whole genome sequences and gives us a more complete picture of how cancer genomes are altered,&#8221; Brooks explained. &#8220;We found that a lot of known cancer genes have alterations at the RNA level that we wouldn&#8217;t pick up just from the DNA sequence data.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Pan-Cancer Project has made available a comprehensive resource for cancer genomics research, including the raw genome sequencing data, software for cancer genome analysis, and multiple interactive websites exploring various aspects of the PCAWG data.</p>
<p>The project extended and advanced methods for analyzing cancer genomes, including cloud computing, and by applying these methods to its large dataset, discovered new knowledge about cancer biology and confirmed important findings of previous studies.</p>
<p><strong>23 papers</strong></p>
<p>In 23 papers published February 5 in <em>Nature</em> and its affiliated journals, the Pan-Cancer Project reported that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cancer genome is finite and knowable, but enormously complicated. By combining sequencing of the whole cancer genome with a suite of analysis tools, scientists can characterize every genetic change found in a cancer, all the processes that have generated those mutations, and even the order of key events during a cancer&#8217;s life history.</li>
<li>Researchers are close to cataloging all of the biological pathways involved in cancer and having a fuller picture of their actions in the genome. At least one causal mutation was found in virtually all of the cancers analyzed, and the processes that generate mutations were found to be hugely diverse, from changes in single DNA letters to the reorganization of whole chromosomes. More than a dozen regions of the genome controlling how genes switch on and off were identified as targets of cancer-causing mutations.</li>
<li>A new method can identify mutations which occurred years, sometimes even decades, before the tumor appeared. This opens, theoretically, a window of opportunity for early cancer detection.</li>
<li>Tumor types can be identified accurately according to the patterns of genetic changes seen throughout the genome, potentially aiding the diagnosis of a patient&#8217;s cancer where conventional clinical tests could not identify its type. Knowledge of the exact tumor type can help doctors tailor treatments.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;The findings we have shared with the world today are the culmination of an unparalleled, decade-long collaboration that explored the entire cancer genome,&#8221; said Dr. Lincoln Stein, a member of the project steering committee and head of adaptive oncology at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR). &#8220;With the knowledge we have gained about the origins and evolution of tumors, we can develop new tools and therapies to detect cancer earlier, develop more targeted therapies and treat patients more successfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>By analyzing the molecular aberrations in cancer cells across a broad range of tumor types, pan-cancer analysis is a powerful tool for identifying common pathways that lead to cancer. Stuart has been a pioneer of this approach, helping to organize the Pan-Cancer Initiative of <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga">The Cancer Genome Atlas</a> (TCGA) program of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes expanded this approach to include non-coding regions of the genome, using whole genome data from TCGA and the <a href="https://icgc.org/">International Cancer Genome Consortium</a> (ICGC).</p>
<p>The results provide new insights into the molecular drivers of cancer and an enormously valuable set of resources for the scientific community to advance cancer research.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very excited to see the results of this work come out, because it was such a grand challenge to come together as a global scientific community and put together these findings into a coherent story,&#8221; Stuart said.</p>

<p>"The California Penal Code hasn't been overhauled in four or five decades," said Haney, who spent two hours with committee members on Jan. 24, discussing "how we got to the point of having a vastly overcrowded prison system and <em>still</em> not meaningfully addressing crime."</p>
<p>Committee Chair Michael Romano, director and founder of the Three Strikes and Justice Advocacy Projects at Stanford Law School, invited Haney, asking him to provide an overview of the last 40 years of criminal justice history in the state. Established by Gov. Gavin Newsom, the committee includes former legislator John Burton, two current California legislators, two former judges, and UCI Law School Dean L. Song Richardson.</p>
<p>"They all know the system extremely well, and we all agreed that when somebody goes to prison, there have been multiple systemic failures," said Haney, who advocates for a much more "nuanced and humane approach" with a broader range of options that do not include incarceration. "Putting someone in jail or prison reflects a simplistic, 19th-century view of crime," he said. "We now know better and need more enlightened and scientifically supportable policies."</p>
<p>Haney, who has studied capital punishment, the criminal justice system, and the psychological impacts of incarceration for more than 40 years, has watched the prison population explode over the past four decades.</p>
<p>"I told them that when I started this work, California had 19,000 people in prison, and that seemed like a lot. Many informed experts wanted to reduce even that number," said Haney. Today, the prison population stands at 120,000.</p>
<p>Although California incarcerates at the same "extraordinarily high rate" as many other states, the scale of imprisonment is different in the Golden State, said Haney. "We have massive prisons that can hold 4,000 or more inmates, compared to much smaller facilities elsewhere," he said. Enormous prisons generate a level of anonymity and alienation that takes a toll on inmates, and the buildings themselves were built to "warehouse people," which makes them difficult to convert to other purposes, including rehabilitation, he said.</p>
<p><u>Forty years of research</u></p>
<p>Drastic changes are needed, said Haney. Forty years of experience with the criminal justice system has taught him that crime is not a simple matter of someone making "bad choices" or manifesting individual-level pathologies. Rather, a person&#8217;s traumatic life history and dire present circumstances are the real determinants of whether he or she engages in crime, with childhood maltreatment, poverty, and racism being among the top risk factors, said Haney, noting that over 90% of people in prison are poor, and the majority are people of color.</p>
<p>"We have finally come to the point where there is widespread political agreement that punitive responses must give way to crime-prevention strategies that address these root causes," said Haney. "Criminal justice reform must integrate existing research as a basis for reducing prison populations."</p>
<p>Increased awareness of the impact of poverty and economic inequality needs to be understood as an issue of crime-prevention, as well as social justice, he said, adding "Crime and poverty are inextricably linked, and people at risk of being locked out of the economic system are at risk of being permanently locked into the criminal justice system."</p>
<p><u>"There really is a prison industrial complex"</u></p>
<p>Like many other states, California responded to increases in crime levels in the 1970s by embracing a host of draconian policies that drove up the number of people in prison, Haney told the committee. "We could've responded differently, by addressing the causes of crime, but we didn't," he said.</p>
<p>There were also large economic incentives for prison construction in California and other states, and the political and economic forces "fed off each other" as whole industries grew up around the boom in prison construction, he said. "There really is a prison industrial complex," said Haney. "In addition to all of the security hardware that has been introduced into corrections, there are telephone, food service, and other kinds of companies that <em>primarily </em>service prisons. There are even televisions made just for people in prison."</p>
<p>After Haney's presentation, the committee members asked him for his unfiltered vision of what a more just criminal justice system would look like. Haney acknowledged the need for "massive, fundamental change."</p>
<p>Among the most important reforms, Haney would like to see drastic reductions in how many people go to prison and for how long, as well as significant changes in the legal process by which sentences are decided. &#8220;Defendants&#8217; life circumstances should be considered when their liberty is at stake&#8212;something currently allowed only in death-penalty cases, where defense attorneys present their client's "social history" for consideration during the penalty phase of the trial.</p>
<p>In addition to a shift toward a more &#8220;human services&#8221; orientation for police, which he admits would require new training and additional resources, Haney wants to overhaul the way prisons operate&#8212;and his vision has already gained traction in Oregon and elsewhere. For five years, Haney and Brie Williams, his collaborator at UCSF, have partnered to take U.S. corrections officers and officials to Norway, where they are trained in a wholly different approach to corrections. Oregon prison officials subsequently transformed that state's entire prison system, based in large part on what they learned in their Norway experience with Williams and Haney.</p>
<p>As Haney said, "In Norway, prisons operate on what they call the 'principle of normality,' recognizing that virtually everyone who goes in is eventually going to come out, so they try to make incarceration as much like normal life as possible.&#8221; But, he added, "I think they intuitively operate with one even more basic principle, one that the U.S. is only now grasping, the &#8216;principle of humanity.&#8217; The Norwegians understand that no matter what someone has done, they retain their essential humanity and they need to be treated and responded to as a human being."</p>
<p>For too long in this country, he said, our media-driven society has viewed people who engage in criminal behavior as "evil, as monsters. We have learned to regard the perpetrators of crime as otherworldly beings who are not wired like everybody else."</p>
<p>But his decades of experience have taught Haney a different lesson, one that many U.S. policy-makers seem poised to appreciate: &#8220;Persons who engage in crime are different from you and me only in the lives they have lived and the circumstances in which they have acted, and both are things over which they often have relatively little control.&#8221;</p>
<p>"California now has a real opportunity to do things differently, to make changes that were unimaginable just a decade ago," he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="113cb34880727017465caccee43650bc"><name>news-sports-slug</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community input key for new Athletics and Recreation Banana Slug</title><start-date>1580803200000</start-date><display-name>Athletics and Recreation Slug logo</display-name><path>/2020/02/news-sports-slug</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/02/news-sports-slug</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1580837155624</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1580837155624</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Weekly Keynote</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Sue Harriman</name><title>Director, Athletics and Recreation</title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/02/images/sue-harriman-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/02/images/sue-harriman-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sue-harriman-500px.jpg</name><display-name>sue-harriman-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>53056</file-size><width>500</width><height>301</height></image><image-alt>Sue Harriman</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/02/images/new-slug-300px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/02/images/new-slug-300px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>new-slug-300px.jpg</name><display-name>new-slug-300px.jpg</display-name><file-size>49835</file-size><width>300</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt>Text: New slug 2020</image-alt><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A new decade has the potential to bring new energy, focus, and vision for the next era ahead. In 2020, our unit &#8212; formerly known as the Office of Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports (OPERS) &#8212; renamed itself Athletics and Recreation, the first step in a larger brand refresh. A lot of work has been done and much more is underway. While our unit&#8217;s renaming is important, one of the most important projects this year is our #NewSlug2020 campaign.</p>
<p>You may have heard, seen, or even provided feedback on our campus identity at UC Santa Cruz. We have indeed entered into developing the next Sammy Slug for Athletics and Recreation. It is important to note that while we hope our new Sammy Slug is well known and embraced by all, it will not replace our academic, Fiat Slug logo. This most popular iteration of our beloved mascot has an illustrious history. The Fiat Slug holds a place close to all of our hearts and is integral to our story as Banana Slugs. What we will accomplish in 2020 will be inclusive of everyone&#8217;s insights as we develop and unleash the next era of Sammy Slug at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The data collected during fall 2019 has been analyzed, and has led us to the first design sketches for the new UC Santa Cruz Athletics and Recreation logo. We have collected feedback from current students, faculty/staff, and alumni. With over 2,700 initial survey responses we know there is a lot to consider. Students comprised 33% of the feedback, faculty/staff contributed 10%, and alumni submitted the bulk of the feedback so far at 52% of initial survey responses. We are excited to hear from much more of our current community in the coming design phases.</p>
<p>I want to take this moment to invite and encourage everyone in our campus community to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeaV_fIXGR1rjVsc8eI55lBwxLh_4DBYk_vLxr50a86GTiHSA/viewform">participate in this communal and exciting movement</a>. Your feedback throughout the process is vital to this effort. We know how important the Banana Slug is to you, and we want to make you prouder than ever to be a Banana Slug. Throughout this effort, we are intending to illuminate inclusion, historical perspective, and vision for the next era of the Athletics and Recreation Banana Slug. We are ecstatic to invite your participation in the design&#8217;s progression.</p>
<p>Please be on the lookout for dates, times, and locations for in-person #SlugTalks to provide direct feedback in town hall style events. In addition, the online survey is now available online, in our Go Slugs mobile application, and on our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeaV_fIXGR1rjVsc8eI55lBwxLh_4DBYk_vLxr50a86GTiHSA/viewform">websites</a>. We are eager for our community&#8217;s feedback during each design phase. Everyone on campus is welcome to participate in creating our next logo and brand identity throughout the rest of this academic year. We invite you to provide direct feedback, and be part of UC Santa Cruz history in the making.<br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1253f8d780727017465cacce8ea3c931"><name>limiting-non-essential-travel-to-china</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Limiting non-essential travel to China</title><summary>To protect the health of the university community in the midst of a dynamic situation with the coronavirus, the UC Office of the President has directed that faculty, staff, and students should avoid all non-essential travel to China. </summary><start-date>1580803200000</start-date><display-name>Limiting non-essential travel to China</display-name><path>/2020/02/limiting-non-essential-travel-to-china</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/02/limiting-non-essential-travel-to-china</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1580855457974</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594749174497</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>To protect the health of the university community in the midst of a dynamic situation with the coronavirus, the UC Office of the President has directed that faculty, staff, and students should avoid all non-essential travel to China.

<p>The study, <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.3024">published February 5 in <em>Ecosphere</em></a>, is the first of its kind to predict the distribution of fishes throughout central African freshwaters by linking museum records to ecological data. That synthesis allowed the study&#8217;s authors to infer how the nearly 40 dams planned for construction in Gabon might affect its many fish species.</p>
<p>Many of the culturally and economically important fish species in Gabon move from the ocean into rivers, with some known to swim up to 250 miles upstream into pure freshwaters.</p>
<p>Lead author Joseph Cutler, who recently earned his Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, worked with researchers at Oregon State University on the study, conducting extensive field research in Gabon.</p>
<p>Gabon has some of the world&#8217;s most pristine unimpeded river systems and high freshwater biodiversity. The proposed dams will block access to much of the freshwater habitat that is also suitable for marine species and will impact at least 350 fish species, said coauthor Brian Sidlauskas of Oregon State University.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our modeling found that particularly in Gabon&#8217;s second-largest river, the Nyanga, dam development could cut marine fishes off from 60% of the most suitable freshwater habitats, representing 392 river kilometers,&#8221; Sidlauskas said.</p>
<p>Previous research shows that freshwater ecosystems are among the most imperiled in the world. Approximately 20% of the assessed freshwater fishes are threatened with extinction, and dams are causing major shifts in species distribution and abundance, including extinctions.</p>
<p>There are three free-flowing rivers at least 500 kilometers in length in Gabon: the Ivindo, the Nyanga, which is currently undammed, and the Ogoou&#233;. While the 38 proposed dams in Gabon, including 28 in the Ogoou&#233; watershed, can increase energy production, they would fragment and alter relatively pristine river systems, according to the study coauthors.</p>
<p>Potentially impacted fish species include the Giant African threadfin, snappers, croakers, bonga shad, mullets, Atlantic tarpon, and tongue soles. Though these fishes are known to enter rivers regularly as adults or as juveniles, most of the 38 potential dam sites have never been scientifically surveyed for their presence, and no previous formal studies of fish movement within Gabon&#8217;s freshwater ecosystems had been conducted.</p>
<p>For their study, researchers at OSU and UC Santa Cruz, compiled records for fresh and brackish water fishes of Gabon and Equatorial Guinea from three databases, and grouped them by guilds. An ecological guild is any group of species that exploits the same resources, or that exploit different resources in similar ways.</p>
<p>The research team used a geographic information system to record river data to create two connectivity scenarios: one under existing dams and one with the proposed dams. The model used guild data, which included traits and prevalence; topography, including tree canopy cover, waterfalls or steep changes in elevation; and other hydrological information.</p>
<p>The model predicted marine-associated fishes had a high likelihood of occupying the Nyanga and its major tributaries and much of the Ogoou&#233;&#8217;s main channel, as well as portions of its major tributaries. Construction of all the proposed dams might lead to a loss of access to 7% of highly suitable habitats, or 466 stream kilometers. These losses were largest on the Nyanga, Ogoou&#233;, Mvoung, Lolo, Komo, and Okano rivers.</p>
<p>In addition to Cutler and Sidlauskas, coauthors of the paper include Ivan Arismendi and J. Andr&#233;s Olivos at OSU. This work was funded in part by the Nature Conservancy.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1bca368080727017465caccecec3bb25"><name>stevenson-college-profile-story</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Stevenson College: An inclusive, collaborative social atmosphere</title><summary>Stevenson College was built on a legacy of responsibility, engagement, and mutual understanding, preparing students to become leaders and to make positive social change in their communities.</summary><start-date>1580976000000</start-date><display-name>Stevenson College: An inclusive, collaborative social atmosphere</display-name><path>/2020/02/stevenson-college-profile-story</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/02/stevenson-college-profile-story</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1581014201944</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1581016209168</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa Weckerle</name><title></title><phone/><email>mweckerl@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/02/images/yang.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/02/images/yang.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>yang.jpg</name><display-name>yang.jpg</display-name><file-size>10887</file-size><width>170</width><height>280</height></image><image-alt>Stevenson College Provost Alice Yang</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/02/images/stevenson-thumbnail-provost-yang.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/02/images/stevenson-thumbnail-provost-yang.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stevenson-thumbnail-provost-yang.jpg</name><display-name>stevenson-thumbnail-provost-yang.jpg</display-name><file-size>1920</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Stevenson College Provost Alice Yang</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Stevenson College Provost Alice Yang</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/02/images/stevenson-students-studying-laughing.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/02/images/stevenson-students-studying-laughing.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stevenson-students-studying-laughing.jpg</name><file-size>42072</file-size><width>300</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Students studying and laughing at Stevenson College</image-alt><image-caption>A snapshot of Stevenson College student life.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public service is built into the name of the college, which celebrates politician Adlai E. Stevenson, known for his strong democratic values. Stevenson was governor of Illinois from 1949 to 1953 and passed just fourteen months prior to the naming of the college.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stevenson College honors his legacy through service learning courses, allowing students to build connections within their communities and make positive social impacts. The college also has programs and curriculum that encourage leadership.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve had a lot of alumni who have gone on to careers in public service ranging from judges, social workers, nonprofit employees, and politicians,&#8221; said Alice Yang, Stevenson College provost and associate professor of history.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Breaking down cultural divides</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stevenson College&#8217;s diverse student body shares a passion for creating an inclusive, collaborative social atmosphere.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stevenson&#8217;s Rosa Parks African American Theme House (R.PAATH) provides a safe and supportive living environment for students of color. Its bold, African-themed red, green, black, and gold color scheme celebrates Pan-African identities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The R.PAATH house is a clear, visual statement of our commitment to support our students in a variety of ways,&#8221; Yang said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stevenson is made up of many other groups that unite around shared cultures or interests such as community service, sustainability practices, activism, music, and art.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These communities make Stevenson diverse and lively,&#8221; said Katie Collins (Stevenson &#8216;20, business management economics). &#8220;Each community teaches and shares their culture, experiences, and hobbies with others.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Rainbow Theater at Stevenson College, a multicultural theater group formed in the early 1990s, is another place where students can embrace and celebrate diversity. Spring performances feature student actors from various ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Participants can also choose to work in production, writing, and videography, aside from acting.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Rainbow Theater plays a critical role in not only recruiting students of color but also supporting and retaining them,&#8221; Yang said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of Rainbow Theater is to bridge the gap between cultural divides in the community and enhance mutual understanding and acceptance.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another popular college hub is the Stevenson Coffeehouse, one of the college&#8217;s most beloved and oldest gathering spots. This welcoming caf&#233; gives off a cozy, relaxed vibe while serving up delicious coffee and treats.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Self and Society&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the moment they begin their classes, Stevenson students become immersed in the college&#8217;s core values. All first-year students at the college take a</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">two-quarter core course to explore the college&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self and Society</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> theme.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first quarter features historical texts from Plato, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Tao Te Ching, with a strong focus on the origins and development of societies, while the second quarter examines more modern and critical social justice texts, allowing students to expand their range of perspectives and understanding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The core course gave me a different voice as a student of color,&#8221; said Katrina Lewis (Stevenson &#8216;20, psychology). &#8220;The themes really resonated with me, and it helped students from varying backgrounds gain a sense of understanding.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-quarter sequence builds a strong sense of community at the college.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Stevenson provides a real commitment to a liberal arts education,&#8221; said Stevenson lecturer Kiva Silver.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty play a key role in fostering social growth for students while helping them make the transition from high school to college.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By steering young scholars toward academic and social resources, and making themselves accessible to students, Stevenson faculty are invested in student success. Every quarter during finals, Provost Yang has opened up the Stevenson provost house doors to students during finals week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This event, known as final study breaks, gives students a stress-free time away from their worries and textbooks. During these breaks, they can mingle with peers, enjoy free meals, and get advice and support from their provost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provost Yang buys upward of 30 pizzas each night and a variety of snacks and desserts from Costco. Students especially enjoy her baked brie, chocolate chip cookies, and brownies fresh from the oven.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yang started these study breaks to make herself more accessible to students, to help students cope with the anxiety caused by finals, and to support the growing number of students suffering from the </span><a href="https://magazine.ucsc.edu/2019/10/food-for-all/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">food insecurity crisis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> happening on college campuses nationwide.</span></p>
<p><strong>A transformative and empowering education</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stevenson College does more than just instill a sense of community. It also trains its students to become successful and caring alumni. Its growing network of professors, staff, and peers help students take part in careers that will make a difference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stevenson Alumni Career Education courses allow students to meet and network with alumni in careers that interest them. One course focuses on legal and public service careers. Another course focuses on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from advising students, Stevenson&#8217;s active alumni base provides annual donations that make a huge difference for the college, Yang said. &#8220;Their generosity helps us offer courses, like the Alumni Career Education courses, programs, research opportunities, and scholarships,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stevenson also offers a College Scholars Program (CSP) to high-achieving first-year students who have performed well during their first quarter at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these different facets of Stevenson make this college a place of personal and social engagement for students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your college experience is what you make of it," said student Lewis, "and knowing that when you choose a college community based on mutual interests and values, like I did for Stevenson, it makes your experience that much more enjoyable.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1d30abd480727017465cacce94453615"><name>womens-rugby</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Women's Rugby celebrates 40 years</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Women's Rugby team celebrates its 40-year history, including numerous titles and hundreds of friendships.</summary><keywords>rugby, women's rugby</keywords><start-date>1581037200000</start-date><display-name>womens-rugby-40</display-name><path>/2020/02/womens-rugby</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/02/womens-rugby</link><created-by>jhillard</created-by><created-on>1581037693861</created-on><last-modified-by>jhillard</last-modified-by><last-modified>1581097008952</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Sports</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>J.D.

Now, it is one of the campus&#8217; most well-established athletics clubs, with a rich history and traditions. It has often been among the top performing teams and has brought home several national titles.<br/><br/>In 1979, Martha Brown (Kresge &#8216;81, biology and sociology), Tracy Brann Schilling (Porter &#8216;76, art), Elinor Tatham (Cowell '85, biology), Becky Thompson (Carson &#8216;82, sociology), and Becky Teaford Boonman (Merrill '79, Latin American studies) founded the team. Forty years later, these women still maintain many deep friendships created through a shared love for the game that began on UCSC's rugby pitch.&#160;<br/><br/>The team <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/605140433618791/">celebrates its 40th anniversary February 15</a> with current players and alumni, including Brown and other team founders.<br/><br/>&#8220;The friends I made in that group are still some of my best friends,&#8221; Brown said. <br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s really exciting to have the opportunity to get back together again.&#8221;<br/><br/>For Brown and many other players, the intensive teamwork and physical challenge of the game made it a source of camaraderie during their undergraduate years. <br/><br/>&#8220;It was a pivotal moment in our lives, &#8221; she said. <br/><br/>This year&#8217;s team, captained by Loren Roudtree (Stevenson &#8216;20, technology and information management), benefits from an increase in popularity for the game. Roundtree has played since her second year of high school, drawn to the complex strategy and the friendships that grow out of the team.<br/><br/>&#8220;You really have to work together,&#8221; Roundtree said. &#8220;If not it really shows.&#8221;<br/><br/>Halfway through the current season, Roundtree has led the team to four wins in five matches. <br/><br/>When Michelle Sit (Oakes &#8216;08, feminist studies) and her teammates in 2006 began their season, they had no idea how far they would go. That year, they won the Pacfic Western Conference and the Elite 8&#8217;s Tournament in Florida. They then finished the season by winning the USA rugby Division II women&#8217;s collegiate championship at Stanford&#8217;s Steuber Stadium.</p>
<p>The team returned to the nationals again the following year, taking second place.<br/><br/>&#8220;Nobody really expected anything,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We just loved playing rugby.&#8221;<br/><br/>Sit was raised as a New Zealand All-Blacks rugby fan. She chose UC Santa Cruz because of the rugby club and joined immediately when she arrived on campus. <br/> <br/>&#8220;It was good to be part of something,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Picture 20 empowering, strong minded women. I had no idea how much of my identity would come out of being at UCSC as a leader on a rugby team.&#8221; <br/><br/>Sit describes rugby as a &#8220;pure&#8221; sport.<br/><br/>&#8220;After the game, you generally buy a beer for the person you gave a black eye to,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>The idea is to read books from a wide variety of genres and explore their implications on our politics, inner lives, and communities. Driven by our rapidly changing and tumultuous times, The Deep Read is designed to be a new platform for intellectual engagement, classes on campus, and major events with top writers and thinkers.</p>
<p>The inaugural Deep Read book selected for 2020 is Margaret Atwood&#8217;s latest Booker Prize-winning novel, <em>The Testaments</em>--a sequel to her 1985 classic about a dystopian future, <em>The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale</em>, which was adapted into a critically acclaimed television series.</p>
<p>To kick off the program, The Humanities Institute (THI) at UC Santa Cruz is giving away free copies of Atwood&#8217;s <em>The Testaments</em> to the first 1,000 students to sign up for The Deep Read, and another 200 books to the first Deep Readers outside the campus who sign up as well.</p>
<p>The program, which includes digital programming to help deepen the reading experience and salons hosted by UCSC in Santa Cruz, Los Angeles, and New York, runs parallel with a class and various events on campus, bringing insights from such fields as Literature, Feminist Studies, Engineering, and Anthropology to bear on Atwood&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>It all comes together with a visit by Margaret Atwood to UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Quarry Amphitheater on April 5 for a conversation with alumna Kate Schatz, the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Rad American Women A-Z</em>, as part of the Humanities Division&#8217;s annual Peggy Downes Baskin Ethics Lecture Series. Admission is $30, but free tickets will be available to the first 1,000 students who register to attend.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t be more thrilled about the Deep Read program,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;UCSC&#8217;s reputation as a home to cross-campus collaboration is built on exactly this kind of initiative. It brings people together through common purpose and inquiry. The conversation extends into the greater community, too. That can pay even greater dividends on a host of issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Literature professor and Porter College provost Sean Keilen worked closely with The Humanities Institute in developing the program.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reading and lively conversation are the heart and soul of higher education,&#8221; said Keilen. &#8220;By creating The Deep Read, in collaboration with the colleges, The Humanities Institute makes it clear that on our campus, the foundation for a peaceful and flourishing community is the free exchange of ideas, grounded in shared texts and common concerns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a member of the Literature Department, I am especially glad that a novel was chosen to launch this new program. Great works of fiction reveal the truth of other people's circumstances like no other genre of human activity and, in doing so, allow us to pass beyond the limits of our own experience, change, and grow,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Atwood&#8217;s work has been published in&#160;over 45 countries, and she is the author of more than 50 books of fiction, poetry, critical essays, and graphic novels.<em>&#160;</em>She is the recipient of numerous awards, including&#160;the&#160;Peace Prize of the German Book Trade, the Franz Kafka International Literary&#160;Prize, the PEN Center USA Lifetime Achievement Award,&#160;and&#160;the&#160;<em>Los Angeles Times</em>&#160;Innovator&#8217;s Award.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz is known around the world for its learning communities and I can&#8217;t imagine a better way to pull a community together--regardless of their location--than through a discussion of an important author like Margaret Atwood and her newest book&#160;<em>The Testaments,&#8221; </em>noted Irena Poli&#263;, managing director of The Humanities Institute.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of our core commitments at The Humanities Institute is engaging with the broadest community possible--from first-generation students and scholars in every discipline, to local residents and anyone interested in making sense of our complex world,&#8221; she added.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Some UC Santa Cruz graduate students have announced they will begin an unsanctioned, open-ended labor strike starting on Monday, Feb. 10. While we do not know how this strike will impact campus, organizers have said in an email to campus leaders they will not be teaching, grading, holding office hours, and/or conducting research. Picketing at the base of campus is also anticipated. <a href="grad-strike-notice.xml">Read more</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated><value>Yes</value></show-updated><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="21d93f7480727017465cacce61751bcd"><name>coronavirus-info</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> 2019 Novel Coronavirus</title><summary>This letter serves to update everyone with accurate information obtained from the CDC and state communicable disease specialists. </summary><start-date>1581062400000</start-date><display-name> 2019 Novel Coronavirus</display-name><path>/2020/02/coronavirus-info</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/02/coronavirus-info</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1581115850573</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594749258586</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The potential threat of a new virus can be frightening and overwhelming, particularly with misinformation and rumors that can spread through our community and on the internet.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The current outbreak of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is prompting a global response. (Image from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3397359/">Belouzard et al., 2012</a>)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The <a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a> is facilitating research into the novel coronavirus that has infected thousands of people since an outbreak began in Wuhan, China, last year. The Genomics Institute&#8217;s browser team has now posted the complete genome of the virus on the <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Genome Browser</a>, an interactive web-based tool used by researchers all over the world to study genetic data.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we display coronavirus data in the UCSC Genome Browser, it lets researchers look at the virus&#8217; structure and more importantly work with it so they can research how they want to attack it,&#8221; said UCSC Genome Browser Engineer Hiram Clawson.</p>
<p>The rapid spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also known as the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus) has prompted the Chinese government to quarantine more than 50 million people in the country&#8217;s dense industrial heartland. Samples of the virus have been processed in labs all over the world, and the raw information about its genetic code has been sent to the worldwide repository of genomic information at the National Institutes of Health&#8217;s National Center for Bioinformatics (NCBI) in Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
<p>&#8220;The NCBI is a worldwide repository established in the very early days of genomics,&#8221; said Clawson. &#8220;When people find novel viruses, they send them to the NCBI, and the NCBI assigns them a name and number so everyone can refer to an exact specimen. Once they&#8217;ve processed the genomic information, it&#8217;s made available to the world from the database.&#8221;</p>
<p>From there, the UC Santa Cruz Genome Browser processes the information into a visual display. The genome of the virus consists of 29,903 nucleotides&#8212;the bases that make up the DNA and RNA molecules that encode all life on earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we obtain this data from NCBI, it&#8217;s a single file with the letters in it from the DNA or RNA (A,C,G, and T),&#8221; Clawson said. &#8220;This one happens to be single-stranded RNA, a relatively simple structure.&#8221;</p>
<p>This information is processed and placed into a database, where the Genome Browser can access the material and display it in a web browser in a much more useful format.</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes the Genome Browser so valuable is that it is so visual,&#8221; Clawson said. &#8220;It makes it very clear where everything is, so when people make interesting measurements about the genome in the virus, they can see what they&#8217;re looking at,&#8221; Clawson said.</p>
<p>Researchers can zoom in and out of the genome. This allows them to see the sequence of bases at the most detailed level or zoom all the way out and see individual genes.</p>
<p>The browser also contains a CRISPR track, which allows researchers to see where they can splice genetic material and how they can cut it. With CRISPR technology, researchers can edit genetic material, a tremendously valuable tool for determining which genes do what.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the case of this virus,&#8221; Clawson said, &#8220;there are approximately ten genes and the largest is its spike protein,&#8221; referring to the chemical spine which the virus uses to snag onto human cells and hijack their cellular machinery to reproduce itself. &#8220;So they might make a change to see if it makes the spike protein more or less virulent.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Browser also allows for annotation, so researchers all over the world can collaborate and share experimental information.</p>
<p>The UCSC Genome Browser is among the most important tools ever created by genomics researchers at UC Santa Cruz. By establishing a standard interface and protocols for examining genetic information, they&#8217;ve unlocked breakthroughs in bioinformatics and genetics laboratories all over the world.</p>

<p>Fall grades were due on December 18th, 2019. Since this date, we have been working together with deans, department chairs, and faculty regarding missing grades in an effort to post grades and mitigate impacts, with a focus on students&#8217; financial aid, enrollment status, graduation, major declaration and other academic decisions.</p>
<p>As of today, many students do not have a grade in one or more courses. Some faculty have requested access to the &#8216;P&#8217; grade because they have sufficient information to confirm some or all ungraded students in their class have earned a C or better, but due to lack of complete information are not able to fully differentiate among the exact letter grades that would convert to a Pass.</p>
<p>Having received concurrence from the Academic Senate Committee on Educational Policy (CEP), I have asked University Registrar Sanger to make available the <strong>Pass (P) grade</strong> as an option for letter-graded undergraduates as an interim measure.</p>
<p>The use of &#8216;P&#8217; grades will allow for academic processes to continue (additional information regarding each can be found below in &#8220;Detailed Information on Expected P grade Impacts&#8221;).</p>
<p>For example, enrollment appointments will be set on February 12th. In the absence of a &#8216;P&#8221; grade, a student with missing grades, and hence missing units, will be scheduled for a later enrollment appointment time than a fully graded student. This means that students with missing grades may find more classes filled and receive worse waitlist positions than would be the case if all their grades had been posted.</p>
<p>This option is now available for instructors to assign to students who had chosen the letter grade option. Pass (P) grades for undergraduates who requested letter grades are to be regarded as temporary, to be changed on MyUCSC (AIS) once the instructor has sufficient information to assign the correct letter grade. The Pass (P) grade should only be assigned for student&#8217;s &#8220;work which would otherwise receive a grade of C (2.0) or better&#8221; (<a href="https://senate.ucsc.edu/manual/santacruz-division-manual/part-two-regulations/section-three-ug-program/chapter-nine-grades-eval-records/index.html">Academic Senate Regulation 9.1.2</a>). An assigned P grade should not be changed to a grade lower than a C at a future time.</p>
<p>Additional information about expected impacts of P grade assignment are below. The Not Passed (NP) grade option is not being made available for reasons that are explained below.</p>
<p>Thank you, <br/>Richard</p>
<p>Richard Hughey <br/>Vice Provost and Dean, Undergraduate Education</p>
<h3>Detailed Information on expected P grade impacts</h3>
<p>CEP discussed the academic impact of missing grades in its <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5VMKKJ10-sANV9SM1NhSENkOVJmLThjLUdLb2ZwTFBySjZN/view">January 27th memo</a>, including major declaration; determination of class level and enrollment appointments; graduation and degree satisfaction; prerequisites; and academic standing. Missing grades can also affect quarterly dean&#8217;s honors and the financial aid status of students.</p>
<p>Assigning an interim Pass (P) grade to a student who has elected letter grades will have impacts that will generally be positive among the 7 domains discussed above. For the great majority of students, it will be better to temporarily have a Pass (P) grade than a missing grade.</p>
<ul>
<li>Major declaration. A Pass (P) grade will confirm satisfaction of a major declaration requirement, but will not contribute to the major declaration GPA requirement, if applicable. To the extent that the true grade may have shifted the overall declaration GPA above or below the threshold, some students who should not have to may need to appeal to declare the major, and others who should have been subject to appeal may not need to. Programs will need to be sensitive to these issues.</li>
<li>Class level and enrollment appointments. A Pass (P) grade will mitigate impacts with respect to class level and enrollment appointment.</li>
<li>Graduation and degree satisfaction. A Pass (P) grade will in general mitigate impacts with respect to graduation and degree satisfaction with the exception of students just below the 2.0 GPA threshold for graduation, who thus need grades, and grade points, higher than a C (2.0), in order to raise the GPA to meet this UC requirement. Some programs have letter-grade requirements, which programs may choose to waive for students with a P grade as a result of the grade strike. Students may not be eligible for department or University Honors for students not meeting the GPA standard.</li>
<li>Prerequisites. A Pass (P) grade will confirm prerequisite satisfaction.</li>
<li>Academic standing. A Pass (P) grade will not influence the GPA, meaning that a student in poor standing would not have the advantage of an A or B to increase their GPA. A P grade will generally be positive for academic standing review or appeals as a qualitative indicator of academic achievement.</li>
<li>Quarterly Dean&#8217;s Honors. A Pass (P) grade may change eligibility for quarterly Dean&#8217;s Honors, which requires that students earn a minimum of 15 credits, including at least 10 with letter grades, and achieve a 3.73 GPA. A P grade may result in a higher or lower quarter GPA, and multiple P grades may impact eligibility based on letter grade credits.</li>
<li>Financial Aid. A Pass (P) grade will be generally positive in financial aid processes, with the exception of students needing to improve their GPA.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Pass (P) grade, &#8220;C or higher,&#8221; may be considered a lower indicator of achievement than our most commonly-assigned grades (A or B, with or without modifier). Students with P grades may be impacted in situations that include transcript review, such as graduate school application.</p>
<p>The Not Passed (NP) grade has not been added as an option. This is because the NP reflects one non-passing grade (F), and four marginally-passing grades (D-, D, D+, C-). The four marginally-passing grades contribute to academic progress toward the 180-unit requirement, and thus are important to be assigned, especially for financial aid issues. As previously messaged to departments, work with your TAs to ensure that the grades for any non-passing and marginally-passing students are posted.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>Instructors with Unposted Undergraduate Fall Grades</audience><admin>Richard Hughey, Vice Provost, Undergraduate Education</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="362823e380727017465cacce513222d5"><name>heising-simons-grants</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Bringing new perspectives to astronomy</title><summary>An array of grants from the Heising-Simons Foundation is helping UC Santa Cruz accelerate astrophysics and other sciences while changing what we think an astrophysicist looks like&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text>To make a point during a 2018 conference for underrepresented minority astrophysicists, Professor Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz had the participants pose to mimic a photograph hanging in the hallway of the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, where the conference was held. The older image shows Bohr together with other prominent scientists attending a conference in 1933. <br/><br/>Like them, the 37 astrophysicists in Ramirez-Ruiz&#8217;s photo came to Copenhagen to exchange ideas and advance our understanding of the universe. But unlike the scientists in the 1933 photo&#8212;which consists almost entirely of white men&#8212;Ramirez-Ruiz&#8217;s photo displays a group composed of almost all women, many of them women of color.<br/><br/>For Cyndi Atherton, director of the Heising-Simons Foundation science program, the photo illustrates the difference the foundation aims to make with an array of recent grants to UC Santa Cruz.<br/><br/>&#8220;What if a photo like that was not an anomaly? Imagine not thinking twice if you see a picture of scientists who are mostly women and underrepresented minorities,&#8221; Atherton says. &#8220;If a picture is worth 1,000 words, that&#8217;s my 1,000 words.&#8221;<br/><br/>A family foundation established in 2007, <a href="https://www.hsfoundation.org/">Heising-Simons</a> supports climate solutions, fundamental science, education, and human rights organizations. <br/><br/>From July 2018 to January 2020, the foundation made grants totaling nearly $4 million to the campus.<br/><br/>Multiple of these support work by Ramirez-Ruiz, including an award that enabled the new Vera Rubin Chair for Diversity in Astronomy to earn matching funds from the UC Office of the President. Ramirez-Ruiz is the inaugural Vera Rubin chairholder.<br/>
<h3>The pipeline</h3>
When Ramirez-Ruiz was chair of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Department, he had an opportunity to hire a new faculty member to do computational astrophysics. Of the hundreds of applicants, less than a tenth were women. It&#8217;s a result of what he calls a pipeline problem: Women and underrepresented minority students don&#8217;t choose the sciences&#8212;in part because they don&#8217;t see faculty they can identify with.<br/><br/>&#8220;So how do we change this?&#8221; he says, noting UC Santa Cruz can&#8217;t change what other universities do. &#8220;The only thing we can take charge of is our own department.&#8221;<br/><br/>Building a healthy pipeline involves making sure common challenges for first-generation students don&#8217;t become obstacles. Ramirez-Ruiz has focused recruitment, scholarships, fellowships on increasing the portion of women and minority undergraduates in the major. He provides undergraduates with opportunities to contribute to research. <br/><br/>The Lamat program, funded in part by the Heising-Simons foundation provides intensive astronomy training for community college transfer students. <br/><br/>The approach appears to be working: The portion of astronomy and astrophysics graduate students who are women or from underrepresented backgrounds is up to 50 percent. <br/><br/>&#8220;If you really want to increase diversity, you have to work at all levels,&#8221; Ramirez-Ruiz says. &#8220;Theoretically we could hire from our own grad students. Then we could make strides in solving the pipeline.&#8221;<br/>
<h3>Monica Gallegos-Garcia</h3>
In 10th grade, Monica Gallegos-Garcia saw a National Geographic video about Jupiter and realized there are people who have jobs studying the universe. At UC Santa Cruz, she majored in astrophysics, and in her second year she told her advisor she was interested in doing research. <br/><br/>The conversation resulted in an introduction to Ramirez-Ruiz. Under his supervision, Gallegos-Garcia studied tidal disruption events, bright flares created when black holes tear apart stars. <br/><br/>&#8220;I got really great mentoring and advising and tons of support from him and from the larger network he put me in touch with,&#8221; Gallegos-Garcia says.<br/><br/>Gallegos-Garcia wrote a program to analytically describe the evolution of the flares. The work led to <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aab5b8/pdf">a paper</a> on how the abundances of different chemicals in the flares change as the stars are consumed by the black holes. <br/><br/>The work she did with Ramirez-Ruiz helped her win a <a href="https://ciera.northwestern.edu/2019/06/21/monica-gallegos-garcia-wins-ford-foundation-fellowship/">fellowship from the Ford Foundation</a>, and now she&#8217;s working toward a Ph.D. at Northwestern University.<br/><br/>In the future, she sees herself in a faculty role where she, too, can help ambitious students pursue their goals in the sciences. <br/><br/>&#8220;I hope to one day become an Enrico myself,&#8221; Gallegos-Garcia says. <br/>
<h3>Rosa Wallace Everson</h3>
<p>Support at UC Santa Cruz for diverse students seeking to become astronomers was part of what drew graduate student Rosa Wallace Everson. Everson studied physics at the University of Colorado. Deciding between graduate studies in particle physics and astronomy, she chose the latter in part because the field has been improving its inclusiveness. <br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice to move into a field where I know there&#8217;s more of a chance I could make a difference,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Are my ideas about how to improve things socially accepted? At UC Santa Cruz, the answer was a resounding &#8216;yes.&#8217;&#8221; <br/><br/>At UC Santa Cruz, she researches what happens as older stars expand and engulf nearby objects like black holes or neutron stars. Heising-Simons&#8217;s support for the Vera Rubin Chair has created opportunities for her to attend international conferences with fellow astrophysicists. Her conversations at these events help hone her own work and establish professional connections.<br/><br/>&#8220;The network is definitely in full effect,&#8221; Everson says. &#8220;My hope is once my Ph.D. is over, these people will become my collaborators.&#8221;<br/><br/>Like Gallegos Garcia, Everson intends to pursue a faculty position where she can support women and underrepresented minority students.</p>
<h3>Telescope builders of the future</h3>
In Berkeley last July, a group of researchers, instructors, and graduate and undergraduate students gathered to try out a workshop intended to expand the number of scientists, especially women, entering the field of astronomical instrumentation.<br/><br/>Astronomers need astronomical instruments&#8212;sensors, spectrometers, filters, and other gadgets&#8212;to turn what comes through telescopes into images or data they can study.<br/><br/>Building instruments is a focus that can be discouraging to students. The requirement of both science and engineering gives the impression that a degree will take longer, and there are fewer opportunities to get work into publication. And it&#8217;s a field fewer women or minority students pursue. <br/><br/>Lisa Hunter, director of the UCSC Institute for Scientist and Engineer Educators, says the <a href="https://isee-telescope-workforce.org/astrotech/">AstroTech summer School</a>, which will hold its first session in summer 2020, will teach ways around these obstacles.<br/><br/>&#8220;The workshop will break some myths,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We show how to angle a project toward publication.&#8221;<br/><br/>The one-week workshop will focus on building instruments and on inclusion. In funding the workshop, the Heising-Simons included support for last July's &#8220;development&#8221; session. <br/><br/>Instructors tested methods to avoid teaching pitfalls that can become obstacles for underrepresented students. They tested curriculum focused both on tools and techniques of building instruments and practices that ensure inclusion.<br/><br/>&#8220;You can see the beginning of a community committed to promoting more diverse people entering instrumentation careers,&#8221; says Hunter. &#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful imagining instructors coming back year after year, gathering with other instructors and mentoring the next generation.&#8221;<br/>

<p>The vision behind the project comes from two graduate students who have received a one-year, $150,000 grant to support their goal of creating environmentally sound seaweed and sea cucumber farms on the coasts of Kenya and The Gambia.</p>
<p>Patrick Cage and Maxwell Azali, both first-year masters' students in the <a href="https://csp.ucsc.edu/">Coastal Science and Policy</a> program, teamed up on a proposal to the <a href="https://bridgecollaborativeglobal.org/what-we-do/fund/">Bridge Collaborative</a>, a partnership founded in 2016 by The Nature Conservancy, Duke University, International Food Policy Research Institute, and PATH, that supports efforts to deliver more integrated solutions that benefit people and nature. Cage and Azali's project is one of only four proposals that were funded by the collaborative's <a href="https://bridgecollaborativeglobal.org/what-we-do/fund/">Bridge Spark Fund</a>.</p>
<p>Part of the beauty of the project is that it advances sustainable aquaculture and employment opportunities in ways that Cage and Azali hope will be "scalable" to other parts of Africa and beyond.</p>
<p>"We're looking at creating multiple new income streams that are diverse and resilient and sustainable over time," said Cage, who will direct the overall project. Azali, who is from Kenya, is a fisheries expert who will conduct environmental monitoring and quantitative analysis.</p>
<p>Seaweed is farmed in shallow coastal waters, where it is tied to ropes that are attached to stakes; tending and harvesting takes place at low tide. It is a low-tech, low-capital endeavor with a soft environmental impact. "It doesn't use fertilizers or freshwater or any of the agricultural chemicals that are ubiquitous around the world," said Cage. "It doesn't cause erosion, and seaweed actually marginally improves water quality."</p>
<p>Sea cucumbers, soft-bodied animals that look like cucumbers and are also called sandfish, feed by sifting sand on the ocean floor. They are farmed in "pens" to protect them from predators like crabs. Both products are farmed for export; seaweed is used to make thickeners used in toothpaste and other products, and is also sold as higher-value food products. Dried sea cucumbers are a popular food item in China and elsewhere, but they have been "heavily overfished" in Kenya, said Azali, adding, "The wild population is at risk, it is vulnerable."</p>
<p>Sustainability is at the core of both farming projects, and Cage and Azali will introduce "green" practices at every step.</p>
<p>For example, seaweed farming is somewhat established in Kenya, but variables of water temperature, light, and nutrient levels make it challenging. The farms also attract small herbivorous fish, like rabbit fish, which can be harvested by local fishermen. To mitigate potential negative impacts, Azali plans to introduce a modified basket trap with an "escape gate" that will allow juvenile fish to grow to adulthood.</p>
<p>Cage and Azali are collaborating with the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute, the Gaining Research Experience in Africa for Tomorrow (GREAT) Institute in The Gambia, and Sustainable Ocean Alliance.</p>
<p>"Aquaculture intervention is about finding communities that are excited about new livelihood options, and engaging the community around their interests," said Cage. "It includes hands-on training in growing, processing, and selling the product. One of the promises of aquaculture is to give people a predictable source of income over time."</p>
<p>Cage and Azali are focusing their efforts on three villages in Kenya and two in The Gambia, where seaweed and sandfish farming are novel approaches. The Gambia is one of the least-developed countries in the world, according to the United Nations, and the villages in Kenya where the project will take root are small and undeveloped. About 40 households will participate, greatly expanding opportunities for residents who rely on subsistence farming, fishing, and, for some, tourism, which has dropped significantly in recent years. Importantly, seaweed farms will provide an income stream for women, who typically manage and tend the farms.</p>
<p>The project's support will extend beyond harvest to marketing and the creation of business cooperatives, said Cage, who leaves for Africa in early March and expects to spend most of the year there. Azali will spend 2-3 weeks in Kenya in March.</p>
<p>Success will be measured by a host of environmental indicators over time and the impacts on households: employment and income, as well as health, nutrition, and access to education. In their application for funding, Cage and Azali also emphasized the "scalability" of their proposal. "This is a pilot project," said Cage. "Part of defining success is asking if this is a viable model for other parts of Kenya, The Gambia, other African countries, and around the world."</p>
<p>Azali was working with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in Kenya as a fisheries researcher when he was introduced to the CSP program. WCS partners with CSP and is underwriting part of Azali's participation in the two-year graduate program, with support from the Beinecke African Conservation Scholarship. Cage was a climate policy professional when he learned of the CSP program from director Anne Kapuscinski, whom he met when both were attending the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco in 2018.</p>
<p>"Patrick and Maxwell are leading the way toward the kinds of transformational change we need in the world today," said Kapuscinski. "As individuals, they are bridging the developed and developing world, and they've forged a strong partnership that taps their expertise and their on-the-ground connections. This is a uniquely powerful project."</p>

<p>The study, <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52343">published February 11 in <em>eLife</em></a>, shows that the same molecular switch mechanism affected by these mutations is at work in animals ranging from fruit flies to people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many people with sleep phase disorders have changes in their clock proteins,&#8221; said Carrie Partch, associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz and a corresponding author of the paper. &#8220;Generally, mutations that make the clock run shorter have a morning lark effect, and those that make the clock run longer have a pronounced night owl effect.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the new study, researchers focused on mutations in an enzyme called casein kinase 1 (CK1), which regulates a core clock protein called PERIOD (or PER). Clock-altering mutations in CK1 had been known for years, but it was unclear how they changed the timing of the clock.</p>
<p>CK1 and other kinase enzymes carry out a reaction called phosphorylation, adding a phosphate to another protein. It turns out that CK1 can phosphorylate either of two sites on the PER protein. Modifying one site stabilizes PER, while the other modification triggers its degradation. Partch and her colleagues showed how mutations in either CK1 or PER itself can alter the balance, favoring degradation over stabilization.</p>
<p>PER proteins are part of a complex feedback loop in which changes in their abundance set the timing of circadian rhythms, so mutations that increase the rate of PER degradation throw off the clock.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we discovered is this neat molecular switch that controls the abundance of the PER proteins. When it&#8217;s working right, it generates a beautiful 24-hour oscillation,&#8221; Partch said.</p>
<p>Partch&#8217;s lab performed structural and biochemical analyses of the CK1 and PER proteins that suggested how the switch works. To confirm that the interactions observed in the test tube matched the behavior of the proteins in living cells, they worked with researchers at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. Other collaborators at UC San Diego performed simulations of the molecular dynamics of the switch showing how the CK1 protein switches between two conformations, and how mutations cause it to favor one conformation over another.</p>
<p>The switch involves a section of the CK1 protein called the activation loop. One conformation of this loop favors binding of CK1 to the &#8220;degron&#8221; region of PER, where phosphorylation leads to the protein&#8217;s degradation. The clock-changing mutations in CK1 cause it to favor this degron-binding conformation.</p>
<p>The other conformation favors binding to a site on the PER protein known as the FASP region, because mutations in this region lead to an inherited sleep disorder called Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome. The stabilization of PER can be disrupted by either the FASP mutations, which interfere with the binding of CK1 to this region, or by the mutations in CK1 that favor the alternate conformation of the activation loop.</p>
<p>The new findings also suggest why binding of CK1 to the FASP region stabilizes PER. With phosphorylation of the FASP region, that region then acts to bind and inhibit CK1, preventing it from adopting the other conformation and phosphorylating the degron region.</p>
<p>&#8220;It binds and locks the kinase down, so it&#8217;s like a pause button that prevents the PERIOD protein from being degraded too soon,&#8221; Partch said. &#8220;This stabilizing region builds a delay into the clock to make it align with Earth&#8217;s 24-hour day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Partch noted that it is important to understand how these clock proteins regulate our circadian rhythms, because those rhythms affect not only the sleep cycle but almost every aspect of our physiology. Understanding these molecular mechanisms may enable scientists to develop therapies for intervening in the clock to alleviate disruptions, whether they are caused by inherited conditions or by shift work or jet lag.</p>
<p>&#8220;There might be ways to mitigate some of those effects,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>CK1 is also interesting because it seems to be the most ancient component of biological clocks. The whole feedback loop involving CK1, PERIOD, and other core clock proteins is found in all animals from insects to humans. CK1, however, is also found in every other organism with eukaryotic (nonbacterial) cells, including single-celled green algae in which it has been implicated in circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our results provide a mechanistic foundation to understand the essentially universal role of CK1 as a regulator of eukaryotic circadian clocks,&#8221; Partch said.</p>

<p>UC Santa Cruz Alumni Weekend, from Friday&#8211;Sunday, April 3&#8211;5, will be a chance for returning Slugs to reminisce about their time on campus. But this year&#8217;s rendition will also give Slugs an opportunity to confront and discuss visions of a frightening sci-fi future.&#160;</p>
<p>Bestselling and celebrated novelist Margaret Atwood, author of the 1985 speculative fiction epic <em>The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale,</em> will be shaking up Alumni Weekend, while adding a big dose of literary credibility and star power to this year&#8217;s festivities.&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;In a ticketed event on Sunday, April 5, at the campus&#8217;s 2,500-capacity Quarry Amphitheater, Atwood will have an onstage conversation with Kate Schatz (Stevenson '01, women&#8217;s studies and creative writing), bestselling author of <em>Rad American Women A-Z </em>and <em>Rad Women Worldwide</em>.&#160;</p>
<p>The talk is part of The Humanities Institutes' Baskin Ethics Lecture series, and will be open to the public and students. <a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/margaret_atwood#.XjCHHBdKjKa">Tickets are $30 (free for the first 1,000 UCSC students to sign up) and may be purchased via the UC Santa Cruz events calendar</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>Atwood has written dozens of books and other works, but <em>The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale</em> is her most influential to date, introducing millions to a terrifyingly plausible future in which environmental degradation has compromised human fertility and the U.S. government is overthrown by a totalitarian theocracy that enslaves the few still-fertile women as child-bearers for the ruling class, and other women as servants.. The book has sold 8 million copies and been turned into an Emmy-winning television series on Hulu.</p>
<p>&#8220;The event could possibly be the biggest of the academic year,&#8221; said Irena Polic (Cowell '01, M.A. '03, linguistics), managing director of The Humanities Institute (THI), which is presenting the onstage discussion with Atwood and Schatz.</p>
<p>A long-awaited <em>Handmaid's Tale</em> sequel, <em>The Testaments,</em> released in September, quickly made the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list and won the 2019 Booker Prize.&#160;</p>
<p>In preparation for Atwood's visit, THI is launching a new initiative, <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/deepread/">The Deep Read</a>. Students and alumni will have access to weeks of digital programming exploring the impact of <em>The Testaments</em> on our politics, inner lives, and communities. There will be salons in Los Angeles, New York City, and Santa Cruz where UC Santa Cruz scholars will discuss the novel with the community, making Atwood's visit during Alumni Weekend even more meaningful.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s gathering, a signature celebration honoring UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s rapidly expanding network of an estimated 115,000 Slugs, was moved from late April to the beginning of April to make this special event possible.</p>
<p><strong>Fun on Friday</strong></p>
<p>But if a dystopian future frightens you, never fear; Alumni Weekend has a long list of possibilities for revelers, starting on Friday, April 3.&#160;</p>
<p>For starters, the artistically inclined and the curious should stop by the foundry behind UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Theater Arts complex, and you will see an artisan pouring molten bronze in the last functional foundry in the entire UC system. The demonstration will run from 2 to 4 p.m. that Friday.</p>
<p>Or consider opening up your mind, and raising a glass, during the Alumni Weekend <a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/alumni_weekend_welcome_happy_hour_westside_research_park_open_house#.XjcVnhNKjOQ">Welcome Happy Hour &amp; Westside Research Park Open House.</a> At this off-campus event, held at the Westside Research Park/Genomics Institute open house, research investigators will discuss their most recent breakthroughs.

Officers repeatedly tried to de-escalate the situation and made clear that blocking this major roadway had to stop or it would lead to arrest. Demonstrators locked arms, sat in the roadway, and refused to move back onto the university field.</p>
<p>During Monday&#8217;s unsanctioned strike activity, there were several dangerous incidents between vehicles and picketers when this major intersection was blocked. The safety of everyone in our community is our highest priority. Failing to comply with an order to disperse and obstructing a roadway is extremely dangerous, and it is also against the law. The participants in the unsanctioned strike were arrested for unlawful assembly, failure to disperse, and unlawful obstruction of the free movement of any person on any street, sidewalk, or other public place. While we understand the frustration about housing costs in Santa Cruz, we also have responsibilities to the vast majority of our faculty, staff and students who simply want to do what they came to UC Santa Cruz to do&#8211;to study, to teach, and conduct research.</p>
<p>UCSC&#8217;s police officers have a critical role in ensuring safety and security to all on campus. They protect everyone&#8217;s ability to exercise the constitutionally protected rights of free expression, speech, and assembly. These rights do not extend, however, to disrupting regular and essential operations of the university by occupying offices, blocking roads, or infringing on the rights of others.</p>
<p>It is essential that emergency responders, the Santa Cruz community, and the campus community can freely travel through the city, and on and off the residential campus. Moreover, in addition to the 9,300 students who live on campus, UC Santa Cruz is home to families with young children and elderly residents. We hope today&#8217;s protests remain peaceful and lawful.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Public Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="409a92cc80727017465cacce4a98848b"><name>oelze-africa</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Using isotopes to reconstruct life histories within the transatlantic slave trade</title><summary>Four hundred years after the displacement of millions of Africans began, anthropologist Vicky Oelze wants to use isotope biogeochemistry to trace back and identify the origins of individuals who were abducted and perished in the Americas. </summary><keywords>anthropology, archaeology, strontium, isotope, slavery, transatlantic, benin, africa</keywords><start-date>1581580800000</start-date><display-name>Oelze-Africa</display-name><path>/2020/02/oelze-africa</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/02/oelze-africa</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1581631836844</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1581640753874</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Anthropology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/02/images/oelze_400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/02/images/oelze_400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>oelze_400.jpg</name><display-name>oelze_400.jpg</display-name><file-size>47146</file-size><width>400</width><height>477</height></image><image-alt>Vicky Oelze</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/02/images/oelze-map_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/02/images/oelze-map_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>oelze-map_80.jpg</name><display-name>oelze-map_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>4481</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Map of equatorial Africa showing strontium isotope sampling locations</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>"We know villages were destroyed and people were being taken," says Vicky Oelze.

Who else would attempt to fill in the gaps of the transatlantic slave trade by gathering clues from cemeteries in South Carolina and the shores of West Africa?</p>
<p>Four hundred years after the forced displacement of millions of Africans began, Oelze wants to use isotope biogeochemistry to trace back and identify the origins of individuals who were abducted and perished in the Americas.</p>
<p>Skeletal remains of slaves hold the clues that Oelze will use to identify where in Africa individuals were born and raised&#8212;information that has been lost to history.</p>
<p>"The narrative we have now is based on log books written by people who were deporting hundreds of Africans on ships," said Oelze. "They documented only the numbers&#8212;how many left and how many arrived in the respective harbors. There was no recordkeeping of where people were actually from."</p>
<p>Archaeologists have had great success in parts of the developed Western world using strontium isotopes to identify the geological origin of prehistoric people, matching data to detailed strontium isotope maps researchers have developed. This type of map does not exist for tropical Africa, a gap Oelze will fill with over 400 environmental samples from 40 field sites that cover most major geological formations in tropical Africa. The principle is simple: Vegetation takes up a specific isotopic makeup of the trace element strontium from bedrock, and, in tiny quantities, that isotopic "signature" becomes locked in the teeth of people and animals that consume it. Oelze will use samples of African flora and fauna to build a strontium isotope map to match the signatures in skeletal remains of slaves to specific regions in Africa.</p>
<p>With support from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation, Oelze is hiring a postdoctoral researcher for two years to work in partnership with collaborators at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. In a second step, the team will start examining human remains from the Americas for their strontium isotope values. Strontium isotope analysis is particularly valuable when deterioration of skeletal material has ruled out genetic analyses as an option, and it is a much more precise way to assess human mobility on an individual, rather than population, level, said Oelze. The team will also analyze human remains from urban centers of the West African slave trade in collaboration with UCSC archaeologist Cameron Monroe.</p>
<p>"We know villages were destroyed and people were being taken," said Oelze. "We want to put numbers on it. I'm interested in individual histories."</p>
<p>The remains of millions of slaves are buried in designated slave cemeteries and near slave trade centers in the Caribbean and the Americas, as well as in informal burial plots that have been lost to history, noted Oelze. "It is imperative to include descendant communities in the process,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Many have a genuine interest in their ancestors. It's important to them, which is why so many are turning to 23andMe."</p>
<p>However, genetics from Africa are postcolonial and therefore flawed, said Oelze. As people were displaced by the pressures of slave raids, they effectively erased their geographic origins; strontium isotope analysis holds the promise of retracing movements from the past, she said.</p>
<p>Oelze's results will also aid wildlife conservation. "Trafficking of endangered animals is of growing concern to conservation, and this map of strontium isotopes in tropical Africa will help identify hotspots of illegal poaching activity," said Oelze, who plans to share her data internationally in open-access publications. She is also eager to use the findings to spark interest in STEM fields among students from Historically Black Colleges and from high schools with diverse student populations.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>A hub of excellence</strong></p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has the potential to lead the field in tracing the histories, geographies, and molecular archaeology of the slave trade, according to Katharyne Mitchell, dean of the Division of Social Sciences. In Anthropology, Lars Fehren-Schmitz brings expertise in the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/11/fehrenschmitz-dna.html">analysis of ancient DNA</a>, and Monroe has conducted <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2011/09/monroe.html">extensive research</a> in B&#233;nin and Togo on the transformation of West African communities during the slave trade, as well as related archaeological research in the Caribbean. In History, Professor Greg O'Malley has done <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/05/greg-omalley-slavetrade.html">pathbreaking work</a> on the transatlantic slave trade.</p>

Who in the black community, in higher ed, inspires you?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter Blair Henry. He is the Dean Emeritus of New York University's Stern School of Business and was dean for much of the time that I worked at NYU. He graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a degree in Economics earned with distinction and highest honors. A Rhodes Scholar, he graduated from Oxford with a degree in mathematics and earned his PhD in economics from MIT. He was on President Obama&#8217;s Transition Council for Economics and the first black dean at NYU&#8217;s Business School. Most important, Peter is a devoted husband and a father of four boys. Because he was born in Jamaica, I suspect Peter&#8217;s perspective was not just influenced by the racism evident in the US, but also by the remnants of colonialism still at play in the Carribean.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter inspires me because when I think of an inclusive leader, I think of him. Business schools are still largely homogenous places and their leadership team and boards typically reflect that homogeneity. During his time at NYU he built a very gender diverse leadership team and cultivated a more diverse board. He handled every situation with a sense of humor, a sense of humility, and a sense of welcomeness that allowed people the space to be human and make mistakes. For someone who has accomplished so much, I&#8217;ve found this to be incredibly inspiring. In practicing this approach, I&#8217;ve found that it allows people to feel comfortable and it helps me to establish relationships built on shared humanity. Peter has inspired me to be a better leader who is purposeful about inclusivity, intentional about creating diversity and thoughtful in my flexibility and judgment. I am in admiration of the positive impact he has made on so many people and I aspire to pay it forward.</span></p>
<p><strong>As an African American, what has been your experience throughout your career, working in the IT field?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My experience has been one that&#8217;s full of connections and relationships. I&#8217;ve been fortunate to be surrounded by friends and professionals who have mentored and sponsored me at a very young age within the technology field. They&#8217;ve taught me not just how to navigate the field of technology but also the fields of business and higher ed. I&#8217;ve learned that leadership and followership are both situational. In order to affect change you need to be flexible and to embrace and leverage your intersectionality to build bridges out rather than walls up. It was really a benefit for me working in higher ed in New York City because not only is there a large black caribbean community, there is every community imaginable. Despite the huge amount of diversity and dynamism in NYC, I always felt like I belonged. Working there for over 18 years gave me the opportunity to work closely with and interact daily with people from all different socioeconomic classes, races, ages and educational strata. That helped to dramatically build both my technical and people skills because I had things to learn from everyone. Without the confidence and the inspiration of being around the amazing people that I saw everyday, I don&#8217;t think I would have aspired for more in my career. The experience, skillset and confidence has been incredibly helpful in adjusting to my current role as vice chancellor of information technology at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve been a Banana Slug for a year and a half now. Compared to other places you&#8217;ve worked and lived, what are some key differences?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the obvious one is that Santa Cruz has a very different demographic makeup than New York City. In all honesty, there are not yet a whole lot of people here that look like me, especially in leadership roles. However, there is still the same shared community built around excellence and passion for learning. The sense of intellectual curiosity has been a bridge-builder for me as I am surrounded by a group of fascinating colleagues who have been very willing to share their knowledge and experiences. At UCSC, there is a much greater commitment to global social impact than any other organization I&#8217;ve been a part of. We care about social justice, the environment, health, social entrepreneurship, diversity, equity and inclusion. UCSC is the type of place in which every day I think, &#8220;What does our campus need to do in order to create the level of diversity our students need?&#8221; and I look around and realize there are a whole bunch of colleagues thinking the exact same thing. We all care a lot about having the campus reflect the population that we are part of, whether that be Women, Latinx, Black, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders or something else. At the forefront of my divisional leadership conversations is ensuring that our ITS organization contributes to moving the needle in every way we can. We are willing to experiment, whether it&#8217;s through how we think about and support our student employees, how we recruit our staff, or looking for ways to make space to have meaningful impacts. What&#8217;s different about UCSC and very exciting, is just how much these things are a part of every conversation throughout our campus.</span></p>
<p><strong>As the UC Santa Cruz Chief Information Officer, you lead a big IT organization. What are you doing for diversity?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just came from a workshop with other ITS colleagues about implicit bias and microaggressions in the workplace, so this is fresh on my mind right now. I spent much of winter break reading and trying to understand diversity in all senses. My book of the month is by a former colleague of mine, Dolly Chugh. It&#8217;s called, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Person You Mean to Be: How Good People Fight Bias</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I&#8217;ve gifted it to my leadership team so we all spend some time identifying and understanding our own biases to better support diversity and inclusiveness within our ITS organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently I wrote a recap for my weekly newsletter to ITS staff of all the things we&#8217;ve done thus far to support diversity, equity and inclusion: Everything from discussions, workshops, trying to change business processes, to making sure our hiring managers have the opportunity to obtain a diverse pool of candidates. In addition, I&#8217;ve reinstated the Diversity &amp; Inclusion Group for ITS (DIG-IT) that aims to build and foster a diverse and inclusive culture within ITS by advocating and cultivating deeper appreciation of our diverse community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I recognize there is so much more we still need to do. One of the big ones I am focusing on now is looking at how we build into our processes ways to account for our own biases and bring those to the surface so we can start having conversations to help counter the negative impacts bias can have.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>What do you think UC Santa Cruz, or the University of California, can do to attract potential Black students or employees to come here?&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the first thing we need to do is build out a better support network for students to be successful. That means access to people that are like them, and in some cases it&#8217;s being able to provide funding. We&#8217;re pulling in first-generation students who, many times, have a lot of challenges and need financial aid. They need access to resources to be successful, but need to be given access to them in a way that is not stigmatizing.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second thing we need to do is share our student stories. We need to highlight their successes, either as students or alumni. If they are able to share their UC experience, then maybe more potential students will say, &#8220;Hey, it is possible for me to be successful in that role too.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the above is in place, the third thing is being really conscious about targeting the places where these students are and getting the right role models in front of them. We also need to make sure that when we get them to our campus they have the right level of resources and community support.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Do you have a comment for the UC IT community, in general, about diversity and the future?&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think all of us, whether we are underrepresented minorities or not, need to look for opportunities to serve as sponsors and mentors. Individual relationships are a huge breaker of barriers across groups of all sorts. If we are able to sponsor and mentor people that are not like us and start advocating for them, then we can begin to stop othering different groups. Instead we start seeing them as a collection of individuals. I&#8217;d love to see that systematized across UC. I&#8217;d love to build a way where individual performance reviews, unit performance reviews, and incentives are actually aligned with participating in these types of relationships and network building. I&#8217;d like to see all chancellors asking their leadership teams, &#8220;What kind of system do you have in place to support that?&#8221; and &#8220;What are you doing to make those systems better?&#8221;. I think from a faculty, staff and student perspective, that will make a profound difference. Just being able to have one meaningful relationship gives a person a much greater sense of belonging. I strongly believe that a sense of belonging is critical to our students ability to be successful and our colleagues ability to be engaged in their jobs.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="459a51e680727017465caccecf19950d"><name>electioneering-on-campus</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Electioneering on campus</title><summary>The next primary election is a little less than a month away.

<p><i><strong>Election season also brings robust campaigning</strong></i></p>
<p>While we are glad to see our community is engaged with the various contests and topics, I want to remind everyone that there are legal restrictions on University of California involvement in political campaign activities based on the status of the university as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization and as a state entity.</p>
<p>Specifically, the university may not endorse/oppose (or contribute to) political candidates, nor may university resources (including university-paid time or equipment) be used for campaign purposes in connection with ballot propositions or measures.</p>
<p>While it is important to ensure that voters are informed and engaged, it is also important to abide by University of California policies around the appropriate rules of &#8220;time, place, and manner.&#8221; We want to ensure fairness in our elections processes and that we are not using state resources or facilities for campaign purposes and that information is presented in a balanced manner.</p>
<p>To this end, state law and University policies (<a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/student-conduct/student-handbook/pdf/30.0-policy-speech-advocacy.pdf"><span class="gmail-s2">Policy on Speech and Advocacy</span></a> and <a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/student-conduct/student-handbo"><span class="gmail-s2">Policy on use of university properties</span></a>), provide guidelines on how and where campaign materials may<span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space">&#160; </span>be posted on campus. Please also note that those wishing to post materials at certain locations must check with that location to ensure compliance with the posting rules and procedures of the particular location.</p>
<p>Organizations and individuals not affiliated with the university must also comply with the <a href="https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/3000127/NonA"><span class="gmail-s2">Regulations Governing Conduct of Non-Affiliates in the Buildings and on the Grounds of the University of California</span></a> and may post and distribute materials only on bulletin boards designated for public use: outdoor kiosks and the interior of bus shelters.

<p>Dear Faculty, Staff and Students:</p>
<p>The University of California respects its labor unions and its unionized workers. They provide valuable services throughout the University, from gardening and food service on our campuses to patient care in our hospitals to lecturers in our classrooms. The obligations between the University and its unions are negotiated and memorialized systemwide in collective bargaining agreements, which must be voted on and ratified by the union membership. With respect to the collective bargaining agreement between the University and Academic Student Employee -Teaching Assistants (TAs) and their union, the United Auto Workers (UAW), the TAs received the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>A waiver of tuition, plus a $300 campus fee remission</li>
<li>3% annual wage increases (in line with other University employees)</li>
<li>A child care subsidy of $3,300 per year (unique to TAs)</li>
<li>A one-time signing bonus</li>
<li>A complete remission of any health care premiums</li>
</ul>
<p>In exchange for these guaranteed benefits, the University received a contractual promise that the TAs would not strike while the collective bargaining agreement was in effect through June 30, 2022.</p>
<p>Consequently, the wildcat strike by UC Santa Cruz TAs, where a number of TAs have withheld or deleted fall grades and are refusing to teach classes, is unauthorized and in direct violation of the existing collective bargaining agreement. The striking TAs have asked whether the University would either re-open the agreement or negotiate a separate side letter with them to provide a Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) over and above the wage increase already in the agreement to account for the high cost of housing in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The University will not re-open the agreement or negotiate a separate side-letter. To accede to the demands of a group of employees engaged in an unauthorized wildcat strike would undercut the very foundation of an agreement negotiated in good faith by the UAW and ratified by thousands of members across the system.</p>
<p>We are sympathetic to the high cost of housing in Santa Cruz and the pressure this puts on TAs, but a wildcat strike is not the way to get relief. Chancellor Larive has already proposed two measures to help graduate students: a $2,500 need-based housing fellowship; and for doctoral students a 5-year, funding program at the minimum support level of a 50 percent teaching assistantship. We can work together to persuade our legislators in Sacramento to support the University&#8217;s request for more graduate student support. We could also work together to develop other legislative proposals to speed the construction of student housing.</p>
<p>However, holding undergraduate grades hostage and refusing to carry out contracted teaching responsibilities is the wrong way to go. Therefore, participation in the wildcat strike will have consequences, up to and including the termination of existing employment at the University.</p>
<p>It should not come to this. We urge the striking TAs to turn in their grades and return to the classroom. The TAs must honor their side of the bargain, just as the University must honor its commitments. The wildcat strike must come to an end.</p>
<p>Yours very truly,</p>
<p>Janet Napolitano<br/>President</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4b98b35980727017465cacce0d56a8f7"><name>cpevc-graduate-student-strike-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Graduate student strike update</title><summary>Interim Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer provides an update on the campus's work to bring the unsanctioned strike by some graduate students to an end. </summary><start-date>1581667200000</start-date><display-name>Graduate student strike update</display-name><path>/2020/02/cpevc-graduate-student-strike-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/02/cpevc-graduate-student-strike-update</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1581816263480</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1582835369326</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Over my nearly 28 years of affiliation with UC Santa Cruz, I have never lost the inspiration I feel over the promise and potential of this campus, the accomplishments of our faculty, and our collective dedication to the teaching, research, and public service mission. The grading, and now teaching, strike disrupts our educational mission and imposes costs on students, particularly our undergraduate students. At this difficult moment for our campus, we may disagree about tactics and approach; however, we all agree that the motivating issues are real and felt by many.</p>
<p>The housing crisis is complex, systemic, and at the same time, deeply personal for many. There are no easy answers and in so many ways it is a challenge that is larger than our community. We have struggled with this challenge almost as long as I have been on this campus, at times with more success than others.</p>
<p>Where we differ, however, is in the approach to solve this problem. Our graduate student instructors and teaching assistants have chosen to ignore their own union and to strike, demanding a significant increase to their existing, union-negotiated compensation package, an increase that they have characterized as a cost of living adjustment.</p>
<p>Recognizing the short-term challenge to housing, Chancellor Larive announced two new programs to provide doctoral and MFA students with greater financial security and predictability, at a cost of approximately $7 million per year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beginning in fall 2020, we will offer new and continuing doctoral students support packages for five years (two years for MFA students). These packages will have a minimum level of support equivalent to that of a 50 percent teaching assistantship.</li>
<li>Second, until more graduate student housing becomes available, an annual housing supplement of $2,500 for doctoral and MFA students offered through the Graduate Division.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite this overture that provides significant improvement in financial support, the grading strike did not come to an end, but escalated to a full teaching strike. And while I understand the drivers, I do not support the approach. Moreover, and more importantly, the approach taken by our striking graduate student employees is having a significant negative impact on the emotional well-being and academic success of our undergraduate students, our dedicated staff who have gone above and beyond to mitigate the consequences, and the very mission of our campus.</p>
<p>I have met with graduate student activists on several occasions to explore ways in which we could have a substantive conversation and discuss how we can support them beyond the programs that we have already announced and which, I believe, substantially improves their financial security and ability to plan.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, our students continue to strike. They continue to refuse to provide grade information for the fall quarter. And they continue to interrupt the very programs that change the lives of our undergraduate students. Given this unwillingness to de-escalate and come together, I share with you here a difficult next step that our campus must take.</p>
<p>Today, all students who have continued to withhold fall grades will be informed that they have until 11:59 p.m. on Friday, February 21 to submit all missing grades, to end the strike and to fulfill their contractual obligations. We are giving these students one final opportunity to fulfill their teaching responsibilities and show that they can fulfill future responsibilities. Those who do not submit full grade information by February 21 will not receive spring quarter appointments or will be dismissed from their spring quarter appointments.</p>
<p>As faculty members, I urge you to speak with your TAs and advisees and encourage them to stop their unsanctioned strike and to submit the missing grades. I understand the close bond you have with your students, the promise they represent as scholars and practitioners, the vital role they play in supporting our educational mission, and I hope you will be able to discuss with them that returning to work is in their own personal and professional interests and is in the best interests of all our students. I acknowledge and thank you for supporting our students and engaging in what are very difficult conversations.</p>
<p>This is not a step we have taken lightly. Contingency plans will be developed to mitigate the issues this will create once we understand who has returned to work and who has not. I understand that this is going to result in challenges but believe at this point, it is our best option.</p>
<p>I trust soon we can get back to our shared academic purpose&#8212;teaching and research. I sincerely hope that most, if not all, of our TAs decide to re-join us in this vital endeavor.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Faculty</audience><admin>Interim Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="59f85f8480727017465cacced5a0320b"><name>parker-art-algae</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Art professor’s exhibition in Spain addresses algae and climate change</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz art professor Jennifer Parker believes that algae are an “unsung hero of the planet”--noting that these photosynthetic organisms produce one half of the total global oxygen, while absorbing one third of the carbon dioxide produced worldwide...</summary><keywords>algae, uc santa cruz news, ucsc news, ucsc arts research, climate change, global warming </keywords><start-date>1582060500000</start-date><display-name>Parker: art-algae-climate </display-name><path>/2020/02/parker-art-algae</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/02/parker-art-algae</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1582057414499</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1582063235170</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Art</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Research</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>International</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><br/><iframe allow="autoplay;

As an artist, Parker is interested in influencing the next generation to learn more about the environment and to actively help reduce the human impact on ecosystems.<br/> <br/>Parker recently returned from Complutense University of Madrid, where she put together an exhibition in collaboration with one of her former students, Jose Carlos Espinel, who is now employed there as a professor. Titled <em>Drift and Migrate</em>, it was the first exhibition by the Algae Society in Spain.<br/> <br/>Designed to show the impact of human activity and global warming on the marine environment, the show included graphic works, photographs, interactive exhibits, audiovisual installations, and sculpture from more than 50 artists from different parts of the world.<br/> <br/>&#8220;It is often surprising for people to learn what algae is,&#8221; Parker noted. &#8220;For instance, most people don&#8217;t necessarily know that giant sea kelp is algae. The topics covered in the exhibition range from plastics in the ocean to acidification of the ocean, and the effects that has on different species like coral and sea turtles, which are both vulnerable to extinction.&#8221; <br/> <br/>&#8220;The main focus however is phytoplankton as the very bottom of the food chain and integral to the earth&#8217;s climate as they absorb carbon dioxide,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Warming oceans contribute to less oxygen, which make for less phytoplankton in some cases or in others, depending on which type of phytoplankton, it can cause a bloom. Both critically influence marine eco-systems--less food for fish as the plankton migrate to cooler patches of the ocean and more carbon dioxide make the ocean acidic, ultimately altering the global climate.&#8221;<br/> <br/>Parker described the impact that collaborative artistic and educational projects like the Madrid exhibition can have on fighting (or adapting) to climate change.<br/> <br/>&#8220;In a paper just published by David Roberts in <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/1/29/21083250/climate-change-social-tipping-points"><em><strong>Vox</strong></em></a> about the social tipping point for climate change and the things that &#8216;tip that point&#8217;, the education system is listed as one of the systems that must change to address climate change,&#8221; said Parker. &#8220;The Algae Society is formed by educators who are actively engaged in teaching&#8212;it's part of our formula to help better understand the role of human activity on species living on the planet.&#8221; <br/> <br/>She added that The Algae Society will continue to expand its network in an effort to engage different regions and try different types of outreach opportunities.<br/> <br/>&#8220;The ultimate goal/dream would be to have individuals around the globe shift their thinking of being extractors of the planet&#8217;s resources, or protectors of earth, to being collaborators with the earth as an equal partner and living in a symbiotic relationship,&#8221; said Parker.<br/> <br/>&#8220;Practically speaking, we&#8217;d have cities around the world putting together Algae Society exhibits that share not only the role of how algae, at both the macro and micro level, behave in different ecosystems, but also share the beauty and wonder of these organisms and how cohabitation of the planet is vital to human survival.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5aa0895980727017465cacceb8ffb58d"><name>antarctic-whales</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Researchers get a ‘whale’s-eye view’ of Antarctic sea ice </title><summary>Cameras attached to a rare species of Antarctic whale are giving scientists an unprecedented view of how the whales survive in their sea ice habitat.</summary><keywords>Ari Friedlaender, Jacob Linsky</keywords><start-date>1582128000000</start-date><display-name>Researchers get a ‘whale’s-eye view’ of Antarctic sea ice </display-name><path>/2020/02/antarctic-whales</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/02/antarctic-whales</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1582068435261</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1582127911342</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Lauren Lipuma, AGU</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><br/><iframe allow="accelerometer;

<p>In a recent study, scientists attached tags to 30 Antarctic minke whales, a small and little-known species of baleen whale, to better understand the animals&#8217; sea ice environment. The tags, clinging to the animals&#8217; backs with suction cups, recorded video and motion data for 24 to 48 hours.</p>
<p>Each time the whales surfaced, the researchers could calculate from the video how much sea ice was present, providing clues as to how the amount and type of sea ice influenced the whales&#8217; behavior.</p>
<p>Previous research had relied on satellite images to study the whales&#8217; habitat, but scientists needed to get closer to truly understand how these creatures were moving through their sea ice environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unique in that we&#8217;ve never been able to measure this kind of an environmental feature from the animal&#8217;s perspective,&#8221; said Ari Friedlaender, an ecologist at UC Santa Cruz who led the project. &#8220;These tags have the capacity to continuously show us the environment the animal is experiencing, which is absolutely novel for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the research is still ongoing, preliminary data from the whale cams are already revealing surprising results, according to the researchers. From the six tags analyzed so far, the researchers saw whales were spending 52 percent of their time in open water compared to just 15 percent in water with high concentrations of sea ice.</p>
<p>As Antarctic sea ice continues to shrink under climate change, understanding its importance for the whales will be crucial for protecting them, according to the researchers.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of [previous work] with these cameras has been focused on animal behavior, which was originally one of the intentions that we had for our cameras,&#8221; said Jacob Linsky, a research technician at UC Santa Cruz who helped develop the new technique. &#8220;But we happen to have stumbled upon a great way to monitor the environment with this mobile platform, which is something that hasn't been done in the marine environment before.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the tagged minke whales swam and dived under the ice, the scientists also learned new things about the cryptic species and its behavior. The piggybacking cameras allowed scientists a whale&#8217;s-eye view of a day in the life of an Antarctic minke&#8212;its feeding habits, social life, and where it spent the most time.</p>
<p>Linsky is presenting the team&#8217;s findings in a talk on Friday, February 21, at the Ocean Sciences Meeting in San Diego.</p>
<p>As the researchers evaluate more of the tags, they will be able to tell whether minke whales prefer to forage in areas with more or less sea ice. This will help scientists determine the species&#8217; ecological role&#8212;and how to best protect it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I'm most interested in is learning as much as we can about the behavior and the needs of these animals so that we can better understand the impact that climate change has on them,&#8221; Friedlaender said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5f9dc73380727017465cacce46054677"><name>jacobmartinezleadership</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Digital NEST founder receives distinguished award for leadership and vision</title><summary>The James Irvine Foundation is honoring the visionary Digital NEST founder Jacob Martinez for providing workforce training and high tech skills for youth in underserved rural areas.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jacob Martinez (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakes '04, evolutionary biology), founder and executive director of Digital NEST, has received a prestigious 2020 James Irvine Leadership Award for empowering youth through digital innovation.&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Martinez opened Digital NEST, a hip and innovative learning center, in Watsonville six years ago. The nonprofit helps young people from rural areas master skills like programming, game design, filmmaking, and graphic arts. It also guides them as they create their own projects.</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The leadership awards r</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ecognize and support individuals who are advancing innovative and effective solutions to significant economic and social issues in California. The foundation provides each recipient&#8217;s organization with a grant of $250,000 to support his or her work benefiting the people of California, and helps recipients share their approaches with policymakers and practitioners. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The foundation hailed Martinez as &#8220;a leader in the fight against social, educational, and economic inequities in the underserved rural communities of Northern California.&#8221; The foundation also praised Martinez for his work on behalf of&#160; &#8220;forgotten communities&#8221; that have been historically locked out of the economic opportunities and digital innovation brought by the technology industry.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the foundation noted, some of those families have been pushed out of their own neighborhoods as a side effect of a booming digital economy.&#160;</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are youth in forgotten communities across this state that have the heart, skills, and talent needed to drive California&#8217;s future,&#8221; Martinez said.&#160; <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview, he mentioned that Watsonville is only an hour's drive south of Silicon Valley. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why are these companies continuously looking for talent in other parts of this country when there is brilliant, young, and diverse talent that exists right outside their corporate headquarters?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital NEST creates physical tech hubs for youth, giving them places to go for training, education, and access to technology. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last 5 years, over 2,500 youth have gone to the Digital NEST for services training. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have students coming here during the high school day, getting elective credit, but also getting workforce training at the same time,&#8221; Martinez said. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Martinez launched a partnership with a local school district and community college to integrate technology curricula for K-12 and higher education institutions. This program allows students to receive both high school and college credits for specific technology classes.

"</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>$2 million gift will support programs, improve facilities</article-subhead><article-text><p>Jessica Correa has loved insects since she was a little girl, when she kept ladybugs as pets and was fascinated by ants.</p>
<p>But it wasn't until she enrolled in the <a href="https://nhfq.ucsc.edu/">Natural History Field Quarter</a> class in Spring 2018 that she really&#8212;<em>really</em>&#8212;looked at insects. That 15-unit course, made up of field trips to UC Natural Reserves around the state, immersed Correa in the natural world. She honed her skills of observation, exploration, and inquiry as she learned about plants, animals, birds, geology, land management, and more.</p>
<p>"Field Quarter changed everything, not just academically," said Correa, who graduated last June with a double major in environmental studies and sociology. "Before, I tended to dwell on minor life problems and was not awake to the beauty surrounding me. After that class, I started looking around and appreciating everything&#8212;all the trees, the color of the sky, how beautiful it all is. It changed the way I go about life."</p>
<p>It also set Correa on a career path as an environmental educator. Today she is an instructor with the <a href="https://www.birdschoolproject.org/">Bird School Project</a>, a Santa Cruz-based nonprofit launched by two UCSC graduates who teach middle-school students about birds on their school grounds to help them develop the skills of a naturalist.</p>
<p>For Correa, the bridge between that immersive class and where she is today was the <a href="https://norriscenter.ucsc.edu/">Kenneth S. Norris Center for Natural History</a>. Located in Natural Sciences 2, the Norris Center is part classroom, part working museum, and part community hub. It supports natural history education and research, hosts classes and workshops, supports internships and fellowships, and is home to an impressive collection of specimens, including birds, butterflies, plants, and mammals.</p>
<p>Built on the legacy of Ken Norris, the center's mission is to educate and empower stewards of the natural world. Formerly known as the Museum of Natural History Collections at UCSC, the center was named after Norris, a beloved professor of environmental studies, in 2015 and is poised to greatly expand its programs and reach thanks to an anonymous $2 million gift.</p>
<p>"We've gone from the basement of what's now Baskin Engineering, where we reached maybe 50 to 100 people a year, to reaching 2,000 students a year&#8212;or more," said Chris Lay, director of the Norris Center since 2008.</p>
<p>The gift comes at an auspicious moment, providing the security the center needed to scale up its programs and operations. The funds will enable the center to improve its facilities, offer more paid internships and research opportunities for undergraduates, support one or two graduate students per year who will mentor undergraduates, hire a full-time collections manager, grow its successful art-science initiative, expand teaching and leadership training, and build its alumni network.</p>
<p>Environmental Studies Professor Karen Holl, the faculty director of the Norris Center, is delighted that the gift will infuse every area that supports students, from introductory classes to post-graduation career support. "I'm so grateful for this recent large gift, as well as to the many donors to the Norris Center who enable us to not only expand the programs we offer now, but to grow our endowment so we know that we can continue to offer them for years to come," she said.</p>
<p><u>"A naturalist on every street"</u></p>
<p>Lay, who has watched natural history change the lives of countless students like Correa, can barely contain himself when he talks about the future.</p>
<p>"We're reaching many people, but we can reach many, many more," he said. "I want to put a naturalist on every street and in every meeting. I want them out there advocating for the natural world and inspiring others to be stewards of local places and beyond. It seems of the utmost importance to do it now."</p>
<p>Last fall, Lay took a big step in that direction when he partnered with Campus Natural Reserve Director Alex Jones to participate in the Merrill College and Rachel Carson College core courses. Lay, Jones, and a corps of 11 undergraduate mentors conducted field trainings with 660 frosh, introducing them to observation and inquiry just outside their classrooms.</p>
<p>"We took them into the redwoods and encouraged them to make observations, think critically about a puzzle they discovered, and support their own explanations with evidence they can observe,&#8221; explained Lay, a veteran natural history instructor.</p>
<p>One group was curious about the rings of young redwoods that grow around big, fire-damaged stumps on UCSC&#8217;s upper campus. Student mentors facilitated discussions&#8212;with a firm emphasis on exploration and inquiry, not on simply reciting answers.</p>
<p>"We're inspiring them to be curious," explained Lay. "They ask genius questions, things I've never thought of before. They develop their own hypotheses, and we help them find clever ways to gather evidence that supports their ideas. It's a magical process where we get to investigate alongside students. It's not top-down. It's a collaborative version of the scientific method."</p>
<p>The lessons learned in the forest have value for every student embarking on their college career, regardless of discipline, said Lay. "The world is complex, and nature is complex," he said. "You have to develop multiple hypotheses. You need to stay open to new ideas, new evidence. One thing you learn as a naturalist is to be humble."</p>
<p><u>Springboard to opportunity</u></p>
<p>For students like Jessica Correa, the Norris Center can be a springboard to opportunity.</p>
<p>"Jessica is amazing," said Lay. "She came to us wanting to learn this stuff, and she was a very conscientious, hard-working student. She did everything&#8212;independent research, internships, a senior project. She produced a <a href="https://randallmorganinitiative.ucsc.edu/data-and-research/images/correa-syrphidguide.pdf">field guide</a> to an overlooked but very important fly pollinator group. She got so good we hired her to lead surveys of other insects."</p>
<p>After Correa graduated in June, Lay kept in touch. He recently met with her to discuss options for graduate school and to provide tips on additional hands-on experiences that will make her application&#8212;whether for school or work&#8212;stand out. That level of post-graduation support builds on what the Norris Center offers students, and Lay is eager to bolster his efforts by building the alumni network so students and graduates can support each other. "The only thing I do on Facebook is post jobs," he said, laughing.</p>
<p>Correa welcomed the brainstorming and the networking support.</p>
<p>"It's all about the ripple effect," she said. "A lot of it is word of mouth. People get interested, and they start talking. It's a cycle of good networking."</p>
<p>Correa is making her own ripples through the Bird School Project. This spring, she will offer the school's first Spanish-language instruction to students at a Salinas middle school.</p>
<p>Correa is hooked on environmental education. "When you ignite the curiosity, you ignite the love, and when you have the love, you ignite caring," said Correa. "It feels whimsical talking about it, but I see it in the faces of kids. It makes me feel good."</p>
<p>She has another reason for staying in touch with the Norris Center: She remembers being the only Latina, and one of only three students of color, in the Natural History Field Quarter class&#8212;a group of 25 undergraduates.</p>
<p>"Initially, it was a huge culture shock," she said. "I love the Norris Center, and I love Environmental Studies, but it's really white. It can be intimidating if you're not familiar with your surroundings. If you see somebody else that looks like you, you say, 'Maybe this is a place for me.' It makes it more accessible to anybody. And I don't mean just students of color. I'm talking about sexual identity, academic major, everything."</p>
<p>Outreach and inclusion are top priorities for the center, and Correa's ongoing connection to the center is the type of affiliation Lay hopes to instill in students.</p>

<p>Thank you, Chair Lau, and thanks to each of you for the opportunity to meet today. A lot has happened since I first had the chance to address this group in November. I had hoped that I would be standing before you today outlining initiatives and concrete steps that we are taking in partnership to solidify our status as a research leader, to promote student success, to streamline our organizations and processes, and to cultivate an inclusive campus climate. Instead, today we will be discussing strikes, policing, discipline, and behavior that is undermining the very mission of our campus.</p>
<p><em>In Santa Cruz we have a housing crisis; this is not new information.</em> It&#8217;s a problem our community has been wrestling with long before I stepped foot on this campus.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s new? Why now? There hasn&#8217;t been a dramatic change over the past year in this situation. Some data show rents increasing by 1 percent, other data show prices have actually gone down, but still as many in our community experience, affordable housing in Santa Cruz is a challenge. On the other hand, we haven&#8217;t seen a decrease in the wages of our striking workers &#8212; in fact, in line with their negotiated contract, there has actually been a 3 percent increase in salary. Yet suddenly our graduate students are demanding an almost 60 percent increase in their pay. Think about that. A 60 percent increase.</p>
<p>U.S. News has said that our campus is second only to Riverside nationally in advancing student social mobility. This is an impressive distinction, a recognition that I know makes us all extremely proud. So, I ask you, what has changed so dramatically that our graduate student teaching assistants have taken the step to hold hostage grades and withhold teaching from some of the most vulnerable among us? I think we all know the answer to this. They sensed that with new leadership comes new opportunity.</p>
<p><em>In Santa Cruz we have a housing crisis.</em> I sympathize with our community &#8212; rental prices are high and housing stock is low. Housing here is some of the most expensive in the UC system, yet we are absolutely rock bottom in the number of graduate student housing units we have available. Again, this is not new information. But we DO have new leadership.</p>
<p>We all understand the problem. Where we disagree is how to address it. My team has been working behind the scenes since I arrived to explore both short- and long-term solutions to address this crisis. In early-December we were finalizing programs that we hoped would provide some relief. But then our students chose, without warning, to strike &#8212; to withhold grades from our undergraduate students just as they were preparing to head home for the holidays.</p>
<p>This action &#8212; unsanctioned and unapproved by their own union &#8212; had serious and perhaps unintended consequences, not the least of which was delaying the programs that we had in development. My team immediately needed to shift to firefighting mode &#8212; to jump into action to minimize the impact of these actions on our undergraduate students. This work and this action continues today.</p>
<p>But this strike is shortsighted in other ways that we haven&#8217;t really discussed. Wildcat strikes by their very nature undermine worker protections. Any quick win would come at the expense of every single union worker not just on our campus but throughout the UC system by undermining the very foundation of collective bargaining. As President Napolitano made eminently clear last week, this is a step that neither she nor I are prepared to take.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I want to make sure that you all clearly understand my position. While I cannot and will not take action to open a negotiated systemwide contract to meet demands for a 60 percent increase in salary &#8212; I can and I do have ways to help provide relief as we explore longer-term solutions. While I faced some resistance, in January, I committed the campus to provide $7 million annually to launch, two new programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is a program that guarantees five-years of support for new and continuing doctoral students with a minimum level of support equivalent to that of a 50 percent teaching assistantship. The same level of support is being offered to our MFA students for two years.</li>
<li>The second, until more graduate student housing becomes available, provides a need-based, annual housing supplement of $2,500 for doctoral and MFA students offered through a partnership between the Financial Aid Office and the Graduate Division.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together, these programs provide our doctoral and MFA students with the greater financial security and a predictability that has been missing for many of them.</p>
<p>I had hoped that by proactively making this overture, our grad students would understand that I wasn&#8217;t playing games. That I truly value and support their contributions to our community. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed when they responded not by ending their grade strike but by escalating it to full teaching strike.</p>
<p>I want to just take a pause here to ensure that I am clear when I talk about this wildcat strike. We have 91 percent of Fall grades in the system. We have graduate students across the campus who continue to help educate our undergraduates. These strikers are not representative of the majority of our graduate students by any means, but are, instead, a committed, vocal group. My team has met with graduate student leaders &#8212; not in the context of our labor contract but as students, as members of our community, as individuals. To date we&#8217;ve met four times with student leaders. We&#8217;ve been supported in this effort by several of you on the faculty and for that, I thank you.</p>
<p><em>In Santa Cruz we have a housing crisis, this is not new information.</em> But tackling this entrenched, systemic issue is going to take time and creative solutions. We cannot get there by action that puts at risk the safety, security and the very mission of our campus. Like you, I do not want to see or spend our limited budget on a large police presence on campus. But I am duty bound as chancellor to provide a safe environment for our students, our community, and yes our protestors &#8212; to ensure that we protect free expression while protecting our community as they attend classes, go to doctors&#8217; appointments, and take their children to school.</p>
<p>I am committed to our students, to our community and to our mission. I am committed to tackling difficult issues and finding solutions to the challenges that we face. But this requires partnership, creative thinking, and commitment by me, by you the faculty, and by our students.</p>
<p>I am pleased to share that EVC Lori Kletzer, Graduate Dean Quentin Williams and I in consultation with the Graduate Council have agreed to establish a working group that will develop a comprehensive, realistic and actionable plan for strengthening graduate education. And while this is an important step for our campus, we must also have a mechanism of advancing productive, collaborative and sustained conversations with a broader group of stakeholders.</p>
<p>To open up a venue for that conversation, I will take the first step here today by announcing that I am creating the Chancellor&#8217;s Advisory Committee on Graduate Education &#8212; a standing group of graduate students and faculty representatives charged with examining and making recommendations related to graduate-student support. Together, these two groups will help to guide our campus as we chart a new course.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a long-term buyer. I&#8217;m bullish on Santa Cruz. There are great things that we can accomplish together. Won&#8217;t you join me?</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="650d6d7080727017465cacce06c5b1b7"><name>benner-network</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1685125798727</last-published-on><last-published-by>asoergel</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz joins national "tech for social good" network </title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has been accepted into a new national network of colleges and universities that have made an explicit commitment to developing technology that will advance the public interest. &#13;

<p>UC Santa Cruz is one of 15 institutions that are joining the network this month, bringing to 36 the total since the network launched in 2018. UC Santa Cruz and UC Berkeley are the only UC campuses represented in the network.</p>
<p>Benner, as director of the <a href="https://santacruzinstitute.ucsc.edu/">Institute for Social Transformation</a>, partnered with Michael Matkin, assistant director of <a href="https://citris-uc.org/">CITRIS and the Banatao Institute</a>, to coordinate UCSC's application to the network.</p>
<p>"UCSC has a lot of initiatives that fit under this broad umbrella of public-interest technology, but they're pretty fragmented," said Benner. Participating in the network, with the enthusiastic support of the chancellor and campus provost/executive vice chancellor, will "break down silos," bring cohesion, and create opportunities for collaboration, he said. The network also provides some funding opportunities, "but it's really more about sharing lessons, experience, curriculum, and research, and participating in an annual conference," he said.</p>
<p>The Institute for Social Transformation, launched in 2018, supports innovative scholarship rooted in social justice and serves as a hub that connects UCSC scholars with partners beyond the university as they seek research-based solutions to pressing problems. The Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the Banatao Institute is a four-campus initiative focused on building tech-based solutions for society&#8217;s most pressing challenges. CITRIS was established in 2001 to shorten the pipeline between university-based laboratory research and the development of cutting-edge applications, platforms, companies, and even industries.</p>
<p>At UCSC, CITRIS is housed in the Baskin School of Engineering. Across the disciplines, however, UCSC is home to numerous initiatives focused on harnessing the power of technology to address social problems, reduce inequality, and promote justice, including the <a href="http://www.everettprogram.org/">Everett Program</a>, the <a href="https://scijust.ucsc.edu/">Science and Justice Research Center</a>, the <a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">Genomics Institute</a>, and the new master's degree program in <a href="https://gpm.soe.ucsc.edu/">Serious Games</a>.</p>
<p>In just one example of tech for social good, UCSC researchers have used gaming technology to develop a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/03/speech-therapy-game.html">speech therapy game</a> for children with cleft palate. The game makes post-surgery follow-up care accessible to children around the world, including those in developing countries and those who lack the financial resources to access this essential therapy.</p>
<p>At UCSC and beyond, people have been trying to use technology in service of social change for decades, said Benner, but a national network of colleges and universities will advance the work exponentially and elevate themes of equity and social justice.</p>
<p>"It's not a new area of interest," he said. "We have efforts within disciplines to think about ethics and the social implications of technological change, but there are very few good, interdisciplinary communities that are trying to bridge technology and social change by training students and doing better research."</p>
<p>"There are a lot of people in technology who want to develop the right app to support various needs," added Benner. "But those efforts need to be integrated into understanding the social dynamics&#8212;the politics, race, gender, and class aspects of using technology in those contexts. We've seen good intentions gone awry, with social media and Facebook being large-scale examples."</p>
<p>Facebook, he noted, was introduced and "framed" as being a tool for good, to build ties and connections. "But today all sorts of people use social media connections to manipulate people for their interests," added Benner. "Without thinking through the social consequences at the early stages, we end up where our democracy is in peril."</p>
<p>"This network is an opportunity to build out the field of public-interest technology," said Benner.</p>
<p>The network supports public-interest technology through curriculum development, faculty research opportunities, and experiential learning programs. The goal is to inspire a new era of technological innovation and a new generation of policy leaders.&#160;</p>
<p>As the network's application states, "Colleges and universities have a fundamental responsibility to educate students to connect their technical education and practice to questions of individual rights, justice, social welfare, and the public good reflected in the university&#8217;s public purpose." The network will connect and support educational institutions so they can define the field of public interest technology within academia and develop a pipeline of students who are eager to pursue careers in the field.</p>
<p>The network provided funding for 27 projects through its "Network Challenge" in 2019; outcomes will be highlighted during its annual meeting in November. New funding proposals will be reviewed through a 2020 Network Challenge.</p>
<p>"We need multidisciplinary teams at universities and colleges to respond to the joint technological and policy needs of the public," Anne-Marie Slaughter, CEO of New America, wrote in a congratulatory email to new members.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="65ddfee580727017465cacce588fa43d"><name>moglen-conference-endowed-lecture</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus conference to inaugurate new ‘Helene Moglen Lecture in Feminism and Humanities’     </title><summary>UC Santa Cruz will present Writing for Living, a conference in honor of emeritus dean of humanities and literature professor Helene Moglen (1936-2018), on March 13-14 at the Humanities Division.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz news, ucsc news, feminist studies, writing for living, ucsc humanities division, ucsc feminist studies</keywords><start-date>1582259100000</start-date><display-name>Moglen conference-endowed lecture</display-name><path>/2020/02/moglen-conference-endowed-lecture</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/02/moglen-conference-endowed-lecture</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1582257012422</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1582259064225</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>American Studies</value><value>Literature</value><value>History of Consciousness</value><value>Feminist Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/02/images/helene-moglen-poster-450-use.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/02/images/helene-moglen-poster-450-use.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>helene-moglen-poster-450-use.jpg</name><display-name>helene-moglen-poster-450-use.jpg</display-name><file-size>77867</file-size><width>450</width><height>291</height></image><image-alt>Helene Moglen ucsc conference poster</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/02/images/moglen-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/02/images/moglen-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>moglen-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>moglen-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>14680</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Helene Moglen</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/02/images/moglen-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/02/images/moglen-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>moglen-300.jpg</name><display-name>moglen-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>146262</file-size><width>300</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt>Helene Moglen</image-alt><image-caption>Helene Moglen</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz will present <strong><em>Writing for Living</em></strong>, a conference in honor of emeritus dean of humanities and literature professor Helene Moglen (1936-2018), on March 13-14 at the Humanities Division.</p>
<p>The conference inaugurates the first biennial <a href="https://culturalstudies.ucsc.edu/helene-moglen/"><strong><em>Helene Moglen Lecture in Feminism and the Humanities</em></strong></a>, which will be delivered by Myra Jehlen, Board of Governors emerita professor of English at Rutgers University, on the topic of &#8220;Unreadable Writing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beginning on Friday evening, with a reading by acclaimed poet and former student Brenda Shaughnessy, the day-and-a-half event invites colleagues and former students to speak about their current work on themes related to--or inspired by--Moglen&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>The conference is designed to be a celebration of Moglen&#8217;s contributions to feminist and psychoanalytic theory in literature, feminist institution building, the mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students, and the teaching of writing, both in and outside of the university.</p>
<p>The Saturday sessions will include one dedicated to thinking about trauma, writing, psychoanalysis and teaching, and another on Asian-American and women-of-color literatures and visual production, feminist theory, and critical race studies.</p>
<p><strong>Additional keynote speakers</strong> at the conference will include Leslie Bow on &#8220;Writing in Absence&#8221;<strong>, </strong>and Susan Derwin about &#8220;Writing with Veterans.&#8221;</p>
<p>A professor of English and Asian American studies at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and Moglen&#8217;s former graduate student, Bow will speak on race fetishism and psychoanalysis. She will draw her talk from her current work on "Racist Love: Asian Americans and the Fantasy of Race."&#160; &#160;</p>
<p>Derwin, director of the Interdisciplinary Humanities Center and professor of German, Slavic, and Semitic Studies at UC Santa Barbara,&#160;will speak about&#160;the essence of Moglen's relationship to writing as a practice that makes living possible.&#160;She is founding director of the University of California Veterans Summer Writing Workshop and of Foundations in the Humanities, a correspondence program for incarcerated individuals operating in multiple California prisons</p>
<p>Shaughnessy will read from her poetry at both the opening and closing of the conference. Now an assistant professor of English at Rutgers University, she was a double major in literature and women&#8217;s studies at UCSC, as well as Moglen&#8217;s undergraduate student in the early 1990s.&#160;A finalist for the prestigious international Griffin Poetry Prize and recipient of a Guggenheim award, her latest book is&#160;<em>The Octopus Museum</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Moglen first came to UCSC in 1978</strong> as a professor of literature and dean of the humanities--she was the first woman dean in the University of California system. She also served as provost of Kresge College until 1983, transforming and revitalizing that college into a vibrant intellectual community.</p>
<p>Moglen helped to shape the modern UCSC campus by establishing an independent School of Arts, integrating writing into the foundation curriculum, and establishing and chairing the Committee on Sexual Harassment. She served as chair of the Women's Studies program from 1984-1989, in addition to founding the Focused Research Activity (FRA) in Women&#8217;s/Feminist Studies.</p>
<p>Appointed to the prestigious Presidential Chair in Literature in 2003, she used that funding to establish the Institute of Advanced Feminist Research and support its program of research. A cross-disciplinary, collaborative bridge between the university and the wider community, it sponsored reading groups, conferences, publication projects, and graduate student research.</p>
<p>Moglen retired in 2008, but remained engaged by still teaching until 2013 and mentoring graduate students and junior faculty.</p>

support research on planets beyond our solar system</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz astronomers have received three major grants from the Heising-Simons Foundation for projects related to direct imaging of planets around other stars.</p>
<p>In recent decades, astronomers have discovered thousands of planets outside our solar system, called exoplanets. The vast majority of these have been detected indirectly using methods that rely on precise measurements of the light from their host stars.</p>
<p>Direct imaging of exoplanets is much more difficult because the faint light from a planet tends to be hidden in the glare of the bright star around which it orbits. But it is potentially a powerful approach for studying exoplanets because it enables the use of spectroscopy to analyze the light from a planet for clues to its chemical composition and other properties.</p>
<p>Direct imaging and spectroscopy of exoplanets has the potential to characterize Earth-like planets around other stars and possibly even detect signs of life on them.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the next generation of ground-based telescopes, we could potentially image a rocky planet in the habitable zone of a nearby M-dwarf star, but current technology is not there yet,&#8221; said Rebecca Jensen-Clem, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptive Optics</strong></p>
<p>Jensen-Clem is part of a multi-university team of astronomers that has been funded by the Heising-Simons Foundation to advance the technologies for a new era of exoplanet direct imaging and spectroscopy. Her part of the project, funded by a $995,000 grant to UC Santa Cruz, will involve work at UCSC&#8217;s Laboratory for Adaptive Optics and at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Adaptive optics (AO) is a critical technology for direct imaging of exoplanets, and UC Santa Cruz has played a leading role in its development. AO systems sharpen the images obtained by ground-based telescopes by removing the blurring effects of turbulence in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. AO systems can also be used to control image distortions introduced by the telescope itself, such as slight misalignments of mirror segments in large telescopes like those at Keck Observatory that use segmented primary mirrors.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we&#8217;re trying to image exoplanets, we need to correct every possible source of distortions,&#8221; Jensen-Clem explained. &#8220;This initiative is a series of related projects to advance adaptive optics technology, not only to improve the performance of current telescopes, but also because we will need this technology for the next generation of giant, 30-meter class telescopes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another project in this initiative is being led by Steph Sallum, currently a postdoctoral fellow at UC Santa Cruz, who will be joining the astronomy faculty at UC Irvine in July.</p>
<p><strong>SCALES</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Andrew Skemer, associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics, is developing a new instrument for the Keck Telescopes that will be dedicated to exoplanet spectroscopy. A $1 million grant from the Heising-Simons Foundation is funding Skemer&#8217;s team to complete the design stage and purchase or fabricate several critical components for the instrument, called the Santa Cruz Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy (SCALES).</p>
<p>SCALES is designed to maximize the ability of astronomers to detect and characterize directly-imaged exoplanets in the thermal infrared wavelengths where they peak in brightness. Skemer explained that directly imaged planets are far enough away from their host stars that they slowly cool off over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The exoplanets we aim to detect and characterize with direct imaging tend to be relatively cold and emit the majority of their light in the thermal infrared,&#8221; he said. &#8220;By operating at longer wavelengths than existing spectrographs of this kind, SCALES will extend the wavelength range we use to characterize exoplanets, and will also discover new exoplanets that are not detectable with near-infrared instruments.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>PEAS</strong></p>
<p>The third project, funded by a $400,000 Heising-Simons grant, is led by Emily Martin, a postdoctoral fellow working with Skemer, and it will be based at UC&#8217;s Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton. Both Martin and Sallum are UCSC Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellows as well as National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellows. Martin&#8217;s goal is to perform spectroscopic observations of solar system planets as if they were distant exoplanets, producing an atlas for use in interpreting exoplanet observations and designing future exoplanet instruments.</p>
<p>Because they are so far away, directly imaged exoplanets appear as point sources of light. Martin is developing a novel instrument, called the Planet as Exoplanet Analog Spectrograph (PEAS), which will take the light from a planet such as Jupiter and effectively turn it into a point source for spectroscopic analysis.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can then compare the results of our analyses with what we already know about the planets in our solar system from space missions that have actually sent probes to those planets and done direct measurements,&#8221; Martin explained.</p>
<p>As Skemer put it, &#8220;PEAS will tell us if we&#8217;re doing it right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although these projects are very different from one another, they will all provide critical new knowledge and capabilities needed to discover and understand the full diversity of planets to be found beyond our solar system.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6a51252c80727017465cacce495fc288"><name>election-primary-2020</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>2020 Primary Election</title><start-date>1582876800000</start-date><display-name>2020 Primary Election</display-name><path>/2020/02/election-primary-2020</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/02/election-primary-2020</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1582331667723</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1582647424127</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday, March 3rd is the Primary Elections in California.

<p>We heard concerns that making the $2,500 housing supplement &#8220;needs-based&#8221; would disqualify many from eligibility, particularly international students. To address this concern, we will remove the &#8220;needs-based&#8221; condition, to allow full-time, in-residence doctoral students within their first five years, and Master of Fine Arts students in their first two years, to receive the supplement. We also heard concerns that the cost of the housing supplement would be borne by departments. That is not the case. The housing supplement will be centrally funded. In addition, we commit to regular reviews of program funding levels.</p>
<p>We also heard many concerns from students and faculty about the letters of warning remaining in our graduate students&#8217; employment files as they move forward. They are concerned that the letter may impact future employment on campus and in their post-graduation careers. To address this concern, we are committed to the following:</p>
<p>For students who immediately resume all of their TA/GSI appointment obligations, including teaching and holding regularly scheduled sections and office hours, and for whom we have verified submission of fall, winter and spring grades, we will rescind their letter of warning at the end of this academic year.</p>
<p>Additionally doctoral and MFA students who resume their TA/GSI appointment obligations will receive the $2,500 housing supplement retroactive to Sept. 1, 2019, for the 2019-20 academic year. Doctoral and MFA students supported through GSR/Fellowship appointments will be included in the retroactive receipt of the housing supplement available at the end of the academic year.</p>
<p>I want to take this opportunity to clarify that fall-grade submission, including the removal of the temporary P grade, will be verified on Thursday, Feb. 27. This provides instructors of record and course-sponsoring units the time needed to submit final course grades once they have full grading information from fall TAs.</p>
<p>I am grateful for the honest conversations I have had with members of our community over the past weeks. My hope is that this message provides clarification and assurance of next steps. The opportunities described here are intended to help bring our campus community back to its teaching, learning, and research mission.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Graduate Students and Faculty</audience><admin>Interim Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7904ef1c80727017465cacce0bb3c14e"><name>thomas-schleich-in-memoriam</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Thomas Schleich (1938–2020)</title><start-date>1582531200000</start-date><display-name>In Memoriam: Thomas Schleich (1938–2020)</display-name><path>/2020/02/thomas-schleich-in-memoriam</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/02/thomas-schleich-in-memoriam</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1582578331390</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1582578512745</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/02/images/tom-schleich-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/02/images/tom-schleich-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tom-schleich-300.jpg</name><display-name>tom-schleich-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>67967</file-size><width>300</width><height>450</height></image><image-alt>Tom Schleich</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/02/images/tom-schleich-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/02/images/tom-schleich-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tom-schleich-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>tom-schleich-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19110</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Tom Schleich</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Thomas Schleich</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>It is with deep sadness that we report the passing of our wonderful colleague Professor Thomas Schleich. Born in 1938 and originally from Staten Island, New York, Tom received his bachelor's degree from Cornell University and his Ph.D. from Rockefeller University. After graduate school, he moved to Dartmouth University and then the University of Oregon, where he pursued postdoctoral research in the laboratory of Professor Peter von Hippel, specializing in biophysical chemistry.</p>
<p>Tom joined the UCSC faculty in 1969 and initiated a groundbreaking research program focused on the application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) approaches for studying protein structure and dynamics. As his research matured, Tom narrowed his attention to the unique proteins of the eye lens, which are remarkably dense in concentration yet avoid crystallization or aggregation. Tom pioneered a technique known as off-resonance rotating-frame relaxation measurements for determining how eye lens proteins move and tumble in their natural environment. In turn, these elegant approaches provided deep molecular insights into vision processes and how such processes fail in conditions such as cataracts. As a testament to the importance of his research, Tom maintained years of steady funding from the National Institutes of Health. Moreover, in collaboration with Professor Phillip Crews, Tom raised federal and private funds to establish the first instruments in what is now a thriving UCSC NMR Facility.</p>
<p>Beyond his research, Tom was a generous and selfless mentor to his graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and young chemistry colleagues. As a research advisor, Tom guided a number of outstanding young scientists to their graduate degrees. Several of these students have gone on to highly successful academic careers. As a chemistry colleague, Tom served three separate terms as department chair, guiding the department&#8217;s growth and the hiring of outstanding young faculty. While in this leadership role, Tom&#8217;s door was always open to any of us seeking advice on negotiating the twists and turns of academic life.</p>
<p>We remember Tom as an incredibly warm, outgoing colleague with an infectious, booming laugh that echoed through the chemistry halls. He exuded a love of science and academics, which set the stage for the collegial, forward-thinking environment that characterizes the current Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. Tom was a true leader. Even after he retired, Tom routinely came back to the department to catch up with current research, meet new faculty, and look over new instrumentation&#8212;especially NMR spectrometers! Tom was also an accomplished photographer and printmaker, with works featured in annual and juried shows around the Santa Cruz community. Those of us who knew Tom feel incredibly fortunate to have had him in our lives.</p>
<p>Tom is survived by his wife, Annelies de Kater, and stepdaughter Rachel Truesdell.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Ilan Benjamin and Glenn Millhauser, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7917688c80727017465cacce8c95095b"><name>cpevc-search-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>CP/EVC recruitment update</title><start-date>1582531200000</start-date><display-name>CP/EVC recruitment update</display-name><path>/2020/02/cpevc-search-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/02/cpevc-search-update</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1582579542000</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1582579542000</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">Although, we originally planned for CP/EVC finalists to visit campus during winter quarter, the visits have been postponed until spring quarter.

astronomers in North America, has established a new accolade, Fellow of the AAS, to honor members for extraordinary achievement and service.</p>
<p>The AAS Board of Trustees has designated <a href="https://aas.org/grants-and-prizes/aas-fellows">an initial group of more than 200 Legacy Fellows</a>, including five faculty members in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. They are Professor <strong>Natalie Batalha</strong>, Professor Emerita <strong>Sandra Faber</strong>, Professor Emeritus <strong>Douglas Lin</strong>, Professor and Director of UC Observatories <strong>Claire Max</strong>, and Professor Emeritus <strong>Stan Woosley</strong>.</p>
<p>Also among this first class of honorees, E. Margaret Burbidge&#8212;the first woman to serve as AAS President (1976-1978)&#8212;was singled out as Inaugural Fellow.</p>
<p>AAS Fellows will be recognized for original research and publication, innovative contributions to astronomical techniques or instrumentation, significant contributions to education and public outreach, and noteworthy service to astronomy and to the society itself. Many other scientific societies acknowledge their members&#8217; scientific accomplishments and service to the field by electing them as fellows, something the AAS hasn&#8217;t done before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our members were missing out on the opportunity to not only celebrate the accomplishments of individual astronomers, but also the success of the field more generally,&#8221; said current AAS President Megan Donahue.</p>
<p>Beginning this year, there will be an annual call for nominations of new AAS Fellows. &#8220;I know that future AAS Presidents will take great pleasure in announcing the new class of Fellows during the prize ceremony that is a highlight of every winter AAS meeting,&#8221; Donahue said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7e751a8980727017465cacce4c2f9526"><name>chancellor-venues</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Chancellor announces workgroup, advisory committee to support graduate students</title><summary>Chancellor Cynthia Larive announced a new Senate-Administrative Graduate Education working group to develop a comprehensive, actionable plan for strengthening graduate education and a Chancellor’s Advisory Committee on Graduate Education.&#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In <a href="chancellor-senate-remarks.xml">remarks delivered</a> to the UC Santa Cruz Academic Senate on Feb. 19, Larive announced a new Senate-Administrative Graduate Education working group to develop a comprehensive, actionable plan for strengthening graduate education at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Larive shared that she was creating the <a href="images/chancellor-memo-joint-working-group.pdf">Chancellor&#8217;s Advisory Committee on Graduate Education</a>, a standing group of graduate students and faculty representatives tasked with examining and making recommendations related to graduate-student support</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Together, these two groups will help to guide our campus as we chart a new course,&#8221; Larive said during the meeting.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The working group&#8217;s core charge will be to develop a strategic plan for appropriate and sustainable support of graduate programs on campus. This group will assess the revenue sources currently used for graduate program support and evaluate the carrying capacity of programs based on experience and prospects for external funding, faculty size, professional, and career development. Appropriate levels of support for graduate students, particularly housing support and summer, will be an important consideration for the sustainable growth of graduate programs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new advisory committee will focus on examining and making recommendations to improve graduate student support throughout graduate school and beyond as graduate students prepare for a range of careers beyond the professoriate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The working group and standing committee <a href="https://campus-climate.ucsc.edu/graduate-student-compensation/">follow additional initiatives</a> to provide graduate students with greater support. Larive announced in January new, guaranteed funding packages for Ph.D. and MFA students, as well as a new housing supplement until more affordable campus housing becomes available.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To provide immediate financial support to Ph.D. and MFA students, Interim Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/02/cpevc-clarification-grad-programs.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced on Monday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the new $2,500 housing supplement would be available in the current academic year for graduate students who resume their TA/GSI appointment obligations for fall, winter, and spring. The campus also removed the needs-based requirement.</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Julie Guthman has been awarded the 2019 American Association of Geographers Meridian Book Award for Outstanding Scholarly Work in Geography for her book, <em>Wilted: Pathogens, Chemicals, and the Fragile Future of the Strawberry Industry</em>.</p>
<p>In <em>Wilted</em>, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/08/guthman-wilted.html">Guthman paints an uncertain picture</a> of the future of the California strawberry industry, which is built on access to land, cheap labor, pesticides, and agreeable climate conditions&#8212;all of which are in jeopardy today, says Guthman, a professor of social sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://news.aag.org/2020/02/aag-2019-book-awards-announced/">announcing the award</a>, the association likened Guthman's book to "a <em>Silent Spring </em>for our present moment," referring to Rachel Carson's pathbreaking book about pesticides, and called Guthman's analysis "about so much more than strawberries; it is about the sociological consequences of corporate domination of scientific practice and the limits of chemical plantation agriculture."</p>
<p>Guthman's deeply researched book, the citation says, examines the "co-evolution" of strawberry monocultures, soils, chemicals, climate, and labor, and concludes that the result is "ever more hostile growing conditions" that require "ever more extreme measures to perpetuate a deeply destructive agricultural practice on which ever more extensive food markets depend."</p>
<p>The association concludes by saying the book stands as "an empirically grounded clarion call to fundamentally reorganize how we produce food, conduct research, and organize land and labor markets."</p>

<p>The UCSC team, working with doctors and scientists at UC Davis and Tufts University, will use a combination of approaches involving bioelectronic devices, machine learning, and regenerative medicine in an effort to achieve precise control over the physiological processes involved in wound healing.</p>
<p>Hard-to-heal wounds, such as blast wounds from explosions, are a major problem for soldiers and veterans, and chronic wounds such as diabetic ulcers afflict large numbers of patients. In the United States, Medicare costs for wounds amount to over $28 billion annually, according to a <a href="https://www.valueinhealthjournal.com/article/S1098-3015(17)30329-7/fulltext">recent study</a>.</p>
<p>Principal investigator Marco Rolandi, associate professor and chair of electrical and computer engineering in UCSC's <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a>, said the new project will bring together his lab's previous work in bioelectronics (the integration of electronic devices and materials with biological systems) and his collaborators' expertise in regenerative medicine and wound healing. Their goal is to cut wound healing time in half with an intelligent system that both stimulates and monitors the wound.</p>
<p><strong>Bioelectronic bandage</strong></p>
<p>The idea is to use a flexible bioelectronic bandage to deliver ions to control the electrochemical environment of the wound, as well as small molecules and growth factors to promote healing, while at the same time monitoring the physiological processes in the wound using optical sensors. An artificial intelligence (AI) system will take input from the sensors, assess the state of the wound, and deliver appropriate stimuli to speed the healing process. The device will also give doctors a user-friendly interface for remote sensing of the wound status and a menu of therapeutic options.</p>
<p>"What's unique about this project is we want to close the loop between sensing and stimulating, so that there is feedback between the wound and the intelligent bandage," Rolandi said.</p>
<p>Marcella Gomez, an assistant professor of applied mathematics with expertise in feedback systems and synthetic biology, will play a key role in the project, developing a data-driven wound healing model and algorithms for closed-loop feedback control.</p>
<p>Other members of the UCSC team include Mircea Teodorescu, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering with expertise in bioengineering and robotics, and Alexander Sher, associate professor of physics, who studies neural networks in the retina using microelectrode arrays.</p>
<p><strong>Interdisciplinary collaboration</strong></p>
<p>"This collaboration, which brings together the work of engineers, scientists, and medical doctors to solve an important problem, is a wonderful example of the creativity that comes of interdisciplinary research," said Baskin School of Engineering dean Alexander Wolf.</p>
<p>The collaboration developed when Michael Levin, a professor of biology and director of the <a href="https://allencenter.tufts.edu/">Allen Discovery Center at Tufts University</a>, contacted Rolandi after reading a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/advs.201600527">review article</a> Rolandi had written in <em>Advanced Science</em>. Levin has expertise in both artificial intelligence and developmental biology, and his lab has done pioneering work on how cells in the body form bioelectric networks that guide developmental and regenerative processes.</p>
<p>Bringing clinical expertise to the project are collaborators at UC Davis led by Dr. Min Zhao and Dr. Roslyn Rivka Isseroff. Dr. Isseroff, a professor of dermatology at UC Davis with research interests around tissue repair and regeneration, has decades of experience treating wounds and directs a wound healing clinic for the VA Northern California Health Care System. Dr. Zhao also studies wound healing and has done important work on the role of neural signaling in regeneration and the use of bioelectric controls to stimulate nerve growth.</p>
<p>"It's an interdisciplinary team with expertise ranging from bioelectronic devices and machine learning to clinical medicine," Rolandi said. "Wound healing problems affect many people, from veterans and firefighters to people with chronic diabetic ulcers, so it's important to develop a new strategy to improve the treatment of hard-to-heal wounds."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8d48e6a580727017465cacce9de16e91"><name>vote-in-tuesdays-election</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Vote in Tuesday’s election</title><summary>Tuesday, March 3, is the Presidential Primary Election in California.</summary><start-date>1582876800000</start-date><display-name>Vote in Tuesday’s election</display-name><path>/2020/02/vote-in-tuesdays-election</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/02/vote-in-tuesdays-election</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1582918329967</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1582918589507</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>Tuesday, March 3, is the Presidential Primary Election in California.

Unfortunately, despite our best efforts to find an amenable resolution, 54 teaching assistants have continued to withhold fall grade information. As a result, we have been left with no choice but to take an action that we had truly and deeply hoped to avoid. As I previously shared, students who fail to meet their contractual obligations by withholding fall grade information will not receive spring quarter appointments, or if they have received them they will be dismissed from their spring quarter appointments.<br/>&#160;<br/>We care deeply about our graduate students, value their contributions to our campus through both their scholarship and research, and their work as teaching assistants and graduate student instructors. It is extremely disappointing to us that we have to take such a drastic step, but we ultimately cannot retain graduate students as teaching assistants who will not fulfill their responsibilities. While we have been able to successfully get 96 percent of grades submitted for the fall quarter, we cannot again jeopardize our undergraduates&#8217; education or put them in a position where they may not have the teaching resources they need to succeed throughout the spring quarter.<br/>&#160;<br/>I want to thank all of you who have had honest and difficult conversations with graduate students about the need to end this unsanctioned strike. Our graduate students are brilliant scholars and, like you, I want to see them succeed at UC Santa Cruz and beyond. No doubt your conversations encouraged some graduate students to return to their important work. <br/>&#160;<br/>Alongside other campus leaders, I met five times with graduate student leadership with the hope that we could resolve this unsanctioned strike and return to our shared mission of educating undergraduates and conducting research for the good of our society. <br/>&#160;<br/>While I&#8217;ve disagreed with the tactics the graduate students have used to communicate their concerns, I do not want to downplay the gravity of those concerns. The students have highlighted a real need for greater support because of the high cost of housing in Santa Cruz and limited campus housing available to them. As a reminder, in an effort to provide more financial support and predictability for our Ph.D. and MFA students and work toward greater support overall, the campus is:<br/>
<ul>
<li><strong>providing an annual $2,500 housing supplement until more campus housing becomes available for graduate students.</strong> This support will be available retroactively for this academic year for doctoral and MFA students who resume their TA/GSI appointment obligations for fall, winter, and spring quarters.</li>
<li><strong>offering new and continuing doctoral students support packages for five years (two years for MFA students).</strong> These packages will have a minimum level of support equivalent to that of a 50 percent teaching assistantship.</li>
<li><strong>creating two temporary housing assistance programs to support graduate students through Slug Support.</strong></li>
<li><strong>forming a joint Senate-Administrative Graduate Education Working Group</strong> to develop a strategic plan for appropriate and sustainable graduate program support.</li>
<li><strong>convening a new Chancellor&#8217;s Advisory Committee on Graduate Education</strong> to examine and make recommendations to improve graduate student support throughout graduate school and beyond as graduate students prepare for a range of careers beyond the professoriate.&#160;</li>
</ul>
With a clear sense for how many graduate students will continue serving as teaching assistants in the spring, we can now begin planning for how we deliver an education to our undergraduates. As I shared at the Feb. 19 Academic Senate meeting, this is a problem for us to solve. I am committed to working closely with all impacted departments and providing additional resources so that we can continue with our mission. I will soon be visiting impacted departments to join in discussions about our curriculum.<br/>&#160;<br/>This has been a difficult time for our campus and we have more problems to solve. <br/>&#160;<br/>We all believe deeply in the mission of UC Santa Cruz and public higher education. We have the privilege to teach a diverse student body and provide them with knowledge and skills that can transform their lives. We have the honor to cultivate scholars who will be the next generation of professors and practitioners. And we, as professors, help reshape our world, whether it&#8217;s through ideas, inventions, and discovery. <br/>&#160;<br/>I look forward to continuing to fulfill our tremendous mission.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8e4fc0c880727017465cacce4121dcf0"><name>policy-on-names</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCOP seeks comments on proposed 'Presidential Policy on Gender Recognition and Lived Name'</title><start-date>1582272000000</start-date><display-name>Policy on names</display-name><path>/2020/02/policy-on-names</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/02/policy-on-names</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1582935556204</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1583276603078</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of California Office of the President invites comments on the proposed Presidential Policy on Gender Recognition and Lived Name.&#160; The policy addresses the following key issues:</span></p>

We are also monitoring the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and relevant authorities closely. Clearly, the situation is changing daily, and we are prepared to take all proper precautions to protect our community and make sure everyone feels safe.</p>
<p>To date, there are no reported coronavirus cases at UC Santa Cruz or in Santa Cruz County. Three people <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/message-campus-community-covid-19">at the UC Davis campus</a> are currently in isolation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is testing one for COVID&#8211;19, while the other two are asymptomatic and, following CDC guidance, have not been tested.</p>
<p>For now, the most important thing is for you to do is stay home and seek medical care if you&#8217;re feeling sick, especially if you develop a cough or a high temperature. Students should call the Student Health Center at 831&#8211;459&#8211;2591 for instructions on self-care or to make an appointment.</p>
<h3>How UCSC is preparing</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Student Health Center:</strong> The <a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/">Student Health Center</a> has partnered with the Santa Cruz County Health Department to receive information on any incoming travelers who have been advised to self-quarantine. The campus Office of Emergency Services has prepared a quarantine protocol for residential students who may require self-quarantine.</li>
<li><strong>Containment:</strong> Students with respiratory symptoms and fever will be triaged in a separate area at Student Health Services. Any testing for COVID&#8211;19 will be coordinated with local public health officials.</li>
<li><strong>Supplies:</strong> Cold and flu prevention packets that include tissues and hand sanitizer are being distributed at the Student Health Center and across campus.</li>
<li><strong>Outreach and preparedness:</strong> The Student Health Center and the Office of Emergency Services are preparing outreach materials and sessions for personal and business continuity preparedness. Town halls and presentation dates will be released in the coming week.</li>
<li><strong>Quarantine space:</strong> For residential students unable to go home who have been advised by public health to self-quarantine for 14 days, the university has established quarters. Individuals under self-quarantine will be provided with a private bedroom, phone-in wellness checks from medical professionals, and meal deliveries.</li>
<li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Campus is preparing to distribute additional hand-sanitizing stations at numerous buildings. Faculty, staff, and students are reminded to practice regular hand-washing, to cover one&#8217;s cough or sneeze with a tissue, and to regularly clean frequently touched surfaces. Those with respiratory symptoms should stay home to avoid infecting others.</li>
<li><strong>Academic support:</strong> Campus is exploring options for delivering education via alternative platforms to allow anyone who is ill or in self-quarantine to compete coursework remotely.</li>
<li><strong>Education abroad programs:</strong> To ensure the safety of our students and faculty, the university is closely monitoring all U.S. State Department and Centers for Disease Control travel advisories. Programs may be postponed, cancelled, or delivered in alternative formats.</li>
<li><strong>Help stop the spread:</strong> Share the facts about COVID&#8211;19 prevention and symptoms. Faculty and staff, please print and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communication/factsheets.html">post CDC bulletins</a> in your academic and administrative buildings.</li>
</ul>
<h3>International travel restrictions</h3>
<p>This week, the Centers for Disease Control has added a Level 3 Travel Notice for <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-south-korea">South Korea</a>, <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-italy">Italy</a>, and <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-italy">Iran</a> to the existing Level 3 Travel Notice for China. For the health and well-being of the UC community, President Janet Napolitano has expanded the <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/coronavirus/letter-president-travel-advisory.pdf">UC Travel Directive</a> to temporarily avoid all non-essential, university-related travel to countries that are designated with a CDC Warning &#8211; Level 3 Travel Notice. For the latest on travel warnings and UC-related updates, visit <a href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2020/01/ucs-response-to-coronavirus.html">ucal.us/coronavirus</a>.</p>
<p>UCSC is following CDC guidelines for decisions about travel and programming abroad.</p>
<ul>
<li>UCSC considers any country with a CDC Level 3 Travel Health Advisory, &#8220;Avoid Nonessential Travel,&#8221; an elevated-risk destination. University-related student travel to those countries will be prohibited, and staff and faculty must <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/coronavirus/uc-travel-guidance.html">request campus approval</a> prior to travel.</li>
<li>For any country with a CDC Level 2 Travel Health Advisory, &#8220;Practice Enhanced Precautions,&#8221; UCSC will alert students in the country and advocate for adoption of enhanced infection-control precautions. University-run programs will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine an appropriate course of action.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Spring break</h3>
<p>COVID&#8211;19 is present in a number of countries. Students, faculty, and staff making spring break travel plans should visit the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html">US State Department Travel Advisories</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html">CDC &#8220;Coronavirus 2019 Information for Travel&#8221;</a> websites for up-to-date travel advisories.</p>
<h3>Planning for summer travel abroad</h3>
<p>Although we do not know whether the Level 3 Travel Health Advisories for China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran will remain in place over the summer, we strongly suggest UCSC students, faculty, or staff planning to participate in or lead organized programs of study, work or research in those countries this summer make alternate plans. We are examining contingency plans for students who might be required to stay on campus this summer including meaningful programming opportunities and housing.</p>
<h3>Updates on COVID&#8211;19</h3>
<p>As of Feb. 28, there are a total of <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx">34 positive cases in California:</a> 24 are from repatriation flights. The other 10 confirmed cases include seven that are travel-related, one due to person-to-person exposure from a very close contact (a spouse) and two from unknown sources. These numbers align with the CDC. Approximately 200 people have been tested to date.</p>
<p>The health risk from novel coronavirus to the general public remains low at this time, <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-006.aspx">according to state health officials</a>. While COVID&#8211;19 has a high transmission rate, it has a low mortality rate. From the international data the state has, of those who have tested positive for COVID&#8211;19, approximately 80 percent do not exhibit symptoms that would require hospitalization. There have been no confirmed deaths related to COVID&#8211;19 in the United States. The state is assessing the situation as it evolves.</p>
<h3>Academic impact and support</h3>
<p>While health and safety are our primary concerns, we remain mindful of the academic challenges students face as more travel destinations and study-abroad programs are affected by the spread of the virus. Academic units are encouraged to make their best efforts to support students whose quarters may be disrupted due to coronavirus concerns so that they can complete their coursework.</p>
<p>We also are aware that staff, post-doctoral fellows and faculty may find their work disrupted due to travel restrictions, and we urge supervisors to be flexible and generous in establishing alternative responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Prevention and protection</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners also are effective.</li>
<li>Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throw the tissue away.</li>
<li>Put used tissues in the trash immediately.</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with sick people.</li>
<li>If you get sick with a fever and respiratory symptoms, stay home from work or school and limit contact with others.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
<li>Maintain your immune system by getting plenty of rest, sleep and a nutritious balanced diet.</li>
