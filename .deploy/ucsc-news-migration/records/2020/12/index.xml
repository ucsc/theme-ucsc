The AXA Research Fund provides the award of &#8364;1 million ($1.19 million) over five years to support Beck&#8217;s efforts to advance the conservation and restoration of coastal habitats as natural defenses against storms and climate change.</p>
<p>Climate change and development are degrading coastal ecosystems and increasing the exposure of communities to risks from flooding, erosion, and sea level rise. According to Beck, however, investments in coastal defenses have focused on construction of seawalls, breakwaters, and other artificial structures, while neglecting the value of reefs and wetlands as powerful natural tools for reducing coastal hazards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coastal habitats such as coral reefs, marshes, and mangrove forests can serve as a critical first line of defense,&#8221; Beck said. &#8220;Despite the valuable coastal protection benefits these ecosystems provide, they have been undervalued and lost at a rapid global rate. They are now some of the most threatened marine ecosystems on Earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>For two decades, Beck has been leading groundbreaking research to rigorously quantify the social and economic benefits of reefs and wetlands. These efforts and the global partnerships he has built have influenced government agencies, the insurance industry, and development banks to begin considering how their funds could be invested in habitat conservation and restoration to reduce future risk and build resilience.</p>
<p>&#8220;The AXA Chair in Coastal Resilience will allow me and my team to expand our research to identify the most cost-effective opportunities to invest in ecosystems for coastal protection and to provide valuable insights for influential organizations, from the insurance industry to the World Bank,&#8221; Beck said.</p>
<p>The AXA Chairs are the premium funding scheme of the AXA Research Fund, and Beck is the first to hold such a chair at a U.S. university. &#8220;The new AXA Chair in Coastal Resilience will help mitigate the losses from major climate-related hazards and open the way to innovative approaches to better link insurance and the longer term conservation of ecosystems,&#8221; said Marie Bogataj, head of the AXA Research Fund and Foresight.</p>
<p><strong>Natural capital</strong></p>
<p>With over $300 billion paid out by the insurance industry for coastal storm damage in the last ten years, protecting and regenerating existing natural capital is one of the critical components of disaster risk management and climate adaptation in countries that often lack the financial resources to fund relief, recovery, and post-disaster reconstruction efforts.</p>
<p>Chip Cunliffe, AXA XL&#8217;s director of sustainable development, said, &#8220;For over a decade we have been focused on building resilience and understanding ocean risk. Mike Beck&#8217;s leadership and knowledge is second to none, and his expertise will help us integrate these protective ecosystems into our coastal risk index and aid the development of potential new risk transfer mechanisms.&#8221;</p>
<p>An ecologist by training, Beck noted that it is not common for scientists in his field to work with the insurance industry. &#8220;I&#8217;m one of the few, but we really can do so much interesting work together,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He first began working with the insurance industry after a policy colleague and negotiator at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change suggested that the insurance sector would be interested in his research on coastal protection.</p>
<p>&#8220;A real turning point was when we went to the insurance risk modelers and said we want to understand your models and how to put habitat into them,&#8221; Beck said. &#8220;Instead of telling them to look at our new ecological model, we wanted to learn to use their models to speed up the acceptance of natural defenses by the industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beck&#8217;s research as a marine ecologist led him to work increasingly at the interface between marine science, policy, and management action. He spent 20 years with the Nature Conservancy, helping to establish a global marine program and serving as lead marine scientist. He has held various affiliations with UC Santa Cruz over the years and now leads the <a href="https://www.coastalresiliencelab.org/">Coastal Resilience Lab</a> at UCSC.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike Beck&#8217;s work fuses a deep knowledge of natural systems and an understanding of policy and economics to offer tangible, sustainable solutions to the challenges facing coastal ecosystems and the communities that depend on them. It&#8217;s emblematic of the work we aim to do at UC Santa Cruz and the type of training we seek to offer our students,&#8221; said Anne Kapuscinski, director of the <a href="https://csp.ucsc.edu/">Coastal Science and Policy Program</a> and professor of environmental studies.</p>
<p><strong>Global collaborations</strong></p>
<p>In the past few years, Beck has led three global collaborations, producing several major reports and scientific publications that make a strong case for the role of natural habitats in providing coastal protection. This work has shown that the flood reduction benefits provided by coral reefs, mangroves, and marshes can be rigorously quantified and valued, that restoration of these habitats can provide cost-effective defenses, and that insurance products can be aligned with ecosystem-based strategies.</p>
<p>For the World Bank, Beck led a team of economists, ecologists, and engineers to develop approaches for valuing the coastal protection benefits of reefs and mangroves. He also led a two-year working group on coastal defenses that quantified the annual benefits provided by coral reefs and mangroves at local, national, and global scales. With support from Lloyd&#8217;s of London, he led a work group to assess how nature could be incorporated in industry risk models.</p>
<p>Building on this work with funding from the AXA Chair, Beck aims to bring about meaningful changes in the approaches to hazard mitigation worldwide. He wants to see hurricane disaster recovery funds support reef and wetland restoration, using new data on the cost-effectiveness of natural defenses. In working with the insurance industry, he aims to get nature better included in industry risk models and incorporated into innovative new products such as reef and resilience insurance to reduce risk with natural defenses. Beck also hopes to see the natural defense values of habitats included in national economic indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>&#8220;The good news is that reefs and wetlands can recover, and even adapt, if we identify the resources to manage and restore them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Large-scale funding could be available for these coastal habitats if we can measure and communicate their benefits and cost-effectiveness for coastal protection.&#8221;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Equity and Equal Protection</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This year the university realigned existing campus compliance organizations into a single campus Equity and Equal Protection Office.The Office of Equity and Equal Protection comprises the Title IX Office, the Equal Employment Opportunity &amp; Affirmative Action Office, the UCSC ADA Program, and the UCSC Whistleblower Program.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Office of Equity &amp; Equal Protection is responsible for the administration of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s policies and procedures regarding discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, religion, disability, sex, gender, age and other protected identities.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This reorganization of existing compliance resources into a new unit is intended to streamline processes for students, staff and faculty who may have a complaint or grievance, shifting the burden of wayfinding from individuals to the institution. EEP will help complainants identify and enter the appropriate process more quickly, provide support and effective case management, and serve as a resource for the entire campus community on issues of harassment and discrimination.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>California Mandatory Reporting Laws</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As outlined by Penal Code &#167;368 and Welfare and Institutions Code &#167;15600 et al., the California Legislature enacted recent laws to require elderly and dependent adult care custodians, health practitioners, Adult Protective Services staff, law enforcement, and other designated agencies to report and to investigate incidents of abuse/neglect. The categories of abuse and neglect that must be reported by mandated parties now include: physical, sexual, financial, isolation, abandonment, abduction, neglect, mental suffering, and self-neglect.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>California Penal Code &#167;11160 requires prompt, mandatory reporting to the local law enforcement agency by healthcare practitioners (such as those at the Cowell Student Health Center) when they provide medical services to a person they know or reasonably suspect is suffering from wounds inflicted by a firearm or as a result of assaultive or abusive conduct.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Child Abuse Neglect and Reporting Act (CANRA), codified in California Penal Code &#167;&#167;11164-11174.3, requires that employers of mandated reporters (as defined in the Act) promote identification and reporting of child abuse or neglect. It is the policy of the University of California to comply with its obligations under the Act; to require that all university employees and administrators who are mandated reporters make required reports to child protection or law enforcement agencies; and, more broadly, to encourage all members of the university community who observe, have actual knowledge of, or reasonably suspect child abuse or neglect at a university facility or perpetrated by university personnel to promptly report the concern to appropriate law enforcement, external officials and university officials.

Environmental Art and Social Practice (EASP), set to begin in fall quarter of 2021.</span></p>
<p><span>The two-year program is designed for students who want to develop their artwork in relation to social and environmental justice questions, contexts, and communities.</span></p>
<p><span>Working individually and collaboratively, in the studio and in the field, students will have the opportunity to experiment with different approaches in order to build their art practices conceptually and practically, while critically and creatively exploring art&#8217;s role as a catalyst for change.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Environmental Art and Social Practice is a unique transdisciplinary studio art M.F.A. program in that it is thematically focused, offering students the opportunity to channel their concerns and engagements with environmental and social justice into creative art practice,&#8221; noted UCSC art professor and director of graduate studies Laurie Palmer.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Unlike more traditional, open-ended M.F.A. programs, EASP focuses on making and locating art in direct relation with issues and problems, and with diverse communities &#8212;human and non-human&#8212;while remaining grounded in individual and collective commitments, rigorous research, formal pleasures, and aesthetic visions.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;There are several programs in the U.S. that focus on social practice, but not also on its links with environmental art and justice, and there are a few that focus on ecology, but do not highlight social justice,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Abroad, there are several graduate programs that have similar shared concerns but approach them through design-oriented approaches rather than through studio art.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Palmer described how the program came about.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The idea for this program has been gestating for a very long time, growing out of the creative practices of Art Department faculty, with additional inspiration from artists Helen and Newton Harrison, who joined UCSC as emeriti faculty in the early 2000s. But it also arises organically from&#160;UCSC's reputation for and ongoing commitments to social justice and environmental concerns, and it is fed by the growing urgencies of our time surrounding these issues,&#8221; said Palmer.</span></p>
<p><span>The Art Department expects that eight students will make up the first EASP cohort in Fall 2021, with another eight students joining in the Fall of 2022. As EASP students will be encouraged to take interdisciplinary approaches to their work, prospective applicants are encouraged to explore the work of individual faculty members in different departments across the university, as well as in the Art Department.</span></p>
<p><span>Palmer noted that the aim of the program is to attract students with diverse practices, backgrounds, and interests who can learn from each other, as well as with faculty. Whether they come with traditional fine art skills or with experience and skills in other disciplines, the key requirement is that they have an interest in art&#8217;s potential for effecting change, along with ideas for how and why they want to be doing this type of creative work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The awards are presented by Santa Cruz Works, an umbrella organization of mostly tech-related companies with the mission of making Santa Cruz County a great place to start, sustain, and grow businesses. Fifteen organizations and individuals are being honored for their efforts &#8220;to help our community through the onslaught of 2020 challenges: pandemic, wildfires, social injustice, and economic downturn.&#8221; More than 50 nominations were submitted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chancellor is being lauded for leading campus through significant challenges in her first year: COVID-19 and the Santa Cruz Mountains wildfires that destroyed roughly 1,000 homes. &#8220;She has led with calm, care, and integrity &#8212; traits sorely needed in the midst of chaos and unrest,&#8221; event organizers stated when announcing her selection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isabel Bjork and the Genomics Institute are being honored for their contributions to the fight against COVID. The institute, which Bjork serves as executive director, posted the complete genome of the virus on the UCSC Genome Browser, an interactive web-based tool used by researchers worldwide to study genetic data. The institute was also an essential player in uprighting the UCSC Molecular Diagnostic Lab this past spring. The lab has been a valuable campus and community resource, offering COVID testing to students and employees, and to the area&#8217;s most vulnerable residents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy Sanford, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, is being singled out for his role in establishing the lab. In just a few months, he and the other organizers initiated the licensing process, received approval from federal and state agencies, and developed the capacity to test hundreds of samples per day in a lab built from scratch. Its launch was a significant accomplishment in light of the fact UCSC does not have a medical school and had no diagnostic testing in place. While many faculty members and staff members were involved in its creation, Sanford&#8217;s passion for the project stood out, the awards committee stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also on tap to be honored are alumni Susan True, Nada Miljkovic, Jacob Martinez, and Ruby Vasquez.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True and her team at the Santa Cruz Community Foundation responded quickly to both the pandemic and the wildfires. Within days of both the lockdown and later the fires, she was raising funds and disseminating the money to the organizations on the front lines of those battles, ultimately helping hundreds of local residents get back on their feet.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miljkovic is one of the founders of Get Virtual, a nonprofit that gives UCSC students class credits for helping local businesses get websites and e-commerce sites up and running. The organization was founded in the early days of the COVID-19 lockdown, and since then has assisted hundreds of businesses. The program is now being offered at other colleges and universities around the nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martinez is the founder of Watsonville-based Digital NEST, a technology workforce development hub that provides youth in rural communities with high-demand technology skills. After the pandemic lockdowns began this past spring, Martinez secured laptops for Digital NEST members to continue their educations remotely, developed NEST online classes, and still managed to open a new Salinas location. Plans are in the works to open a Gilroy office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martinez is also involved in another project being recognized by Santa Cruz Works. He, wife Joanne Sanchez, and South County educator Ruby Vasquez, also a UCSC graduate, noticed in the early days of the pandemic that farmworkers were being overlooked as an impacted community. The group wanted to create a way to educate the workers and to show the wider community&#8217;s appreciation for them, so the group launched Campesino Caravan. What began as twice-a-week caravans with community members thanking farmworkers with posters and signs morphed into a more expansive effort to provide the laborers with masks, groceries, lunches, and information on the pandemic.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The awards will be presented virtually during a Zoom event the night of Dec. 2.

<p>Williams, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, has spent decades studying the physiology of marine mammals and their extraordinary ability to perform strenuous activities while holding their breath for long periods under water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diving marine mammals experience a lifetime of rapid physiological transitions between normal oxygenation and hypoxia [low oxygen levels],&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got ways to protect themselves and allow their organs to keep functioning while holding their breath for hours at a time, but there&#8217;s a whole suite of biological adaptations that had to happen for them to be able to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lacking those adaptations, humans are vulnerable to rapid damage in a wide range of tissues when oxygen levels drop due to the effects on the lungs and cardiovascular system of infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In a review article <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2020.110849">published December 3 in <em>Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology</em></a>, Williams explores how the diving physiology of marine mammals can help us understand the effects of COVID-19.</p>
<p>&#8220;It really highlights why it is so important for people to protect themselves from infection with this virus,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Damage to oxygen-deprived tissues happens fast and can be irreversible, which may account for the long-term effects we are beginning to see in people after coronavirus infections.&#8221;</p>
<p>The heart and brain are especially sensitive to oxygen deprivation, and marine mammals have multiple mechanisms to protect these and other critical organs. In the first place, marine mammals have much higher oxygen carrying capacity than humans due to their greater blood volume and hemoglobin concentrations. In addition, some marine mammals contract their spleen during dives to release a store of oxygen-rich blood cells into the circulation. To avoid blood clots resulting from such high concentrations of red blood cells, many species lack a key clotting factor found in other mammals.</p>
<p>Other adaptations include greatly increased concentrations of oxygen-carrying proteins such as myoglobin in heart and skeletal muscles and neuroglobin and cytoglobin in the brain. In addition, numerous safety factors and biochemical buffers enable even the most oxygen-dependent tissues in marine mammals to withstand not only low oxygen but also the subsequent reperfusion of tissues with oxygenated blood. In humans, reperfusion after a heart attack or stroke often leads to additional tissue damage.</p>
<p>According to Williams, the solutions that marine mammals have evolved for tolerating hypoxia provide a natural template for understanding the potential for damage to oxygen-deprived tissues in humans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Studying marine mammals allowed me to understand what it takes to protect the body when the availability of oxygen is low,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There are so many ramifications of shutting down the oxygen pathway, and I think that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re seeing in these COVID patients.&#8221;</p>
<p>Williams is particularly concerned about the so-called &#8220;long-haulers&#8221; who continue to have symptoms long after they were infected with the coronavirus.</p>
<p>&#8220;You hear people say it&#8217;s just like the flu, but COVID scares the heck out of me because of the potential for long-term damage to the heart and brain,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When you think about oxygen deprivation and the tissue repair process, it makes sense that many people are having a hard time getting back to normal life, even after a mild infection.&#8221;</p>
<p>Williams urges people to do all they can to avoid becoming infected. &#8220;Our heart and brain cells are meant to last a lifetime, and we cannot replace them once they are damaged,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Dolphins and whales have natural protections that humans lack, so we are highly vulnerable to hypoxia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Randall Davis, a marine biologist at Texas A&amp;M University, coauthored the paper with Williams. This work was funded by the Office of Naval Research.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2007/12/1815.html</url><title>Why diving marine mammals resist brain damage from low oxygen</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2ff22a38807270172c1b96bdec6cc155"><name>new-regional-stay-at-home-order-framework</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New regional stay-at-home order framework released by Gov.

<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The state has been divided into five regions, and when intensive care unit (ICU) capacity in a region drops below 15 percent, a regional stay-at-home order will promptly go into effect for at least three (3) weeks for the counties in that region. Three weeks after the order is implemented, the state will evaluate it weekly for adjustment. The order will be lifted when a region&#8217;s projected ICU capacity meets or exceeds 15%.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Currently, no region has dropped to that level, but the Governor&#8217;s Office projects most regions will do so within days. Counties will have 48 hours to implement the stay-at-home order once issued by the state. Counties can add more restrictive elements to their local order. Santa Cruz county and Santa Clara county (where our Silicon Valley Campus is located) are in the Bay Area region along with Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Monterey, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Solano, and Sonoma.&#160;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><span>The stay-at-home order, once implemented, prohibits private gatherings of any size and also closes sector operations except for critical infrastructure and retail.

<p>The program is meant to smooth out the transition process for faculty. The two main components of the program are a faculty emeriti liaison and PTR agreements.</p>
<p>The inaugural liaison will be Don Brenneis, Emeritus Professor of Anthropology. He will be available for confidential meetings with faculty who are thinking about retirement, in order to discuss options and concerns. He can connect faculty to more specialized resources, and he can provide feedback to faculty considering&#160;PTR agreements.</p>
<p>PTR agreements are binding agreements that may include pre-retirement and post-retirement benefits in exchange for an agreement to retire on a specific date, and these agreements are negotiated with the department chair and the dean. The formal launch of the PTR program will be in&#160;the&#160;winter 2021&#160;quarter, and there will be a website with more information and resources available at that time.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With workouts and team meetings moving to Zoom during the pandemic, things look a little different for UC Santa Cruz Athletics and Recreation this year. But despite the challenge of COVID-19 and the need for physical distancing, it&#8217;s been a year of adaptability, growth, and achievement for the department, coaches, student staff, student-athletes, and the campus fitness and recreation communities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Athletics and Recreation has persevered through the shutdown of in-person operations and the postponement of athletic seasons, while upholding the themes of leadership, community, and merit in all of their programming&#8212;success that's been fueled by passionate students and staff.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Students are a central part of our department,&#8221; said Sue Harriman, director of Athletics and Recreation. &#8220;We often seek feedback from them on important issues before making key decisions because we want to find ways to further enrich the student experience.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mission of Athletics and Recreation stands beyond ensuring students attain physical wellbeing; it&#8217;s a department that enhances the student experience through athletic and recreational activities, along with leadership and community-building opportunities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Varsity student-athletes remain adaptable and resilient</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Athletics and Recreation is composed of multiple program areas: NCAA Division III athletics; FitLife (group and personal fitness); Adventure Rec; intramural sports; sport clubs; boating; Physical Education courses; and a variety of camps, clinics, and workshops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Varsity athletics includes more than 300 student-athletes competing in 15 different sports. With the completion of the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4V4fRAfIrA&amp;t=3s" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">department&#8217;s new brand identity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in June 2020 and UC Santa Cruz athletics celebrating 40 years as members in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the Athletics and Recreation brand exudes the characteristics of pride, inclusivity, and excellence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our athletic teams won five conference championships and four 'coach of the year' awards this past 2019&#8211;2020 academic year,&#8221; said Senior Associate Director of Athletics and Recreation Dino Pollock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With COVID-19 restrictions in place, fall and winter sports teams have been most affected by canceled conference play and championship opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Competition is a huge motivator when it comes to training athletes,&#8221; said UCSC's men's and women&#8217;s head swimming and diving coach Matt Crawford. &#8220;Without that and having no feasible way to train together as a team, it&#8217;s really hard to maintain that level of focus and team cohesiveness.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the men&#8217;s swimming and diving team won their conference championship. This year, they&#8217;re having to resort to individualized, on-land training until they can come together again in the pool. The ultimate hope is &#8220;for both teams to have some semblance of a season this academic year,&#8221; stated Crawford.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women&#8217;s basketball player Mitchell (College Ten &#8216;21, literature, education minor), who is also co-president of the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC), shares the frustration her fellow Slug fall and winter student-athletes are feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As everyone on Mitchell&#8217;s basketball team awaits the news of when they will be able to practice together in a gym once again, they are getting creative on ways they can stay engaged while apart.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of those ways include &#8220;an accountability partner program, where new basketball recruits are teamed up with veteran teammates; holding workouts with each other over Zoom; attending weekly online meetings with our coach; and coming up with fun ways to compete virtually,&#8221; said Mitchell.&#160;</span></p>
<p>Although many of her teammates are not in the area, the few that are local, including Mitchell, have started practicing at outside basketball courts together, while wearing masks and maintaining safe distances apart.</p>
<p><strong>S.L.U.G. leaders</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While athletic teams hold onto hope for what the new year will bring in terms of seasons, Athletics and Recreation realized that strong leadership is of particular importance during this unprecedented time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the switch to online programming this spring, one of the challenges the SAAC&#8212;which addresses interathletic relations, community service, and campus relations&#8212;has been faced with is developing ways in the virtual world for student-athletes to practice their leadership skills.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Athletics and Recreation staff and student-athletes have collaborated to meet that challenge with the initiation of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">S.L.U.G. (Student-athletes Leading Up to Greatness) Leadership Academy,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">10-session, experiential learning program kicking off this winter quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The curriculum, which builds on UCSC&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles-community.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Principles of Community</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, covers topics on emotional intelligence, group dynamics, interpersonal communication skills and strategies, and civic responsibility, preparing the 23 student-athletes selected into the program to be leaders in their sports, in the classroom, and in their local communities.</span></p>
<p><strong>Fitness and Adventure Recreation go virtual&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to varsity athletics, Athletics and Recreation adapted quickly on multiple other fronts when the UC Santa Cruz community pivoted to remote operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department&#8217;s group exercise program, which offers a variety of classes such as kickboxing, Zumba, yoga, and HIIT, switched to a fully online format this past spring&#8212;and, much to the department&#8217;s surprise&#8212;the virtual classes have garnered an overwhelming, positive response from the campus community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We don't have a complete picture to know if virtual group exercise is more engaging than in-person group exercise offerings, but our reports are showing that virtual GX classes are keeping students engaged with their personal fitness during the pandemic,&#8221; said Clint Angus, associate director of Athletics and Recreation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are certainly looking forward to more opportunities to make our programs accessible to the UC Santa Cruz community, whether that's in person or remote. We want to make it happen for our students,&#8221; added Angus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another recreational program known as Adventure Rec, which promotes outdoor adventure experiences for students, has been offering virtual workshops this fall. From the &#8220;Getting Started in the Outdoors&#8221; series and behavioral first responder certification courses, these workshops are intended to prepare students for future Adventure Rec trips.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Staying determined while looking toward the future&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For varsity athletics, the ultimate hope for the remainder of the academic year is for each team to have some sort of season, which may or may not include in-person practices and competition play depending on COVID-19 restrictions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women's soccer, women's volleyball, women's cross country, men's cross country, and men's swimming&#8212;the five teams that won conference championships during the 2019&#8211;2020 season&#8212;want to do everything they can to retain those hard-earned titles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In spring sport news, we're excited to see the women's and men's tennis teams continue their journey to success after being recognized for two national team scholar-athlete accolades this year,&#8221; said Embele Awipi, sports information director.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless how this academic year concludes, Banana Slug student-athletes will not let the pandemic slow down their momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Athletics and Recreation staff and students prepare for the new year, they see the potential for new opportunities to arise that will further enrich the student experience, including the West Field House floor and facility renovation; the development of Physical Education courses for credit; and the expansion of the group exercise virtual library, personal and small group fitness training, Adventure Recreation orientation programs, and innovative intramural programming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Pollock put it, &#8220;The future is bright, and we couldn&#8217;t be more excited to see what comes next for our department.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

Medicine.</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this fall that puts UC Santa Cruz in the spotlight as one of the national leaders in sustainability education.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report issued a comprehensive set of recommendations for educational institutions, federal agencies, and professional societies to strengthen sustainability curricula and programs. The committee that developed it was chaired by Anne Kapuscinski, a UCSC environmental studies professor and director of the Coastal Science and Policy Program. Campus initiatives were highlighted within <a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25821/strengthening-sustainability-programs-and-curricula-at-the-undergraduate-and-graduate-levels?utm_source=NASEM+News+and+Publications&amp;utm_campaign=8ce218e6e8-Final_Book_2020_12_02_25821&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_96101de015-8ce218e6e8-103115445&amp;goal=0_96101de015-8ce218e6e8-103115445&amp;mc_cid=8ce218e6e8&amp;mc_eid=73af526ddc">the report</a> as examples of innovative sustainability education, and the findings will be presented at several upcoming national conferences.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This has helped bring more national attention to the groundbreaking sustainability work that UC Santa Cruz has done for a long time,&#8221; Kapuscinski said. &#8220;We are innovators, and we&#8217;ve been first-movers in a lot of programs that are directly relevant to sustainability, even though they might not have &#8216;sustainability&#8217; in the title.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://csp.ucsc.edu/">Coastal Science and Policy Program</a>, for example, was featured in the report for its intensive use of experiential learning to build sustainability leadership skills. Graduate students in the program spend a year embedded with a partner organization to implement a co-designed capstone project that delivers scalable solutions to a coastal sustainability challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re immersing students in a much deeper way,&#8221; Kapuscinski explained. &#8220;They&#8217;re challenged to figure out how to address complex problems and develop solutions in a real-world setting, and to navigate all its nuances.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee that produced the report held one of its national workshops at the UC Santa Cruz Coastal Science Campus as part of the development process. During their visit, they also toured the <a href="https://casfs.ucsc.edu/">Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems</a> (CASFS) and learned how it uses the campus as a living laboratory and forges tight connections between formal curricula and hands-on practice.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;CASFS has been doing that for many years, long before the recent flourishing of sustainability education programs nationally and internationally,&#8221; said Kapuscinski.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experiential learning was one of the report&#8217;s main recommendations, alongside fostering interdisciplinary approaches and building diversity, equity, and inclusion. Campus leaders see both strength areas and growth opportunities among those themes. Diversity was a primary focus for Kapuscinski and the committee in developing the report, and Social Sciences Division dean Katharyne Mitchell was thrilled to see that message come across loud and clear in the final product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bringing in diversity of experience is still a growth area for us, even though we have long aspired to it and worked toward it,&#8221; Mitchell said. &#8220;You have to be really proactive and do the work to attract people to your programs and establish a climate that helps people succeed.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell had an opportunity to speak with the committee during the workshop held at UCSC, as did Erika Zavaleta, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. Zavaleta leads initiatives like the Center to Advance Mentored, Inquiry-based Opportunities in Ecology and Conservation (<a href="https://camino.ucsc.edu/about-us/">CAMINO</a>) and the <a href="https://conservationscholars.ucsc.edu/">Doris Duke Conservation Scholars</a> program, both of which are working to increase diversity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The interest is absolutely there to be able to recruit people from a huge diversity of backgrounds to sustainability work,&#8221; Zavaleta said. &#8220;It's an issue of sharing leadership and agency in the field enough that all of that diversity can be reflected in what sustainability is and how it&#8217;s pursued.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zavaleta says the Doris Duke Conservation Scholars and CAMINO programs have developed successful support models that focus on community-building, outreach, and representation in leadership. Now, she&#8217;s working to share those insights across the campus community and beyond.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz programs also have important lessons to share when it comes to fostering interdisciplinarity. The <a href="https://envs.ucsc.edu/">Environmental Studies Department</a> offers a doctoral program and five undergraduate programs&#8212;including a new agroecology major&#8212;all of which combine education in natural sciences and social sciences. Department chair Weixin Cheng says he&#8217;s found that true collaboration across disciplines requires the right culture among faculty.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our departmental members have this mindset that we are solving these environmental problems together,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;We can be very different in terms of our perspectives and training, but the goal is always shared.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz also offers an interdisciplinary <a href="https://rachelcarson.ucsc.edu/academics/Minor/Index.html">sustainability minor</a> housed at the Rachel Carson College. That program emphasizes green entrepreneurship, along with sustainable design for the built environment. Cross-cutting skills like those are increasingly in demand on the job market, and the new report&#8217;s official endorsement of interdisciplinary education could help to accelerate that trend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, each of the report&#8217;s recommendations are intended to help the field of sustainability grow in the right direction. That goal inspired Professor Anne Kapuscinski to accept the chair position on the committee in the first place. And looking back, she&#8217;s glad she did.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It really was a labor of love,&#8221; Kapuscinski said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of work to serve on a National Academies committee, but you learn so much from it and get to contribute to the national dialogue on timely issues. It was both an honor to lead and a joy to collaborate with the other national leaders on this committee.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="31c3ffce807270172c1b96bd0914231d"><name>new-interim-policy-medications-clinic</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New Interim Policy on the Use of Externally Supplied Medications in UC Outpatient and Clinic Settings</title><start-date>1606809600000</start-date><display-name>New Interim Policy on the Use of Externally Supplied Medications in UC Outpatient and Clinic Settings</display-name><path>/2020/12/new-interim-policy-medications-clinic</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/12/new-interim-policy-medications-clinic</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1607152697259</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1607152697259</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p class="p1">UC President Michael V. Drake, MD, has announced a new interim policy addressing the use of externally supplied medications in UC outpatient and clinical settings. The policy is <a href="https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/5000694/ExternalMedications-InterimPolicy"><span class="s1">available online</span></a> and effective immediately.</p>
<p class="p3">This interim policy is intended to mitigate against the potential risks to patient safety, and the associated product liability risk to then University, associated with commercial health plan practices that attempt to require health care providers to accept medications procured from an external pharmacy, bypassing the UC Health pharmacy and the checks and balances that exist to ensure that each UC Health patient receives the correct medication, that the drug has been stored appropriately, and that the medication arrives at the time of the patient&#8217;s appointment to be administered to the patient.</p>
<p class="p3">It is the policy of the University to California that the responsibility and accountability for purchasing, mixing, and administering injectable medications to patients who receive care at University of California hospital outpatient clinics, ambulatory clinics, and student health centers, resides solely with UC Health pharmacists, and the physicians, nurses, and physician assistants who administer the drugs. In order to be able to assure the legitimacy of the original drug source and the appropriateness of subsequent storage and handling of any drug to be administered to a patient, UC Health will not administer any drug to a patient that UC Health does not purchase directly from either the manufacturer or an accredited wholesaler.</p>
<p class="p3">UC Health remains committed to offering the University&#8217;s self-funded plans and other health plans price transparency and predictability for plans&#8217; coverage of&#8212;and expenditures for&#8212;injectable medications. These efforts are intended to provide health plans more predictability to manage their prescription drug benefit expenditures, which in turn will help the health plans manage costs for health insurance coverage to employers.</p>

<p>Rebecca DuBois, associate professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz, said the new method her team developed is as accurate as the most reliable antibody tests currently available, but is less complex and can be performed much faster.</p>
<p>The gold standard for serological testing is a complex laboratory method called ELISA that takes four to six hours to run and provides quantitative results indicating the strength of the immune response. Simpler assays using test strips provide rapid results, but are less reliable and do not quantify antibody levels.</p>
<p>The new method, called biolayer interferometry immunosorbent assay (BLI-ISA), provides complete quantitative results in less than 20 minutes. DuBois and her colleagues described the assay in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78895-x">paper published December 10 in <em>Scientific Reports</em></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our assay is as sensitive if not better than other assays in detecting low levels of antibodies, and the specificity [false-positive rate] is as good as the best antibody tests out there,&#8221; DuBois said. &#8220;It combines the advantages of the test strips that take 20 minutes with the quantitative results and higher performance of ELISA.&#8221;</p>
<p>A positive antibody test indicates prior infection with the virus. These tests are not used to diagnose active infections, however, which requires a different test that detects the virus&#8217;s genetic material or the virus antigens. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system that recognize and bind to virus antigens.</p>
<p>Serological testing is important for understanding the spread of the coronavirus by determining how many people in a population have been infected. The tests are also used to evaluate the responses to experimental vaccines in both people and laboratory animals. Quantitative information about antibody levels could be especially important in the future if scientists are able to determine that a certain level of particular antibodies is needed to provide protection against infection with the coronavirus.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is still to be determined, but we do know that people who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 have very diverse levels of antibodies, and it would not be surprising to find that below some baseline level they might not be protective,&#8221; DuBois said. &#8220;So it&#8217;s really useful to have that quantitative ability to know what someone&#8217;s antibody status is, whether it&#8217;s from a past infection or a vaccination.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Fiber-optic biosensor<br/></strong></p>
<p>The new BLI-ISA method uses biolayer interferometry, an optical technique for measuring the interactions between molecules by detecting the binding of molecules to the tip of a fiber-optic biosensor. The instruments required to perform biolayer interferometry are increasingly common in research laboratories. The BLI instrument at UCSC is used by several research groups, and DuBois has been using it in her research to study antibody-antigen interactions.</p>
<p>The new serological assay involves several steps performed by the instrument in an automated &#8220;dip-and-read&#8221; format. In the first step, the biosensor tip is dipped into a solution containing the antigen (a viral protein) that is recognized by the antibody to be tested for. As the antigen binds to the biosensor tip, it generates a signal that can be used for quality control to ensure consistency in the antigen loading step. Next, after dipping into a wash solution, the biosensor is dipped into the blood plasma sample, generating a signal as antibodies bind to the antigen.</p>
<p>The immune system makes different types of antibodies, called isotypes, including IgM, which is produced early in the infection and declines later, and IgG, which is produced later and persists longer. In the antibody binding step, the BLI instrument detects any type of antibody that binds to the antigen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Depending on when the blood sample was taken after infection, there might be different types of antibodies, and this step gives us the total antibody level,&#8221; DuBois said.</p>
<p>The next step detects and quantifies IgG antibodies specifically by measuring the binding of anti-IgG antibodies. The assay thereby provides quantitative measurements of both total antibodies and IgG antibodies, and it can be designed to measure different isotypes as well.</p>
<p><strong>Spike protein</strong></p>
<p>In response to infection with the coronavirus, the immune system makes antibodies against a range of different coronavirus antigens. Most serological testing methods for SARS-CoV-2 are designed to detect antibodies to structural proteins of the virus such as the spike protein, which studs the surface of the virus and enables it to bind to and enter human cells. Antibodies to one part of the spike protein&#8212;the receptor binding domain, or RBD&#8212;are of particular interest because they are effective at neutralizing the virus in laboratory assays.</p>
<p>DuBois&#8217;s team developed and tested the new assay using RBD antigens, but she noted that it can be used to detect a wide range of antigens. The BLI instrument allows easy &#8220;multiplexing,&#8221; meaning that multiple tests can be run in parallel on the same blood sample to detect antibodies to different viral antigens as well as different antibody isotypes.</p>
<p>Because it requires laboratory equipment, BLI-ISA could not be used as a point-of-care test at doctor&#8217;s offices or pharmacies. But it allows high-throughput processing of samples and is faster and less labor intensive than other quantitative laboratory tests such as ELISA, Immunofluorescent Assay, and Chemiluminescent Immunoassay. The amount of blood needed for the test can be obtained with a finger prick.</p>
<p>Another advantage of BLI-ISA over other methods is the ease of standardizing the assay so that a sample gives the same quantitative results in repeated tests at different times or in different laboratories. ELISA requires an enzyme-based signal amplification step, which can vary depending on temperature and other factors, resulting in much more test-to-test variability in the quantitative measurements.</p>
<p>First author John Dzimianski, a postdoctoral researcher in DuBois&#8217;s lab, said the new assay could be especially useful for researchers in vaccine development. &#8220;This method provides a standardized way to quantify antibody levels, which could be used to compare antibody responses to different vaccine candidates. In addition, running the assay itself is straightforward, requiring little more than the push of a button,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a simple but powerful tool.&#8221;</p>
<p>DuBois&#8217;s team is also interested in using the assay to conduct a surveillance study to assess the prevalence of coronavirus infections in certain groups in the Santa Cruz community. The team is exploring funding opportunities for this research project.</p>
<p>In addition to DuBois and Dzimianski, the authors of the new study include graduate student Nicholas Lorig-Roach; project scientist Sarah O&#8217;Rourke; Jacqueline Kimmey, assistant professor of microbiology and environmental toxicology; and David Alexander at Ontera, a Santa Cruz biotech company.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the transition is actually creating more jobs, many of the new positions are platform-based, which often means workers are hired as independent contractors making lower wages and lacking employment protections or benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Berkeley Labor Center and Working Partnerships USA commissioned Benner to develop </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/delivering-insecurity-ecommerce-and-the-future-of-work-in-food-retail/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and he and his collaborators had been studying labor conditions within grocery retail for several years prior to the pandemic. Originally, they wanted to better understand the industry because it&#8217;s one of the largest job sectors within the U.S. food system. But, recently, their work took on new meaning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This became even more important in the context of the pandemic because these are essential workers,&#8221; Benner said. &#8220;They&#8217;re helping to get food to people sheltered in place at home. They&#8217;re putting themselves at risk in fulfilling and delivering food orders. And I think our findings highlight the inequalities and problems that exist in some portion of the grocery and food delivery industry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report shows that, since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, growing numbers of Americans have experimented with ordering groceries online for delivery or pickup. During the most recent peak of lock-downs in May, as much as a quarter of all grocery sales were ordered digitally. Revenue from online orders has doubled or even tripled for major grocery chains.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some of the factors fueling this rapid change are likely to recede post-pandemic, moderate levels of e-commerce growth within the grocery industry are here to stay. The good news is, the report shows that e-commerce has not been a job killer. Instead, the expansion of e-commerce technologies in the grocery industry is leading to new jobs, as customers pay for work they used to do themselves for free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jobs are being created in roles like gathering grocery items for order fulfillment, completing parts of the meal prep process for customers, and facilitating curbside pickup or delivery of groceries. The report documented a decline in cashiering positions, but overall, e-commerce has created new types of jobs and expanded employment options at brick-and-mortar stores.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge arises with how these new jobs operate. Traditionally, grocery retail employees have made above minimum wage and had relatively high rates of unionization. But e-commerce platforms have brought the gig economy model of independent contractor labor to the industry. As a result, much of the food delivery and order fulfillment work that has been created is now being done without benefits and with much less predictable income.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the report shows that there are other viable labor models that could maintain job quality. Among larger grocery store chains, there are several examples of in-house, unionized employees doing the same types of order fulfillment and delivery tasks as app-based workers, but with more protections and better wages.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benner and the report&#8217;s coauthors argue that regulation of gig employment in the industry could help promote beneficial business practices. Policy action has become especially important in the wake of the recent passage of Proposition 22, which exempted app-based workers from state-mandated employment protections in California.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation to narrow independent contractor classifications and expand access to health coverage and benefits could allow industries like grocery retail to benefit from e-commerce growth while protecting workers, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s a popular misconception that it&#8217;s inevitable that technology will impact the workforce, but that hides all the decisions and choices that are made within that,&#8221; Benner said. &#8220;Technology can change things in pretty dramatic ways, but it&#8217;s still shaped by political forces, business forces, cultural norms, and human tendencies.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4de0a36f807270172c1b96bd9cd9fcbb"><name>text-to-911-service-now-available</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Text-to-911 service now available</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz community can now text 911 to request emergency help from the campus dispatch center.

<p>Often described as the &#8216;father of fiber optics,&#8217; Kapany introduced the term in a 1960 article in <em>Scientific American</em>, wrote the first book about the new field, and played a prominent role in advancing the field both as a researcher and as the founder of several optical technology companies.</p>
<p>Kapany was a Regents Professor at UC Santa Cruz from 1977 to 1983. In 2008, he was honored with the UC Santa Cruz Foundation&#8217;s Fiat Lux Award in recognition of his outstanding achievement, dedication, and service in support of the university&#8217;s programs and goals.</p>
<p>Kapany established two endowed chairs at UC Santa Cruz: the Narinder Singh Kapany Chair in Optoelectronics in the Baskin School of Engineering in 1999 and the Narinder Kapany Professor in Entrepreneurship in 2012. Another gift to the campus in 2017 established the Sundar Singh Kapany Book Collection and the Sundar Singh Kapany Group Study Room in the University Library.</p>
<p>Born in India, Kapany went to England for graduate school and spent the bulk of his career in the United States. A graduate of Agra University in India, he completed advanced studies in optics at Imperial College London and received his Ph.D. from the University of London in 1955. As a graduate student working alongside Harold Hopkins at Imperial College in 1953, Kapany was the first to successfully transmit high-quality images through a bundle of optical fibers.</p>
<p>His research and inventions have encompassed fiber-optics communications, lasers, biomedical instrumentation, solar energy, and pollution monitoring. He started several companies in Silicon Valley, earned over 120 patents, and was a member of the National Inventors Council. A fellow of numerous scientific societies including the British Royal Academy of Engineering, the Optical Society of America, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, he received many awards and honors, including the Excellence 2000 Award from the USA Pan-Asian American Chamber of Commerce and the Pravasi Bharati Samman Award from the Government of India.</p>
<p>Kapany founded UCSC&#8217;s <a href="https://cied.ucsc.edu/">Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development (CIED)</a>. As its first director, he was instrumental in convening national thought leaders in academia, industry, and government to discuss and learn about the role and impact that&#160;innovation and entrepreneurship play within the university.</p>
<p>A noted philanthropist, Kapany was deeply committed to championing Sikh culture and language, creating the Sikh Foundation in 1967. In 1998, he endowed a Chair of Sikh Studies at UC Santa Barbara. He donated his family&#8217;s collection of Sikh art to the San Francisco Asian Art Museum and funded a gallery for its display in 1999.</p>
<p>Kapany is survived by his son Rajinder Singh Kapany, daughter Kiran Kaur Kapany, and four grandchildren, Ariana, Misha, Tara and Nikki.

They are sections of DNA found at the ends of each of our chromosomes, and they consist of the same sequence of bases repeated over and over.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Telomeres&#8221; is just a fancy scientific term for &#8220;the ends of a chromosome.&#8217;&#8217;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These end-points are often compared to the plastic protective covers on the tips of shoelaces. Much biological research overlooked the lowly telomere, preferring to focus on the chromosome as a whole.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But telomeres play an oversized role in human health, with implications for bone marrow and cancer research. On Tuesday, Nobel laureate and UC Santa Cruz </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">distinguished professor of molecular, cell, and developmental (MCD) biology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> professor Carol Greider delved deeply into those impacts during her fast-paced webinar, part of the Kraw Lecture series on science and technology.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greider emphasized that many of the discoveries regarding telomeres were the end result of scientific curiosity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Curiosity-driven research provides unexpected discoveries that give us insight into biology,&#8217;&#8217; Greider said. She and her colleagues in the science community did not set out to understand how shortened telomeres play a decisive role in bone marrow failure and pulmonary fibrosis. &#8220;We just wanted to know what happened when telomeres are not maintained,&#8217;&#8217; she said. &#8220;By following our curiosity, we were able to understand these aspects of disease."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greider&#8217;s technical knowledge and innovations have made her famous in the scientific community. She s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hared the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her pioneering work on telomeres, the critical structures that maintain the ends of chromosomes, and the discovery of telomerase, the enzyme that maintains telomere length.</span>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before joining the UC Santa Cruz faculty this year, Greider, an eminent biologist and a staunch advocate for diversity in science, was the Bloomberg Distinguished Professor, Daniel Nathans Professor, and department director for Molecular Biology and Genetics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greider discovered telomerase as a graduate student in Elizabeth Blackburn&#8217;s laboratory at UC Berkeley.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She will establish a new laboratory at UC Santa Cruz to continue her telomere research program.</span></p>
<p><strong>A guided tour through the telomere&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her breadth of experience will make her an invaluable asset to research on campus.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But the Kraw Lecture showed that Greider also has a knack for science communication. In the hour-long talk, she was able to distill complicated truths that were legible even to those who had no idea telomeres existed at all, let alone play crucial roles in human life.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telomeres are an essential part of the cell-division process. They are sections of DNA found at the ends of each of our chromosomes, and they consist of the same sequence of bases repeated over and over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without them, cell division would grind to a halt. Scientists have also found that the repeated divisions of cells gradually shortens the lengths of the telomeres. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After several divisions, telomeres eventually become so short, stumpy, and compromised that a process known as &#8220;cell death&#8217;&#8217; is triggered.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This degradation led to a scientific mystery: If telomeres lose their length and integrity with each cell division, how is it that life persists?&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, what, exactly, is making those cells keep on dividing even when the telomeres keep getting shrunken down?&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greider was part of the scientific team that figured out the answer: As it turns out, an enzyme called telomerase restores the missing telomere repeats back to the ends of chromosomes, compensating for the problem of gradual shortening.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Te</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lomerase is essential for cancer cells&#8217; rapid-fire division. This has prompted scientists to look into the possibility of shortening telomeres as part of cancer treatment. It makes a lot of sense on the surface; if you somehow disable an essential mechanism that helps cancer cells propagate before it&#8217;s too late, couldn&#8217;t you halt the cancer in its tracks?&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mice research has shown that this is indeed the case. Short telomeres can stop </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cell division, including the division of cancer cells. But what happens to normal and healthy cells when telomeres are allowed to shrink down, without the intervention of telomerase? The implications can be dire.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>The long and short of it</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While shortened telomeres can arrest cancer growth, this same decline is also linked to health problems such as bone marrow failure as well as pulmonary fibrosis, a lung disease. Such problems can worsen over subsequent generations, Greider said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insufficient immune function, emphysema predisposition, intolerance of chemo, liver cirrhosis, and GI disease are all linked to diminished telomere length. The progressive shortening of telomeres in cells over time also leads to prematurely gray hair and infertility of the testes, she said.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The health implications of telomere length shrinkage and telomere length maintenance create a conundrum for scientists. If the telomeres are continuously maintained, this can lead to cancer, but if they become too short, it can lead to stem cell failure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This makes us think very critically about what would happen if you shortened telomeres to treat cancer,&#8221; Greider said. &#8220;Would you put (patients) at risk for stem-cell failures? And if you treated degenerative diseases by maintaining telomere lengths, would you subject them to cancer risk? It helps us think about the implications of such interventions.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greider closed her talk with a word of caution about profiteers who are misinterpreting and misrepresenting telomere science to sell skin creams and other products that make dubious claims about sustaining youth. &#8220;My take home message is, don&#8217;t believe everything you read,&#8217;&#8217; she advised. &#8220;Telomeres are important to age-related diseases, but a lot of people want to sell you things. You need to be skeptical.&#8221; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="52fb6aee807270172c1b96bddc37d47e"><name>greider-nai</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Biologist Carol Greider elected a Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors</title><summary>Carol Greider, distinguished professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, has been named a Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors.</summary><start-date>1607673600000</start-date><display-name>Biologist Carol Greider elected a Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors</display-name><path>/2020/12/greider-nai</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/12/greider-nai</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1607709977300</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1607710119232</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/12/images/carol-greider-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/12/images/carol-greider-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>carol-greider-300.jpg</name><display-name>carol-greider-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>87091</file-size><width>300</width><height>352</height></image><image-alt>Carol Greider</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/12/images/carol-greider-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/12/images/carol-greider-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>carol-greider-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>carol-greider-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25571</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Carol Greider</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Carol Greider (Photo by C.

<p>The NAI Fellows Program highlights academic inventors who have demonstrated &#8220;a highly prolific spirit of innovation in creating or facilitating outstanding inventions that have made a tangible impact on quality of life, economic development, and the welfare of society.&#8221; Election to NAI Fellow is the highest professional distinction accorded solely to academic inventors.</p>
<p>Greider shared the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her pioneering work on telomeres, critical structures that maintain the ends of chromosomes, and the discovery of telomerase, the enzyme that maintains telomere length. Telomeres are stretches of repetitive DNA at the ends of chromosomes, and telomere shortening is associated with aging and disease.

<p>In his new book, <em>How Pac-Man Eats</em> (MIT Press, December 2020), Noah Wardrip-Fruin argues that these two aspects of games are intrinsically linked, and that a new game can fail if there is a mismatch between the game&#8217;s mechanics and its theme.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the big questions is how we can make games that are about things like social or political or personal topics, given the limited vocabulary for how games can work,&#8221; said Wardrip-Fruin, a professor of computational media at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In the new book, he shows how game developers build playable models using a vocabulary of what he calls &#8220;operational logics.&#8221; He then explores what kinds of themes can be addressed with different kinds of playable models.</p>
<p>&#8220;I talk about some failed examples, like a version of <em>Tetris</em> that was about slavery, or a version of <em>Monopoly</em> about a boy band,&#8221; Wardrip-Fruin said. &#8220;If there&#8217;s no relationship between how the game is played and its theme, it doesn&#8217;t work, but many people, including some game makers, don&#8217;t seem to be able to look at the system of a game and think about what that system can express.&#8221;</p>
<p>The relationship between the underlying system and the theme can be relatively direct, but it can also be powerfully metaphorical, he explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s something that artificial intelligence would have a hard time with, because it&#8217;s hard to predict metaphorical uses,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a feat of creativity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The book&#8217;s title refers to what was at the time a breakthrough in the metaphorical use of game mechanics, although now it seems so obvious it&#8217;s hard to recognize how innovative it was. One of the fundamental elements in the vocabulary of game mechanics is collision, which was used effectively in the early videogame <em>Pong</em> to bounce a ball back and forth between two paddles. <em>Pac-Man</em> introduced a new approach, expanding the use of collision to &#8220;mean&#8221; consuming something, as Pac-Man eats pellets scattered around a maze.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the time, that was a big deal, but now we can barely see it as anything special,&#8221; Wardrip-Fruin said. &#8220;In more recent games, collision is used to mean many different things. Another common element is resource logic, like the use of money in <em>Monopoly</em>, which has been used in other games to say different things about how resources exist in our world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The book describes strategies game creators use to expand what can be said through games, with examples drawn from indie games, art games, and research games that address themes ranging from border policy to gender transition. These include <em>Papers, Please</em>, which illustrates expansive uses of pattern matching; <em>Prom Week</em>, for which the game's developers at UCSC created a model of social volition to enable richer relationships between characters; and <em>Dys4ia</em>, which demonstrates a design approach that supports game metaphors of high complexity.</p>
<p>Wardrip-Fruin is codirector of the Expressive Intelligence Studio at UC Santa Cruz. His previous book, also from MIT Press, is <em>Expressive Processing: Digital Fictions, Computer Games, and Software Studies</em>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/how-pac-man-revolutionized-gaming/</url><title>How

correctional officers have died.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;&#160;</span></i></span></p>
<p><span>&#8212;New York Times, December 7, 2020</span><span></span><span></span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.unjustlyexposed.com"><strong><em>&#8220;EXPOSED</em>&#8221;</strong></a></span><span><i> </i>is a new web project that documents the spread of COVID-19 over time&#8212;inside prisons, jails, and detention centers&#8212;from the perspective of prisoners and their families.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>UCSC film and digital media professor Sharon Daniel has taken quotes, audio clips, and statistics, collected from a comprehensive array of publications and broadcasts, and assembled them into an interactive timeline that offers endless testimony to the risk and trauma that prisoners are experiencing under coronavirus quarantine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The design of the interface allows viewers to step through thousands of &#8216;headline-style&#8217; quote sequences and audio clips, each linking to its original source.The project also includes an autoplay feature that cycles through the statements with no interaction needed&#8212;designed for exhibitions and screenings in museums and galleries during the pandemic period when gallery visitors cannot be asked to touch surfaces in public spaces.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The scale of the project is intended to reflect the scale of the crisis,&#8221; said Daniel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160; </span>&#8220;At this moment the autoplay version takes well over 24 hours to run from beginning to end.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Since the first reported coronavirus infection in the U.S., incarcerated people have been subjected to extreme forms of isolation&#8212;visits have been suspended, phone privileges restricted, and the use of solitary confinement expanded exponentially,&#8221; Daniel added. </span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Prisoners are stranded in quarantine without adequate food or medication&#8212;abandoned and unseen. Unfortunately, given this isolation, their words are all we have. The monochrome, image-less, headline-styled interface, which allows viewers to step through thousands of prisoners&#8217; statements, is designed to visualize the collective nature of their suffering and signal that the injustices they endure are structural.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Daniel&#8217;s research has focused on injustice in the criminal punishment system for a number of years, so she was well aware that prisons and jails are incubators and amplifiers of infectious diseases where social distancing and basic sanitation are impossible. She noted that when the first coronavirus infections in the U.S. were reported, she was reasonably certain that corrections officers would ultimately walk the virus into prisons, and it would then spread like wildfire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The first positive case among prisoners in California was reported on March 22,&#8221; said Daniel. &#8220;By late March/early April, I was spending hours scouring the news for information about the impact of the virus on incarcerated people. And while mainstream media and local news stations were reporting on the issue, only niche/specialist publications focused on criminal justice reform were providing consistent coverage and collecting data. So I decided that it was important, to me at least, to find a way to start documenting the spread of the virus in prisons, and jails and detention centers, from the perspective of prisoners and their families.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Daniel launched the project on October 30, in conjunction with the <i>Barring Freedoms</i> exhibition opening at the San Jose Museum of Art.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I wanted to create a cumulative public record and evolving history of the pandemic&#8217;s impact on incarcerated people,&#8221; said Daniel. &#8220;My hope is to increase awareness of the critical danger that COVID-19 presents in prisons and jails, and demonstrate that the criminal punishment system itself constitutes a public health crisis.&#8220;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.unjustlyexposed.com"><em><strong>Exposed</strong></em></a><span> is the latest in a series<i> </i>of new media <a href="http://www.sharondaniel.net/#about"><strong><em>documentary projects</em></strong></a><i> </i>created by Daniel that reveal social and economic injustice across public institutions, including the criminal justice system, the prison industrial complex, the public health system, and the public education system.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Through interactive web documentaries and installations, her projects document and analyze testimony and evidence to illustrate how state institutions, social structures, and economic conditions connect in a causal chain that fosters and perpetuates social injustice.</span></p>

<p>Fortunately, UC Santa Cruz planned from the beginning to steadily ramp up the lab&#8217;s testing capacity and has been able to acquire additional equipment and add new staff. The lab now routinely runs more than 800 tests in a day, with weekly totals often exceeding 3,000 tests. So far, the lab has been able to meet the demand for tests from its partners and continues to return results within 24 to 48 hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;The numbers fluctuate. We have seen big spikes from some of our partners, but our model is to be responsive to emergencies, and we are working to address their needs,&#8221; said Isabel Bjork, executive director of the UCSC Genomics Institute.</p>
<p>A generous gift from Bud and Rebecca Colligan is providing crucial funding to expand COVID-19 testing capacity and construct a new, dedicated laboratory space to house the diagnostic lab in the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute facilities at the Westside Research Park. The lab will be known as the Colligan Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory in recognition of their support.</p>
<p>Conceived and launched within a remarkably short time, the lab has been serving the needs of the Santa Cruz community during the COVID-19 pandemic since May 1, 2020. It has been operating in provisional lab space on the UCSC campus that is now needed for faculty research. The move to a permanent location at the Westside Research Park will take place early in the new year and is not expected to disrupt the lab&#8217;s operations.</p>
<p><strong>Certified clinical laboratory</strong></p>
<p>The Colligan Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory will be a certified clinical laboratory, featuring dedicated space to ensure cleanliness, prevent contamination, and accommodate an increase in testing capacity. This new laboratory provides permanent space that will enable the campus to expand its COVID-19 diagnostic testing to help ensure the region can manage and address public health and safety.</p>
<p>The Colligans said they were particularly motivated by the lab&#8217;s focus on providing testing for low-income populations and those without access to private health insurance, as well as providing an immediate response when there are outbreaks in the community that need to be contained.</p>
<p>&#8220;For us, the real driving factor is that the UCSC testing lab is serving as a first line of defense for vulnerable populations and first responders in the community,&#8221; said Bud Colligan, CEO of South Swell Ventures and cofounder and board member of the Monterey Bay Economic Partnership.</p>
<p>Bud and Rebecca Colligan are longtime supporters of the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute. A previous gift from them created an endowment for the Colligan Presidential Chair in Pediatric Genomics held by Olena Vaske, an assistant professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology and one of several UCSC faculty members who led the effort to get the diagnostic lab established and who now serve as faculty advisers. In the long term, the Colligan Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory will be able to provide clinical support for Vaske&#8217;s work in pediatric cancer genomics.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are pleased to support the important work of UCSC in addressing the immediate need in our community for increased COVID-19 testing, as well as a long-term vision to use the lab for clinical research and testing related to pediatric cancers,&#8221; said Rebecca Colligan.</p>
<p><strong>New hires</strong></p>
<p>The lab has made several new hires in recent months to meet staffing needs, including additional certified diagnostic technicians and a new lab director. Susan Weaver, the director designee, is the clinical laboratory director at Natividad Medical Center in Salinas and lives in Aptos. She oversees a staff of 14 at the UCSC diagnostic lab and is taking over the director&#8217;s role from Dr. Ralph Green, professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at UC Davis.</p>
<p>&#8220;As our lab and staff growth shows, we are committed to serving our community through provision of highly accurate tests with quick turn-around time. We are constantly improving our operations in an effort to meet ever-growing needs,&#8221; said John MacMillan, associate vice chancellor for research and professor of chemistry and biochemistry.</p>
<p>As the new lab space comes online in 2021, it is expected that demand for testing will continue to increase to over 6,000 tests per week for the campus and community partners. The campus is providing surveillance and symptomatic COVID-19 testing for its own students, faculty, and staff, and it is also providing testing by agreement to local organizations that serve diverse low-income populations, including Santa Cruz Community Health and Salud Para La Gente. The campus is also partnering with Santa Cruz County Public Health and the Santa Cruz Community Foundation to provide testing for various local community medical providers and public service entities on a short-term, immediate basis, to address emergency needs.</p>
<p>The UCSC diagnostic lab offers testing to sites identified as critical by Santa Cruz Public Health and is taking on new partners that serve frontline workers, such as firefighters, and vulnerable and high-risk communities, such as care homes and homeless populations. The campus maintains a commitment to participating in the community testing effort as long as this lab can be helpful in that sphere. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic will be a crucial need for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>In the long term, the laboratory will provide an adaptable, dedicated clinical testing facility that will be used for breakthroughs in precision medicine.

<p>Grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded the acquisition of a new electron microscope and camera needed to perform cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), a revolutionary technique for determining the 3-dimensional shapes of large proteins and nucleic acids and the complex assemblies of those molecules that drive the vital functions of living cells.</p>
<p>&#8220;A growing community of structural biologists at UCSC is excited to exploit the potential of this technology,&#8221; said Melissa Jurica, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental (MCD) biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Structural biologists in several departments at UCSC are doing important work to understand the molecular machinery that operates in the cells of our bodies and underlies human health and disease. This includes research on structures such as the ribosome, spliceosome, cell-cycle regulators, circadian clocks, immune response regulators, childhood viruses, and more.</p>
<p><strong>High-end instruments</strong></p>
<p>Jurica set up UCSC&#8217;s first electron microscope with cryogenic capabilities when she joined the faculty in 2003. Cryo-EM technology has improved greatly since then, and in recent years, UCSC researchers have had to go to other institutions to use the latest high-end instruments. Now, they can do the work here and train their students to use state-of-the-art equipment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cryo-EM has gone through a revolution in the past five years or so, made possible by improvements in the technology of the microscopes and the cameras,&#8221; Jurica said. &#8220;UCSC has a very strong group of structural biologists who need this technology. We all worked together to build this facility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jurica led the application for the $1.6 million NIH High-End Instrumentation grant that funded the purchase of the new cryo-electron microscope, which includes an &#8220;autoloader&#8221; device that loads the samples and vastly increases both through-put and stability of the instrument.</p>
<p>Seth Rubin, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and Harry Noller, professor emeritus of MCD biology, got a separate NIH grant to purchase the specialized camera, a direct electron detector, which is a critical component for achieving high-resolution images of molecular structures. The campus administration, meanwhile, funded renovations for the new facility in the Sinsheimer Laboratories building.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re now in a position to do a lot of really good work,&#8221; Jurica said.</p>
<p>Users of the facility will include nearly a dozen faculty members in the Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry, MCD Biology, Biomolecular Engineering, and Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology. The new facility was crucial to the hiring of a new faculty member, Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry Sarah Loerch, who uses cutting-edge cryo-EM methods to study the structure and function of RNA-protein complexes. Focusing on specialized ribosomal complexes, the Loerch lab is working to understand how a cell instructs ribosomes to make the right protein at the right time and in the right place.</p>
<p><strong>Crystallography</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally, the preferred technique for determining the structures of complex biomolecules has been x-ray crystallography. This was the method used by Noller and others to determine the structure of the ribosome, a molecular machine composed of multiple proteins and RNAs that performs protein synthesis in all cells. But x-ray crystallography requires crystallizing the structures first, an extremely challenging step for many biological molecules.</p>
<p>Cryo-EM doesn&#8217;t require crystals, and its use has grown dramatically as the methods and equipment have improved. The technique involves flash-freezing samples to capture flexible and dynamic biological molecules in static poses. &#8220;With cryo-EM, we can now get direct, high-resolution images of molecules that were not possible to crystallize,&#8221; Jurica said.</p>
<p>Noller plans to use cryo-EM images of a ribosome at different steps of protein synthesis to create a molecular movie of the process. With x-ray crystallography, this would require many months of trying to get a crystal for each frame of the movie, but cryo-EM makes it much faster and easier to do. Loerch plans to take the technology one step further and actually image ribosomes while they are inside a neuron to determine how the ribosomes are instructed to make proteins in response to a synapse firing.</p>
<p>Jurica&#8217;s lab will be looking at the splicing machinery that edits the RNAs copied from genes; Rebecca Dubois, associate professor of biomolecular engineering, will be looking at the structure of viruses to aid in vaccine development; and Carrie Partch, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, will be using cryo-EM to look at how all the parts of the circadian clock work together to maintain the daily rhythms of our cells.</p>
<p>All of these molecules are large and change their shapes constantly as they do their cellular jobs, which means crystallography would take decades, and might never work. &#8220;Cryo-EM lets us take a short-cut straight to the molecules,&#8221; Jurica said.</p>
<p>Support from multiple departments and divisions, as well as from campus administration, enabled UCSC to build the new cryo-EM facility, she said. The new facility will open in the new year.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6276c225807270172c1b96bd7fea2b93"><name>2021-summer-session</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>2021 Summer Session remote courses launch </title><start-date>1607673600000</start-date><display-name>2021 Summer Session</display-name><path>/2020/12/2021-summer-session</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/12/2021-summer-session</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1607969718797</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1607969752078</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>Campus Updates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Course offerings for UC Santa Cruz Summer Session are now listed at summer.ucsc.edu.

That&#8217;s not true. You can&#8217;t pull that off.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>These were my thoughts the first time I heard Second Harvest Food Bank&#8217;s incredible claim for how they feed so many hungry people. Yet, four years later, I&#8217;m now leading the <a href="https://holidayfooddrive.ucsc.edu/index.html">UCSC Holiday Food &amp; Fund Drive</a> that supports the food bank&#8217;s effort to feed our local and campus community in Santa Cruz County. Turns out, their claim was true! Second Harvest Food Bank can <strong>feed a family of four with only $1</strong> because of their <a href="https://www.thefoodbank.org/aboutus/where-our-food-comes-from/">extensive relationships</a> with farmers, retailers, food bank networks, and dedicated volunteers.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s just one person&#8217;s SHFB story. Since the food bank can create four meals for every $1 donated through <a href="https://give.thefoodbank.org/teams/14669-uc-santa-cruz">UCSC&#8217;s fundraising page</a>, we&#8217;ll share 4 stories about this 1 food drive.</p>
<p>The other three stories come from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chancellor, Cindy Larive</li>
<li>Director of Basic Needs, Kednel Jean</li>
<li>Past Lead of the HFFD (and UCSC alum), John Steele</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chancellor Cindy Larive is a strong advocate of helping feed hope by fighting food insecurity. I asked her why the work of Second Harvest Food Bank inspires her to contribute her time and resources to support them...</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Most people are aware that food insecurity exists in Santa Cruz County. However, not many people know of the robust partnership that exists between UCSC and Second Harvest Food Bank to combat food insecurity for both students and employees. I am especially proud of two aspects of our partnership: First, that SHFB contributes personnel resources to our students&#8217; CalFresh application efforts and provides farm-fresh food to our non-transactional cafe and choice based pantries. Second, UCSC is one of the top fundraisers for their Holiday Food &amp; Fund Drive. It is my intent that our community's efforts to support them are only going to grow over the next couple of years. I hope you join me in supporting SHFB, as they support the UCSC community and the larger Santa Cruz County."</em></p>
<p><strong>One of the main recipients of food on our campus is the Basic Needs program. Kednel Jean is the director of that program and had this to say about their partnership with SHFB&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Second Harvest Food Bank has been an essential partner to UCSC's Basic Need Programs and efforts. They have partnered with our food pantries on campus and have helped us provide food to UCSC students. They have also worked with the Dean of Students Office students with Calfresh applications, which allows students who are eligible to purchase food for themselves and their households. Assisting SHFB will allow them to continue their work in supporting UCSC students and employees.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>John Steele led the Holiday Food &amp; Fund Drive for the past 10 years. I asked him how the food drive has changed during that time. He told me&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Over the years, the campus food drive made significant progress in its evolution from a canned-food drive to primarily a fund drive. The advantage of monetary donations is that Second Harvest Food Bank can leverage its reduced-cost purchasing power with local farmers and provide fresher meals with a greatly reduced carbon footprint. I am deeply grateful to everyone who supported us along the way. I am delighted that the Staff Advisory Board and a host of other people around the campus are stepping up to keep this remarkable effort moving forward. Fiat Slug!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Hunger doesn&#8217;t take a holiday, and 2020 is no exception. The Second Harvest Food Bank has seen a record-breaking need for food due to COVID and fires. In November alone, SHFB:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributed over 750,000 lbs of food to nearly 60,000 people.</li>
<li>Over 483,000 pounds of that food went out through non-profit partners (like UCSC). The rest was direct distribution to the community through nutrition programs and drive-through distribution.</li>
<li>On the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, they served over 2,000 drive-through cars.</li>

engineer Ali Yanik is leading a team of infectious disease experts developing a low-cost, easy-to-use platform for diagnosing viral infections in point-of-care settings</article-subhead><article-text><p>For over ten years, Ali Yanik has been working to develop novel biosensor technology to provide rapid, low-cost testing for disease diagnostics and precision medicine. Now, with a five-year, $3.7 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, he and his collaborators are poised to complete the development and validation of a prototype and begin testing it in the field for detection of dengue fever, yellow fever, and Zika virus infections.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re confident in being able to do this and get it into the field for testing,&#8221; said Yanik, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty revolutionary because this is a very simple tool, and yet it is also very sensitive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zika, dengue, and yellow fever are widespread viral diseases transmitted by mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical areas. The lack of accurate and rapid field diagnosis is a serious obstacle to controlling these diseases in areas where they are endemic. Sophisticated laboratory tests based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method can diagnose active infections, but these tests are not readily available in developing countries. As a result, many cases are discovered late, allowing uncontrolled transmission and massive outbreaks.</p>
<p>Yanik&#8217;s novel diagnostic platform uses nanotechnology, building on his earlier biosensor research using arrays of tiny &#8220;nanoholes&#8221; (about 200 nanometers in diameter) in a metallic membrane. Most recently, his research group added several other innovations to achieve high sensitivity with a simple, rapid test called the &#8220;ultra<strong>S</strong>ensitive <strong>P</strong>CR-fr<strong>ee</strong> <strong>D</strong>etection (SPeeD)&#8221; assay. Whereas PCR detects viral genetic material (RNA), the SPeeD assay detects viral proteins (the antigens which trigger an immune response in the body).</p>
<p>The gold-standard technique for protein detection, called ELISA, is a complex laboratory assay and, like PCR, is not readily available in developing countries. In preliminary experiments with serum samples, Yanik&#8217;s team found that their SPeeD assay was at least 10,000 times more sensitive than the most advanced ELISA tests in detecting viral proteins. The SPeeD assay also has high specificity, reliably detecting dengue virus proteins within a much higher background of Zika virus proteins.</p>
<p>Yanik&#8217;s collaborators include infectious disease specialists at Stanford University School of Medicine and at St. George&#8217;s University in Grenada. Benjamin Pinsky is medical director of the Clinical Virology Laboratory for Stanford Health Care and has ongoing research projects in Grenada; Desiree LaBeaud is a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Stanford who has been studying insect-borne viral diseases in Kenya and Grenada; and Calum Macpherson is an epidemiologist and dean of graduate studies at St. George&#8217;s University and director of the Windward Islands Research and Education Foundation (WINDREF).</p>
<p>The project will take advantage of established disease surveillance programs in Grenada, where field testing will be conducted. Yanik said the researchers plan to spend the first three years of the grant period focusing on technology development and validation, using serum samples from disease surveillance programs in Kenya for testing and comparison with PCR results. Then they will begin testing the prototype in Grenada, first in a hospital setting and later in field clinics.</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t be using it to make clinical decisions during the trials, but will run it in parallel with more complex, clinically-approved tests to see if the results match,&#8221; Yanik explained.</p>
<p>The system will be designed to provide diagnostic results within less than 35 minutes using blood samples of less than 100 microliters, at a cost of $2 per test.</p>
<p>The SPeeD assay technology overcomes a fundamental problem for biosensors known as the mass transport limit, which refers to the difficulty of getting the target molecules in a sample to the sensor surface efficiently. Yanik&#8217;s team integrated an optical sensor with lab-on-a-chip technology to create a novel, compact platform that can rapidly process samples to detect protein targets with extremely high sensitivity. The assay provides quantitative results enabling clinicians to determine the viral load in a sample without resorting to enzymatic amplification schemes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no simple, point-of-care viral load tests available in the developing world,&#8221; Yanik said. &#8220;There are low-cost assays for antibodies, but those don&#8217;t identify active infections, and because these diseases are common in the areas where they are endemic, many people have antibodies from past infections. An antibody test won&#8217;t tell you which disease is causing a patient&#8217;s symptoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Viral antigens are harder to detect than antibodies because they are present at much lower concentrations. The SPeeD assay is so sensitive, however, it can detect as few as five to 10 viral particles in a 100-microliter sample, Yanik said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Usually, there is a trade-off between sensitivity and simplicity, but we&#8217;ve shown you can achieve both,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ultimately, this platform can be used for all kinds of disease diagnostics, including detection of other viruses such as Ebola and coronavirus, as well as early detection of cancer biomarkers.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="68cefa5d807270172c1b96bd73185685"><name>community-commitments</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz continues to meet,  exceed community commitments</title><summary>The campus continues to make advancements in the areas of housing, transportation, and water conservation.</summary><start-date>1608019200000</start-date><display-name>Community commitments </display-name><path>/2020/12/community-commitments</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/12/community-commitments</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1608076163648</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1608092657134</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/12/images/bikes-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/12/images/bikes-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bikes-500px.jpg</name><display-name>bikes-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>282970</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/12/images/45d5a36a-2e7e-476b-87d2-06e3c4192b53.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2020/12/images/45d5a36a-2e7e-476b-87d2-06e3c4192b53.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>45d5a36a-2e7e-476b-87d2-06e3c4192b53.jpeg</name><display-name>45d5a36a-2e7e-476b-87d2-06e3c4192b53.jpeg</display-name><file-size>9767</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>The campus continues to make advancements in the areas of housing, transportation, and water conservation</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz has achieved or exceeded ambitious goals connected to student housing, transportation, and water conservation, according to an end-of-year analysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz is proud of its track record providing a world-class education to students and conducting transformative research in the interest of society, while also working to be a good neighbor,&#8221; Sarah Latham, Vice Chancellor, Business and Administrative Services said. &#8220;Our staff, faculty, and students are part of the community and we all want to ensure it continues to be a wonderful place to live.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded with values rooted in environmental stewardship and social justice, UC Santa Cruz staff and faculty work every day to fulfill the university&#8217;s mission to educate California&#8217;s students while minimizing the university&#8217;s carbon footprint, carefully stewarding water use, and developing solutions to address the impacts of the local housing crisis on its students, faculty and staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it thoughtfully plans for its next 20 years, the campus is committed to sustainable planning and setting&#8212;and achieving&#8212;ambitious environmental goals, all while providing a transformative experience for an increasingly diverse student body.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic required UC Santa Cruz to shift to remote instruction in March 2020 and students were encouraged to return to their permanent residences.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The response to the pandemic&#8212;which focused on mitigating spread of the virus&#8212;resulted in depopulation of the campus. Still, even when the year&#8217;s pandemic-driven measures are excluded, recent and historic data shows the campus living up to its promises:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UC Santa Cruz continues to increase on-campus housing options</strong><span>. Prior to the pandemic, the campus provided 9,401 beds for its students&#8212;10 percent above what is currently required&#8212;and is working to increase campus housing for its current student population. The campus is in the midst of renovating and renewing Kresge College, a project that will create more housing options, create a new 600-seat classroom, and provide more student support space. Kresge will be able to house up to 550 current students, about 180 more students than before the renewal.</span></li>
<li><strong>The campus community continues to increase usage of alternative transportation. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Six out of 10 people get to campus by alternative transportation, including biking, walking, transit, carpooling, and vanpools. Average daily trips to campus for the past decade have generally been 24 percent less than the 28,700 threshold identified in the target. The campus continues to develop and support programs that advance alternative transportation, including </span><a href="http://bikelibrary.weebly.com/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launching a bike library for students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></strong></li>
<li><strong>Water continues to be carefully managed and conserved. </strong><span>UC Santa Cruz used 162.7 million gallons in 2019, far below the baseline usage of 206 million gallons in the target.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Darren Thompson (Crown &#8217;95, biochemistry and molecular biology) was a gifted young chemist living and working in San Francisco when, on May 15, 1998, his life reversed course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a Friday and Thompson, who suffered from depression, was overcome by feelings of hopelessness. He decided to kill himself by swallowing cyanide. He survived but the chemical left him brain-damaged, unable to walk or talk.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Thompson, who earned his Ph.D. in chemistry from UC Santa Cruz, still suffers from some of the aftereffects of his suicide attempt. But thanks to his determination, his Christian faith, and a UC Santa Cruz professor, Thompson, 47, now runs his own consulting business and is mentoring budding young chemists at the University of Idaho, Coeur d&#8217;Alene.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a role that brings him happiness and purpose&#8212;a life different than the one he had 23 years before.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Thompson, he practically grew up on the UC Santa Cruz campus. His mother was an administrative assistant for J. Herman Blake, founding provost of Oakes College, and he spent hours playing in the fields and forests of the campus with Blake&#8217;s son, Sidney.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1991, he came to the university as an undergrad, expecting to study physics but turned toward chemistry instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I liked the reproducibility of chemistry. You could do a controlled experiment and get the same result,&#8221; said Thompson. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s Santa Cruz or Barcelona, Spain, or the moon. The results should be the same.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a sophomore, he took a Chemistry 5 class from Distinguished Professor of Chemistry Glenn Millhauser.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Darren was a standout student,&#8221; Millhauser said by phone from his office on the UC Santa Cruz campus. &#8220;He was super sharp, super engaged, but he always had a bit of an edge if he thought people were not keeping up intellectually.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thompson put it more succinctly: &#8220;Basically, I was a smart-ass.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Millhauser saw the young Thompson had &#8220;a real gift&#8221; for chemistry and invited him to work in his lab.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Thompson graduated from UC Santa Cruz, he got a job at a commercial research lab in San Francisco. He also played guitar in a shoegazer-style band named Faded, doing gigs around the Bay Area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the outside, Thompson appeared confident, successful. Inside, however, he said he raged at the hopelessness of life.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thompson said he&#8217;d watched James Bond movies where someone swallowed a cyanide pill, had a few convulsions, foamed at the mouth, and then died. Instead, he said, after he swallowed what he believed to be a lethal dose of cyanide, his head filled with excruciating pain as the chemical caused his brain to swell. He suffered for two hours before calling an ambulance. He was 24.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thompson was put in a medically induced coma for three weeks. He lost the ability to speak and walk. A photo from the time showed his hands curled into fists, his legs thin and weak. Millhauser&#8217;s voice cracked with emotion when he recalled seeing Thompson in the hospital hooked to tubes and beeping monitors.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five months later, Thompson was released from the hospital and returned to his mother and stepfather&#8217;s home in Santa Cruz County. He weighed 130 pounds. He needed a wheelchair to get around. His speech was slow and stunted.&#160; But his cognition was intact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millhauser, thinking it would be good for Thompson to be stimulated intellectually, invited his former student to attend the lab&#8217;s weekly meetings.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It has always been the culture of my lab that anyone who is serious can be part of the team,&#8221; Millhauser explained. &#8220;We welcome them and help them develop skills so they can be successful young scientists.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Week after week at the meeting, Thompson said nothing. Then, one day, he spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, Millhauser paired Thompson with another researcher and the pair got to work in the lab. Graduating from a wheelchair to a walker to a cane, Thompson was encouraged by Millhauser to pursue his Ph.D. In 2009, Thompson walked across a stage under his own power where Millhauser settled a doctoral stole on his shoulders.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was a pretty exciting day for me,&#8221; said Thompson, who also won a prestigious ARCS Foundation fellowship while at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One the phone, Thompson used precise, scientific terms to explain how the cyanide acted on his body. But he also was funny and self-deprecating. His slow and slightly slurred speech, he said, was like having &#8220;all the deficits of being drunk but none of the benefits.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thompson went on to do post-doc research at Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. He has 39 published research papers to his name. But one day, he said, he went to fill up his car with gas and couldn&#8217;t remember his PIN. For a man who said he has a photographic memory, the sudden cognitive hiccup scared him. At the lab, he worked with anhydrous hydrofluoric acid, a dangerous chemical, and he worried that if his memory faltered and he did something wrong, he could accidentally release the chemical into the lab and hurt people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He left Scripps and in 2015 he moved to his parents&#8217; new home in Sandpoint, Idaho, where he formed his company, Peptidaho, a consulting company centered on his work with peptides.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Thompson wanted to do more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He approached University of Idaho, Coeur d&#8217;Alene, Director Charles Buck and Lab Coordinator John Wieser with an idea. He was given lab space and named an adjunct professor of chemistry and now volunteers in a summer program mentoring and helping a select number of students with intense research projects, passing on his love of science.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My Christian faith helped me see that I lacked humility because, as a young person, I thought life owed me something and I was entitled to have all the stuff given to me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But now I&#8217;ve come full circle. I think I owe this life something.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His work with students &#8220;builds me up and gives my life purpose and meaning,&#8221; he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research team conducted in-depth interviews with 13 mothers of nonspeaking autistic children to uncover both the conventional and unconventional ways that autistic children and their parents form strong bonds.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the hallmarks of autism is that autistic people are less likely to engage in behaviors that are traditional indicators of social interest&#8212;for example, making eye contact, responding to their name, or looking where someone points. Some people with autism also don&#8217;t communicate verbally. All of these factors can be challenges in forming social connections, but that doesn&#8217;t mean autistic people aren&#8217;t interested in relationships.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/06/akhtar-autism.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prior research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> featuring the testimonials of autistic individuals demonstrates that many people with autism have a strong desire for social connection. And it&#8217;s equally important for parents. Having a child who doesn&#8217;t seem socially connected is associated with higher levels of parenting stress. So researchers wanted to deeply examine behaviors and belief systems that may help to strengthen relationships in families.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of this study are now published in the online journal </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242661"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLoS ONE</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The research team included Janette Dinishak, an associate professor of philosophy at UC Santa Cruz; Nameera Akhtar, a professor of developmental psychology at UCSC; Vikram Jaswal, lead author of the study and associate professor of psychology at the University of Virginia; and anthropologist Christine Stephan, a collaborator with Jaswal&#8217;s lab.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team&#8217;s interdisciplinary approach allowed them to tackle big questions around autism and connection through a multifaceted lens that incorporated psychological, ethical, and cultural context. In particular, they wanted to challenge the popular &#8220;deficit view&#8221; of autism that describes the condition in terms of impairments relative to neurotypical development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The dominant perspective on autism for decades has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">conceptualized </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">autistic experience and capacity </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">just the absence of what &#8216;normal people&#8217; have,&#8221; explained UCSC </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">associate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">professor of philosophy Janette Dinishak. &#8220;That&#8217;s dehumanizing in itself, but we also have to appreciate how little </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> come to understand about a person if </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just see them as the absence of something else.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC psychology professor Nameera Akhtar added that the key to flipping the script is to &#8220;see the person that&#8217;s there,&#8221; which mothers in the study demonstrated in a variety of ways. One of the major trends identified in the research was that mothers attributed rich personalities to their nonspeaking autistic children, providing a crucial lens through which to interpret their behavior.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mothers also expressed that less frequent occurrences of traditional connection behaviors&#8212;like eye contact, speech, or physical contact&#8212;made it feel all the more meaningful when those behaviors did happen. And mothers became more attuned to other ways of connecting, like shared experiences, physical proximity, rituals, and providing special care to meet their children&#8217;s needs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mothers' belief that their children have a desire to connect with them can even lead them to interpret their children&#8217;s behaviors in ways that support relationship building. While mothers in the study ascribed personal meaning to behaviors that had a positive impact on the relationship, they often reframed challenging behaviors as attributable to factors outside of the relationship, like difficulty with impulse control and self-regulation, anxiety, pain, or overstimulation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One important message from our research is that our ability to feel connected to someone depends on our interpretation of their behavior, rather than the behavior itself,&#8221; said the study&#8217;s lead author, Vikram Jaswal.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mothers in the study also discussed the importance of assuming competence on the part of their children. For example, they presumed that their children understood what was said to them. This belief helps parents perceive their children&#8217;s subsequent behavior as meaningful, which may have key developmental implications.&#160;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797616647520"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has examined the role of developmental cascades and social feedback loops in autism, which Akhtar describes as being like &#8220;a self-fulfilling prophecy.&#8221; If parents aren&#8217;t noticing or responding to behaviors that may be attempts at establishing connection, that could hinder children in developing social competencies. On the other hand, If parents respond positively, it may encourage future connection efforts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, mothers in the study expressed how crucial it was to arrive at an acceptance of autism that allowed them to focus more on building a strong relationship with their child, rather than trying to change them. The stigmas associated with an autism diagnosis can sometimes obscure this perspective, but the research team hopes the insights from mothers captured within their study may help other families navigate their own paths to building stronger bonds with their children.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="775c6645807270172c1b96bdb1ae2c28"><name>upcoming-maintenance-impacting-campus-network</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Upcoming Maintenance Impacting Campus Network - 12/22&amp;23 and 12/30</title><summary>Wireless, campus phones and wired connections will be impacted in certain areas throughout campus, but no one outage should last longer than one hour. </summary><start-date>1608278400000</start-date><display-name>Upcoming Maintenance Impacting Campus Network - 12/22&amp;23 and 12/30</display-name><path>/2020/12/upcoming-maintenance-impacting-campus-network</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/12/upcoming-maintenance-impacting-campus-network</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1608320312871</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1608320312871</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span>The&#160;following work by ITS will impact wireless, wired, and campus telephone connections.

The first case was reported on December 5, and the most recent was reported on December 12. Since then, there have been no additional positive cases. This is considered a workplace outbreak as defined by Cal/OSHA, although the cases do not appear to be work-related. Through the contact tracing process, these COVID-19 cases were determined to be caused by off-campus community exposure.<br/><br/>We do not believe that those using Colleges Nine and Ten Dining to obtain meals were in close contact with the staff members who tested positive for COVID-19, based on the information we have and because of the practices used at campus facilities to help reduce the spread of COVID-19.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical education courses are funded entirely through student-approved measures that require the department to steward those resources by maximizing programming and complying with the intent of those measures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Physical education courses are an important part of the transformative experience,&#8221; said Sue Harriman, director of the Athletics and Recreation Department. &#8220;We are focused on serving our students and ensuring that their fees are offering them the best possible experiential opportunities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz Athletics and Recreation Department is committed to offering programs and activities that promote leadership, lifelong wellness, and experiential learning. Harriman said the restructuring and operational changes will not impact the quality of its courses. Additionally, students will not have fewer available PE classes&#8212;there will be a greater variety of courses and more sessions of the most popular ones.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department will continue to offer PE courses in scuba, aikido, dance, and many other areas, and is looking to begin offering new courses, such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction to Racquet Sports</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which students learn how to play 5 racquet sports,&#8221; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officiating 101</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an introduction to serving as a campus or community referee, official, or umpire; and more</span><strong>. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department will also no longer offer courses that have had continued low or no enrollment over the past five years.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning in fall 2021, UC Santa Cruz will hire most physical education instructors through by-agreement appointments, which outline their duties and the campus's expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This requires some staff positions to change to per-course positions, which is a more sustainable model that will help support the long-term health of Athletics and Recreation. Though the hiring process is changing, Harriman said instructors will need to have a proven track record in teaching and hold all the required certifications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The operational changes will enable the department to expand the ways that it serves students and continue investing in its facilities.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past several years, the campus has invested in the dance studio, including resurfacing the floor, and plans to continue using this facility for dance instruction, Harriman said, addressing unfounded concerns that there were plans to install astroturf in the dance studio.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department is also recommending several P.E. courses qualify for academic credit and expects all P.E. courses are taught with clearly defined learning outcomes with a syllabus that outlines the progressive nature of the curriculum and demonstrates learned skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To maximize existing funding and the positive impact on students, the department is reducing duplication between P.E. courses, Fitness programming, and Adventure Recreation, and trying to minimize any additional out-of-pocket costs for students. There will be a limited number of times P.E. courses can be repeated by students so that there&#8217;s broader access to students who have not been able to participate in popular courses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harriman said educational and recreational equity underpins this decision. The department wants to make sure all students can participate in recreational or athletic activities, regardless of their financial situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For many students, this will represent their first opportunity to engage in athletic related activities that support their well-being at UCSC,&#8221; Harriman said. &#8220;The goal is to promote physical activity, encourage health and wellness, and build community. This program is a great opportunity for students to build networks, friendships, and sense of belonging through participating in extracurricular activities on campus.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The swimming pool is expected to re-open in early 2021 and the tennis courts on the westside of campus will reopen once some maintenance is completed, Harriman said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department is also making preparations to begin offering outdoor group exercise classes, boating, surfing, kayaking, and day hikes on the campus. Physical education courses will resume once the campus returns to in-person instruction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While UC Santa Cruz has not made any announcements about fall 2021, Harriman said the department is planning to begin offering in-person classes, so long as it&#8217;s possible under public health guidance. Scuba is among the courses planned for fall, along with more introductory swim courses throughout the&#160; 2021-22 academic calendar.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We may not be able to implement too much this summer due to the pandemic but that just gives us more time to plan and consult with the students on what they want,&#8221; Harriman said. &#8220;Athletics and Recreation plans to come back after the New Year to survey the students in our new campaign #MoreSlugs2021. We are here to serve students.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="880774bc807270172c1b96bd6ca843f1"><name>scipp-director</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Steven Ritz stepping down after 10 years as director of particle physics institute</title><summary>Jason Nielsen, professor of physics, will take over as director of the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) in the new year.</summary><start-date>1608537600000</start-date><display-name>Steven Ritz stepping down after 10 years as director of particle physics institute</display-name><path>/2020/12/scipp-director</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/12/scipp-director</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1608599958677</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1610130164271</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Appointments</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/12/images/steve-ritz-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/12/images/steve-ritz-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>steve-ritz-350.jpg</name><display-name>steve-ritz-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>54223</file-size><width>350</width><height>344</height></image><image-alt>Steve Ritz</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/12/images/steve-ritz-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/12/images/steve-ritz-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>steve-ritz-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>steve-ritz-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17136</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Steve Ritz</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Steven Ritz at the site of the Vera C.

Physics Professor Jason Nielsen, who has served as associate director of SCIPP for the past eight years, will replace Ritz as director starting January 1, 2021. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Now is an excellent time to do it. It&#8217;s been ten years, SCIPP is very strong, and Jason has been great as associate director, so this was an easy decision,&#8221; Ritz said. &#8220;</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">I want to have more time to do</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> physics, </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">interact with students, and</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">expand efforts</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> related to diversity, equity, and inclusion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Established in 1980, SCIPP is an interdisciplinary research unit focusing on experimental, theoretical, and computational aspects of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. SCIPP scientists, including faculty in the Departments of Physics and Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, play leading roles in experimental, </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">observational,</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> and theoretical research in these areas. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Ritz is currently serving as project scientist for the Rubin Observatory LSST Camera, which will be the largest digital camera ever constructed, with more than 3 billion pixels of solid-state detectors. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, now under construction in Chile, will conduct the 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), collecting vast amounts of data to address major scientific questions in astronomy, cosmology, </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">and particle physics</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Ritz has also been very active in NASA&#8217;s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, a highly successful project that involved SCIPP in many aspects of its design, development, and research. Ritz served in a variety of roles in the Fermi mission, including project scientist. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Other major astrophysics projects involving SCIPP scientists include </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">the gamma-ray observatories</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> VERITAS </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">and CTA</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), both of which are large international collaborations in optical astronomy.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">That&#8217;s been a big change for SCIPP, g</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">row</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">ing from gamma rays to optical </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">surveys</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, using different techniques and different ways of addressing scientifically interesting questions in astrophysics, cosmology, </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">and particle physics</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">. I&#8217;m very happy about that transition,&#8221; Ritz said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">SCIPP also continues to play a major role in the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Switzerland, where scientists </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">famously</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> confirmed the existence of the Higgs boson in 2012. UCSC physicists have been at the forefront of U.S. participation in the LHC and the ATLAS collaboration, making important theoretical and experimental contributions to the largest ongoing project in particle physics worldwide. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">SCIPP is recognized as a world leader in the development of custom electronics and silicon sensors for state-of-the-art particle detection systems, and SCIPP physicists have been working on ATLAS, the larger of two general purpose detectors at the LHC, since 1994.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Nielsen has been deeply involved in the ATLAS project and currently serves on the management advisory committee for the U.S. ATLAS organization. His research focuses on the physics of the Higgs boson, and his group is currently involved in precision measurements of its interactions with other particles. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Meanwhile, SCIPP is gearing up for a major upgrade of the ATLAS experiment that will be installed around 2025. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">We&#8217;re calling it an upgrade, but some parts are being replaced completely, so our clean room at SCIPP is buzzing now as we prepare to enter the production phase for the silicon detectors,&#8221; Nielsen said. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking forward to all the opportunities for doing </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">great</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> science in the future, with new experiments coming online not only in collider physics, but also in astrophysics and the large survey projects we&#8217;re involved in.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">SCIPP has long had a reputation in the physics community for innovative science and a collaborative atmosphere. Ritz credits founding director Abe Seiden for building a strong culture of collaboration at SCIPP, which he has sought to maintain. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Nielsen said he was grateful to Ritz and Seiden for their mentorship, adding, &#8220;They set the stage for the way people collaborate and the way SCIPP is seen internationally, so we&#8217;re able to attract </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">outstanding</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> people who want to work in this kind of environment.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cf2d055c807270172c1b96bdf86ead31"><name>giving-tuesday-follow</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Giving Tuesday: A day of generosity </title><summary>Giving Tuesday exemplified the generosity that Banana Slugs displayed in 2020.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout 2020, the Banana Slug community stepped up to support the campus in one of its most difficult years, marked by a pandemic, distance learning, and an evacuation during the devastating CZU August Lightning Complex fires.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz community showed that spirit this fall when it </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/10/giving-day-2020-feature.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised more than $600,000 on Giving Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a high-octane, 24-hour online festival of giving. And this generosity came through once again on December 1 during UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s </span><a href="https://givingtuesday.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving Tuesday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which raised an additional $18,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With COVID-19 recovery efforts, wildfire relief, and our annual Giving Day, we are overwhelmed by the continued generosity of our donors,&#8221; said Emily Denning-Todd, associate director of annual and digital giving. &#8220;And once again ... our donors showed up to support our students on Giving Tuesday.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving Tuesday was a simple, straightforward campaign that raised money for the UC Santa Cruz Fund, a flexible fund that allows campus leadership to address</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> UC Santa Cruz students&#8217; most pressing needs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Giving Tuesday is not an extension of Giving Day. It&#8217;s the campus&#8217;s way of taking part in a &#8220;global generosity movement&#8221; that was founded eight years ago to increase international goodwill and collaboration, and inspire good works.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving Tuesday is held annually the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, with countries around the world participating.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="68d9ee9a807270172c1b96bd28af7143"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2020/12/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/12/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1612371848840</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1612371848840</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="68d9ee9a807270172c1b96bd28af7143"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2020/12/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/12/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1612371848840</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1612371848840</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
