<p>Litz&#8217;s research addresses the unique challenges of data center systems. The amount of data that needs to be stored and processed is growing at a staggering pace, while technologies that have enabled exponential increases in system performance in the past are now reaching their limits. As a result, there is a widening gap between supply and demand for storage capabilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;System developers can no longer rely on the continued exponential improvements delivered by silicon technology,&#8221; said Litz, who is associate director of the <a href="https://www.crss.ucsc.edu/index.html">Center for Research in Storage Systems</a> (CRSS) in the <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a>. &#8220;We need new holistic approaches that optimize systems across the entire hardware and software stack to enable the continued growth of storage system capabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>New storage technologies, such as flash and other types of non-volatile memory, can offer some improvements in performance, but they have unique properties that require a redesign of existing system architectures. &#8220;Storage technology is still advancing, but it is becoming more heterogeneous. Things are getting more complex, and we have to adjust the systems to accommodate that,&#8221; Litz said.</p>
<p>Litz proposes a combination of techniques to address these challenges, including cross-layer optimizations to improve the efficiency of storage systems and make the best use of available resources. A critical element of the project is the use of machine learning techniques to optimize systems for a given application.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can use machine learning to make storage systems more efficient,&#8221; Litz said.</p>
<p>His approach aims to optimize storage systems across all layers of the &#8220;system stack,&#8221; including the hardware architecture, operating system design, data center computing, and applications. Instead of completely redesigning the software stack that has been developed over years, he wants to, in effect, &#8220;poke holes&#8221; through it to observe and control the underlying systems. Machine learning tools can then be used to increase the flexibility of the system and achieve greater efficiencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;These systems use optimization algorithms for things like resource allocation, and machine learning can enable us to modify those algorithms based on what a specific application needs,&#8221; Litz said. &#8220;It creates more flexibility and gives us the opportunity of fine-tuning systems to the applications.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of this effort, Litz is collaborating with researchers in the data storage industry, including Samsung, Western Digital, and Broadcom. He noted that his experience as a visiting researcher at Google exposed him to the industry&#8217;s most challenging and important problems.</p>
<p>Litz is also incorporating aspects of his research into the curriculum at the Baskin School of Engineering, adding machine learning elements to courses on computer systems and architecture. He said he has noticed a lot of interest in machine learning among female engineering students and hopes to use this to increase the diversity of the systems research field.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to encourage more women to go into this field, and bringing machine learning into it may help with that,&#8221; Litz said. He is involved in a variety of education and outreach initiatives with UCSC&#8217;s Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning (CITL), Women in Science and Engineering (WISE), and local public schools.</p>
<p>Litz received his Ph.D. from Mannheim University in Germany and did postdoctoral research at Stanford University. He joined the UCSC faculty in 2017.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9c9f6fdc80727017465cacce9ce59bb0"><name>holl-primer</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Karen Holl publishes a "primer" on ecological restoration</title><summary>Karen Holl has introduced hundreds of undergraduates to ecological restoration, and now she has published the book she wishes had been available when she first stepped into the classroom. </summary><keywords>ecology, restoration</keywords><start-date>1583222400000</start-date><display-name>Holl-Primer</display-name><path>/2020/03/holl-primer</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/03/holl-primer</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1583175659330</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1583260704350</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/03/images/holl-cover_350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/03/images/holl-cover_350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>holl-cover_350.jpg</name><display-name>holl-cover_350.jpg</display-name><file-size>57431</file-size><width>350</width><height>524</height></image><image-alt>Cover of Holl's book</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/03/images/holl-cover_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/03/images/holl-cover_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>holl-cover_80.jpg</name><display-name>holl-cover_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>3124</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Cover of Holl's book</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/03/images/holl_350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/03/images/holl_350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>holl_350.jpg</name><display-name>holl_350.jpg</display-name><file-size>38722</file-size><width>350</width><height>383</height></image><image-alt>Head shot of Karen Holl</image-alt><image-caption><p>"I've been talking about writing this book for 25 years," said Karen Holl.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Over the years, Environmental Studies Professor Karen Holl has introduced hundreds of undergraduates to ecological restoration and inspired a significant number to pursue a career in environmental management.</p>
<p>With graduates working in top governmental agencies and universities, as well as state parks, nonprofits, and private firms, Holl is gratified by the impact of her teaching.</p>
<p>Now, after 24 years of teaching "Restoration Ecology," Holl has published the book she wishes had been available for her when she first stepped into the classroom. At just 200 pages, <a href="https://islandpress.org/primer-ecological-restoration"><em>Primer of Ecological Restoration</em></a> covers how to plan, develop, implement, and monitor restoration projects, with chapters on hydrology, soil, invasive species, revegetation, fauna, legislation, and funding.</p>
<p>Holl was determined to keep the cost of the book&#8212;$35&#8212;down, so she eschewed color photographs in favor of diagrams and tables; photos, links to videos, and additional downloadable resources, including <a href="https://islandpress.org/case-studies">case studies</a> that accompany the text, are available on the <a href="https://islandpress.org/primer-ecological-restoration">website</a> maintained by publisher Island Press.</p>
<p>"I've been talking about writing this book for 25 years," said Holl. "It's a succinct but broad overview, and I made it as international as possible."</p>
<p>Written primarily for students, instructors, and practitioners, the primer presents the "big picture" of restoration concepts and practices and serves as a foundation for further learning. Among the case studies are the Sacramento River, the Galapagos tortoise, and, closer to home, Younger Lagoon, which is part of the UC Natural Reserves System and a spot where many of Holl's undergraduate interns have gotten hands-on experience doing restoration. Holl also provides reading lists at the end of each chapter for those seeking more information.</p>
<p>Holl, an ecologist whose own expertise is in restoring tropical forest and California grasslands, consulted with political scientists, economists, and resource managers&#8212;including some former students&#8212;to make sure the book's content is comprehensive and relevant. When she had a draft ready for the publisher last year, she "field tested" it in her class.</p>
<p>"Restoration is an interdisciplinary endeavor," said Holl. "You need to know the ecology and natural history of an ecosystem, and what methods are appropriate, but it's also really important to engage stakeholders throughout the process. You need to set realistic goals, know the permitting process and how to get funds, and projects need to be monitored."</p>
<p>Holl supports restoration projects as an adviser and has worked closely on tropical rainforest restoration in several Latin American countries. Her goal is to see the book translated into Spanish and Portuguese.</p>
<p>"I want to bridge the divide between academics and management communities," she said. "Scientific research needs to be shaped to support and improve on-the-ground restoration projects."</p>
<p>Looking ahead, restoration ecologists must wrangle with the question of whether the goal is to restore ecosystems to their "historic condition" or for a future marked by climate change. Other challenges include how to "scale up" restoration projects from "postage stamp" pilot projects to sizable acreage, how to balance tradeoffs when the human and ecological benefits of certain restoration strategies don't align, and how to develop creative strategies to pay for restoration.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of different ways to pay for restoration," said Holl, who mentioned local, state, and federal government funds; legislation requiring people who do damage to pay for mitigation; and private foundations.</p>
<p>Holl, who dedicates her book to her son and her students "with hopes for a more sustainable future," keeps in touch with dozens of former students, and she takes great pride in their success, inviting some back as guest lecturers in her classes.</p>
<p>"My former students are working in natural resource management positions all over the place&#8212;government, conservation organizations, public and private agencies and NGOs. Some own their own firms."</p>
<p>Helping build society's capacity to cope with the negative impacts humans have had on the natural world gives her some hope, she said. But she is quick to sound a cautionary note: "Restoration is not a substitute for conserving intact ecosystems or reducing greenhouse gas emissions," she said. "It is one piece of the puzzle, but we can't plant our way out of climate change."</p>

The session will now be live-video format only, not in-person sessions. Campus is also extending the scoping period to provide alternative methods for public participation.&#160;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is preparing the Environmental Impact Report for its proposed Long Range Development Plan in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act. The proposed LRDP would replace the 2005 LRDP for campus, and proposes land uses to support the academic mission of UC Santa Cruz through 2040.</p>
<h3 id="scopingsessions">Scoping sessions</h3>
<p>The scoping sessions give the public the opportunity to learn more about the environmental review process for the LRDP. Those who participate in the scoping sessions are able to provide comments on the range of issues to be addressed in the EIR. Note that the date and times for the sessions remain the same despite the change to a virtual format. Here are the details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Campus Scoping Session: Thursday, March 12, noon to 2 p.m.</li>
<li>Community Scoping Session: Thursday, March 12, 6&#8211;8 p.m.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://video.ibm.com/channel/WfRRwzKR4We">Use this link to participate in either session</a>.</p>
<p>During each session, planners will give a brief presentation, then read the public comments they have received to date via the live video feed. The presentation will be posted on <a href="https://lrdp.ucsc.edu">the LRDP website</a> before the event; the link to the live video feed will also be included online.</p>
<p>If you would like your comments to be read during the live feed, send them to <a href="mailto:eircomment@ucsc.edu">eircomment@ucsc.edu</a> from now until the end of each scoping session. Please indicate which session, &#8220;Campus&#8221; or &#8220;Community,&#8221; you would like your comments to be read aloud during, and provide your full name for the transcript. All comments received will be included in the record. Depending on the volume of comments received, and as is typical with all public hearings, we may limit each person&#8217;s comment to three minutes to make sure all comments are heard.&#160;</p>
<h3 id="additionalscopingsession&#160;">Additional scoping session&#160;</h3>
<p>An additional scoping session will be added the first week of April. We anticipate this will also be a virtual session. More details will be provided in the coming week.&#160;</p>
<h3 id="scopingperiod&#160;">Scoping period&#160;</h3>
<p>Campus is extending the deadline of the scoping period from 5 p.m. Monday, March 30, to 5 p.m. Wednesday, April 8.&#160;</p>
<p>Written comments will be accepted anytime during the Notice of Preparation review period, which runs from now until 5 p.m. Wednesday, April 8. Please state &#8220;LRDP NOP Comments&#8221; in the subject line, and send your written or electronic responses, with appropriate contact information, to the following address:</p>

<p>Their results, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab700c">published March 10 in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em></a>, provide the first conclusive association between the diffuse gas in the space between galaxies and the large-scale structure of the cosmic web predicted by cosmological theory.</p>
<p>According to the prevailing theory, as the universe evolved after the big bang, matter became distributed in a web-like network of interconnected filaments separated by huge voids. Luminous galaxies full of stars and planets formed at the intersections and densest regions of the filaments where matter is most concentrated. The filaments of diffuse hydrogen gas extending between the galaxies are largely invisible, although astronomers have managed to glimpse parts of them.</p>
<p>None of which seems to have anything to do with a lowly slime mold called <em>Physarum polycephalum</em>, typically found growing on decaying logs and leaf litter on the forest floor and sometimes forming spongy yellow masses on lawns. But <em>Physarum</em> has a long history of surprising scientists with its ability to create optimal distribution networks and solve computationally difficult spatial organization problems. In one famous experiment, a slime mold replicated the layout of Japan&#8217;s rail system by connecting food sources arranged to represent the cities around Tokyo.</p>
<p><strong>Slime mold algorithm</strong></p>
<p>Joe Burchett, a postdoctoral researcher in astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, had been looking for a way to visualize the cosmic web on a large scale, but he was skeptical when Oskar Elek, a postdoctoral researcher in computational media, suggested using a <em>Physarum</em>-based algorithm. After all, completely different forces shape the cosmic web and the growth of a slime mold.</p>
<p>But Elek, who has always been fascinated by patterns in nature, had been impressed by the <em>Physarum</em> &#8220;biofabrications&#8221; of Berlin-based artist <a href="https://sagejenson.com/">Sage Jenson</a>. Starting with the 2-dimensional <em>Physarum</em> model Jenson used (originally <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/artl.2010.16.2.16202">developed in 2010 by Jeff Jones</a>), Elek and a friend (programmer Jan Ivanecky) extended it to three dimensions and made additional modifications to create a new algorithm they called the Monte Carlo Physarum Machine.</p>
<p>Burchett gave Elek a dataset of 37,000 galaxies from the <a href="https://www.sdss.org/">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a> (SDSS), and when they applied the new algorithm to it, the result was a pretty convincing representation of the cosmic web.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was kind of a Eureka moment, and I became convinced that the slime mold model was the way forward for us,&#8221; Burchett said. &#8220;It&#8217;s somewhat coincidental that it works, but not entirely. A slime mold creates an optimized transport network, finding the most efficient pathways to connect food sources. In the cosmic web, the growth of structure produces networks that are also, in a sense, optimal. The underlying processes are different, but they produce mathematical structures that are analogous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elek also noted that &#8220;the model we developed is several layers of abstraction away from its original inspiration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, a strong visual resemblance of the model results to the expected structure of the cosmic web doesn&#8217;t prove anything. The researchers performed a variety of tests to validate the model as they continued to refine it.</p>
<p><strong>Dark matter</strong></p>
<p>Until now, the best representations of the cosmic web have emerged from computer simulations of the evolution of structure in the universe, showing the distribution of dark matter on large scales, including the massive dark matter halos in which galaxies form and the filaments that connect them. Dark matter is invisible, but it makes up about 85 percent of the matter in the universe, and gravity causes ordinary matter to follow the distribution of dark matter.</p>
<p>Burchett&#8217;s team used data from the Bolshoi-Planck cosmological simulation&#8212;developed by Joel Primack, professor emeritus of physics at UC Santa Cruz, and others&#8212;to test the Monte Carlo Physarum Machine. After extracting a catalog of dark matter halos from the simulation, they ran the algorithm to reconstruct the web of filaments connecting them. When they compared the outcome of the algorithm to the original simulation, they found a tight correlation. The slime mold model essentially replicated the web of filaments in the dark matter simulation, and the researchers were able to use the simulation to fine-tune the parameters of their model.</p>
<p>&#8220;Starting with 450,000 dark matter halos, we can get an almost perfect fit to the density fields in the cosmological simulation,&#8221; Elek said.</p>
<p>Burchett also performed what he called a &#8220;sanity check,&#8221; comparing the observed properties of the SDSS galaxies with the gas densities in the intergalactic medium predicted by the slime mold model. Star formation activity in a galaxy should correlate with the density of its galactic environment, and Burchett was relieved to see the expected correlations.</p>
<p>Now the team had a predicted structure for the cosmic web connecting the 37,000 SDSS galaxies, which they could test against astronomical observations. For this, they used data from the Hubble Space Telescope&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/hubble-space-telescope-cosmic-origins-spectrograph">Cosmic Origins Spectrograph</a>. Intergalactic gas leaves a distinctive absorption signature in the spectrum of light that passes through it, and the sight-lines of hundreds of distant quasars pierce the volume of space occupied by the SDSS galaxies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew where the filaments of the cosmic web should be thanks to the slime mold, so we could go to the archived Hubble spectra for the quasars that probe that space and look for the signatures of the gas,&#8221; Burchett explained. &#8220;Wherever we saw a filament in our model, the Hubble spectra showed a gas signal, and the signal got stronger toward the middle of filaments where the gas should be denser.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the densest regions, however, the signal dropped off. This too matched expectations, he said, because heating of the gas in those regions ionizes the hydrogen, stripping off electrons and eliminating the absorption signature.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first time now, we can quantify the density of the intergalactic medium from the remote outskirts of cosmic web filaments to the hot, dense interiors of galaxy clusters,&#8221; Burchett said. &#8220;These results not only confirm the structure of the cosmic web predicted by cosmological models, they also give us a way to improve our understanding of galaxy evolution by connecting it with the gas reservoirs out of which galaxies form.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Creative coding</strong></p>
<p>Burchett and Elek met through coauthor Angus Forbes, an associate professor of computational media and director of the <a href="https://creativecoding.soe.ucsc.edu/news.php">UCSC Creative Coding</a> lab in the <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a>. Burchett and Forbes had begun collaborating after meeting at an open mic night for musicians in Santa Cruz, focusing initially on a data visualization app, which they <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13705">published last year</a>.</p>
<p>Forbes also introduced Elek to the work of Sage Jenson, not because he thought it would apply to Burchett&#8217;s cosmic web project, but because &#8220;he knew I was a nature pattern freak,&#8221; Elek said.</p>
<p>Coauthor J. Xavier Prochaska, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC who has done pioneering work using quasars to probe the structure of the intergalactic medium, said, &#8220;This creative technique and its unanticipated success highlight the value of interdisciplinary collaborations, where completely different perspectives and expertise are brought to bear on scientific problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Forbes&#8217; Creative Coding lab combines approaches from media arts, design, and computer science. &#8220;I think there can be real opportunities when you integrate the arts into scientific research,&#8221; Forbes said. &#8220;Creative approaches to modeling and visualizing data can lead to new perspectives that help us make sense of complex systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Burchett, Elek, Prochaska, and Forbes, the coauthors include Nicolas Tejos at the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaiso, Chile; Todd Tripp at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst; and Rongmon Bordoloi at North Carolina State University.

One of the country&#8217;s most popular tourist destinations, it is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. <br/><br/>But a new &#8220;born-digital&#8221; publication by UC Santa Cruz associate history professor Elaine Sullivan takes a fresh look at the region to demonstrate how the site has evolved over more than 2,500 years. <br/><br/>Titled <em>Constructing the Sacred: Visibility and Ritual Landscape at the Egyptian Necropolis of Saqqara</em>&#8212;it has just been published by Stanford University Press, as part of their new series of monographs and scholarly publications.<br/><br/><strong>Sullivan&#8217;s project uses 3D</strong> technologies to enhance Geographic Information Systems (GIS)--one of the prevalent formats for data organization in modern archaeology&#8212;in order to create interactive models that can be navigated through space and time to explore the Egyptian site.<br/><br/>Her publication is among the first to push the boundaries to include interactive 3D models that can be navigated both spatially and temporally. <br/><br/>&#8220;Ancient landscapes are a major focus of study in the field of archaeology, with dozens of publications appearing annually on the interaction between humans, culture, and the natural and built environment at sites around the world,&#8221; said Sullivan. &#8220;While clearly of great interest to scholars, these past places remain elusive. The archaeological sites we visit today are <em>palimpsests</em>--the result of thousands of years of change, both architectural and environmental.&#8221; <br/><br/>Sullivan noted that due to significant modification and degradation, direct field observation of embodied past spaces is often impossible today. <br/><br/>&#8220;Building superstructures have collapsed or been remodeled, monuments have been purposefully modified or destroyed, rivers have shifted, and lakes have disappeared,&#8221; said Sullivan. &#8220;In Egypt, for example, the Nile river has shifted course, and meters of sand from the Sahara desert have covered ancient buildings. At most long-lived ancient sites, it is difficult to reimagine so many layers of change simultaneously. My born-digital monograph presents an innovative methodology for examining such landscape change at ancient sites--a view only possible to attain with the aid of new technologies.&#8221;<br/><br/><strong>Sullivan pointed out</strong> that the 3D environment in her project allows the researcher to examine the site from an explicitly human point-of-view, and to question how cultural symbolism or importance was embedded within the lived landscape. <br/><br/>&#8220;I consider myself a 'digital humanist,' a scholar that is interested in exploring the potential of digital technologies for the Humanities,&#8221; said Sullivan. &#8220;As a historian, I'm focused on understanding the human experience in the past through the examination of text, art, architecture, and other forms of material culture. But although people in the past lived in a three-dimensional world, we generally communicate our research about them in 2D. That leaves out a lot of important information.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;So a number of scholars have taken on the challenge of re-thinking aspects of the Humanities to include a richer level of information that tries to incorporate three-dimensional objects and spaces and change over time,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I'm just one of many people experimenting with new ways to use digital tools to record and communicate aspects of history.&#8221;<br/><br/>Sullivan joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 2013. Her field experience in Egypt includes five seasons of excavation with Johns Hopkins University at the temple of the goddess Mut (Luxor), as well as four seasons in the field with a UCLA project in the Egyptian Fayum, at the Greco-Roman town of Karanis.</p>
<p>She received her M.A. and Ph.D. in Egyptian art and archaeology from Johns Hopkins University, and her B.A. in history from Duke University.<br/><br/>&#8220;In my time at UCSC, I've focused on building our Digital Humanities programs,&#8221; said Sullivan. &#8220;McHenry library now has a digital scholarship commons, where students from my undergraduate classes, for example, have used virtual reality headsets to walk through an Egyptian tomb we are studying in class. In spring quarter, I am co-teaching (with Professor Zac Zimmer in Literature) UCSC's first graduate course in Digital Humanities. We want our graduate students to be engaged with these developments and ready to incorporate digital technologies into their own research, when appropriate.&#8221;<br/><br/>Sullivan will also be the UCSC faculty leader on an alumni trip to Egypt this summer through the campus&#8217;s <em>Inspired Expeditions</em> program. <br/> <br/>"I'm really excited about this opportunity because I love sharing my passion for Egypt and its incredible cultural heritage with others,&#8221; said Sullivan. &#8220;I studied abroad at the American University in Cairo when I was an undergraduate, and I've spent many months on excavations, living in Luxor and the Fayum oasis. I think Egypt is one of the most incredible places in the world.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a87ec64680727017465cacce861030bc"><name>genomics-covid19-precautions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Genomics Institute COVID-19 Precautions</title><summary>In an abundance of caution, UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute staff have been advised to telecommute this week, and to avoid the university’s Westside Research Park facility at 2300 Delaware Ave.</summary><start-date>1583308800000</start-date><display-name>COVID-19 Precautions</display-name><path>/2020/03/genomics-covid19-precautions</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/03/genomics-covid19-precautions</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1583374845475</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594749385272</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In an abundance of caution, UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute staff have been advised to telecommute this week, and to avoid the university&#8217;s Westside Research Park facility at 2300 Delaware Ave.</p>
<p>This recommendation was made for the following reason: Two Genomics Institute affiliates visited the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative&#8217;s Bay Area facility last week. It was learned after their visit that a family member of a contract worker who also was working at the CZI facility Monday through Thursday of last week has tested positive for COVID&#8211;19. The contract worker is currently being tested for the virus and is in quarantine until results are received. Test results are expected at the end of this week.</p>
<p>CZI officials, out of extreme caution, have instructed their employees to work from home this week, and they are having their facility disinfected even though test results have yet to be returned.</p>
<p>It is unknown if the UCSC affiliates had contact with the contract scientist, as the contractor has not been identified.</p>
<p>The recommendation that Genomics Institute employees telecommute was made by the campus Office of Emergency Services, Student Health Services, and the campus Environmental Health and Safety office, with guidance from Santa Cruz County Health Services.</p>
<p>There is currently no recommendation to extend this precaution to additional occupants of the Delaware Avenue facility who were not present at the CZI facility last week.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early risers can take part once again in the Alumni Weekend 5K Fun Run, which starts at 8:30 a.m. on April 4 at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s East Field.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This fourth annual run is a chance for alumni, family, friends, staff, faculty, and community members to run through the rolling campus&#8217;s iconic spots. This year will also include a &#8220;mini Slug&#8221; 1K course for children, and organizers are strongly encouraging racers to wear costumes and Slug gear. As always, there will be treats on the East Field for all finishers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The race will raise money for UC Santa Cruz student scholarships. </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/fourth_annual_fun_run#.XmA_wRdKjGY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration is available</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many participants, the Fun Run is an exercise in nostalgia as well as physical stamina.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;d like to transport ourselves back to school&#8212;a time without responsibilities except for grades,&#8221; said Kate Grant Bateman (Cowell &#8217;98, American studies) after last year's Fun Run. She enjoyed the run, though she and several others got lost at one point.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At Kresge College, you&#8217;re supposed to make a right but we went straight," she said with a laugh. "We went the long way&#8212;all uphills.&#8221;</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1977, two spacecraft&#8212;Voyager 1 and 2&#8212;were launched into space carrying a pair of round metal plaques filled with information designed to acquaint any extraterrestrial who happened to find them with Earth and its inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Included on the covers of both those &#8220;Golden Records&#8221; was a starburst-shaped map, co-created by UC Santa Cruz Emeritus Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics Frank Drake. It used pulsars&#8212;rapidly spinning remains of dying stars that emit narrow beams of light&#8212;to help other intelligent life forms understand where our small orb is located.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That clever roadmap to Earth is just one of the more than 200 maps included in a book created by two graduates of the campus&#8217;s Science Communication Program, Betsy Mason and Greg Miller. Titled </span><a href="https://mapdragons.com/all-over-the-map-book/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Over The Map: A Cartographic Odyssey</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it was published in 2018 by National Geographic.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 320-page illustrated tome includes things like disturbingly accurate Russian spy maps; a diagram showing where to find booze during Prohibition in New York City; a chart of fracking wells in Williston, North Dakota; and a map showing the location of dozens of ships that were abandoned during California&#8217;s Gold Rush and still lie buried beneath San Francisco&#8217;s financial district. There is even a map of Westeros from HBO&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game of Thrones</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been intuitively drawn to maps because they are visually compelling,&#8221; said Miller, a former Stanford neuroscientist and current freelance journalist who lives in Portland, Ore. &#8220;Now (after doing research for the book and for a blog the pair created) I realize every good map also has a story to tell.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And tell, the duo did.</span></p>
<h3>Drawing out stories</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mason and Miller met at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s graduate Science Communication Program, then headed by John Wilkes. Each was coming off a career crisis. Mason, a Stanford-trained geologist, was working in the oil industry in Texas, and Miller had come to realize that spending all day in a lab was not his idea of happiness. Both were drawn to science journalism and UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually the pair landed jobs at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wired,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where they pitched the idea of a blog about maps, which sent them on a hunt that would last seven years and eventually result in a book deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During that time, the two unearthed spy maps, political maps, and maps of ancient cities. Some were beautifully wrought, others crudely drawn. Many of the diagrams were from the David Rumsey Map Collection at Stanford Libraries, which contains more than 150,000 maps, but others were from government files, archives, and obscure scientific papers. As the pair discovered, each map carried a story, too: stories of explorers, of propagandists, of scientists and criminals, of zealots and the obsessed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Mason, for instance, there was an adventurous museum director who, in the 1970s, couldn&#8217;t find a good map of the Grand Canyon for his and his wife&#8217;s visit. The man decided to make his own. Eight years and hundreds of thousands of dollars later, thanks to helicopter surveys and laser measurements, he had a stunningly detailed map of the chasm drawn by a special team of Swiss cartographers and published by National Geographic.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, there was the atlas that saved the lives of a bunch of 17</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-century English buccaneers. Coming home after years spent marauding off the coasts of South and Latin America, the pirates faced a possible death sentence, Miller said. Instead, the men handed King Charles II a hand-drawn copy of a book of sailing charts and navigation information they&#8217;d looted from a Spanish galleon. King Charles was so happy to have the information that he spared their lives.</span></p>
<h3>True map geek</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even though I thought I was a map geek before I started the blog, I really had very little appreciation for how wonderful maps were,&#8221; said Mason, who is headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area. &#8220;They are so much greater than I ever imagined. After seven years spent writing about maps, I love them more and more. Now, I think I qualify as a true map geek.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She&#8217;s such a map geek, Mason even tracked down the graphic designer who created the beautiful, medieval-looking map of the kingdom of Westeros that the diabolical queen, Cersei Lannister, commissioned during a season-seven episode of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game of Thrones</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After some negotiating, Mason managed to win permission to use the map in the book.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miller, who may have had an even tougher assignment, got the OK to publish the schematic of the Death Star from the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Wars</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> movie franchise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But ask the pair what&#8217;s the allure of maps to humans and they struggled to narrow down the reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think anybody who says they don&#8217;t like maps just hasn&#8217;t met the right map,&#8221; Mason said finally.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b125377480727017465cacce0cb92a4b"><name>taking-a-moment-to-say-thank-you</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Taking a moment to say thank you</title><summary>We want to take a moment to thank you for all you do to support our campus community.</summary><start-date>1583481600000</start-date><display-name>Taking a moment to say thank you</display-name><path>/2020/03/taking-a-moment-to-say-thank-you</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/03/taking-a-moment-to-say-thank-you</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1583519971156</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1583519971156</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Dear colleagues,&#160;</span></span></p>

You have faced significant disruption and uncertainty over the past three months.</span></p>
<p class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">However, I want to share with you that we now have 96% of fall grades submitted, and the faculty Academic Senate, which oversees grade policy, has made a decision on how instructors and departments may submit fall grades where they are missing. Faculty will be working over the coming weeks to implement this decision.&#160;If you are concerned that your winter grades may be withheld, there are a few options you can pursue now. You may reach out to your instructor, or the chair of the department sponsoring the course. You may also contact Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education Richard Hughey (</span><a class="mp4p" target="_blank"><span class="mp4p">vpdue@ucsc.edu</span></a><span class="mp4p">). They will be able to answer questions and provide further instruction.&#160;</span></p>
<p class="mp4p" dir="ltr"><span class="mp4p">I have heard from many of you that you are concerned with the enrollment limits placed on courses that are critical to meeting your degree requirements. Although realistically some students will not be able to access their first-choice classes in spring, departments have already increased spaces in courses in several majors. We are working hard to prioritize students who are applying to graduate in spring or fall, and we&#160; are committed to ensuring that you graduate as scheduled. If, after your enrollment appointment, you are unable to access classes that you need to graduate in spring, please reach out to your advisors who will assist you in staying on track.&#160;</span></p>

This information, along with additional guidance and resources, can be found on the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ucsc.edu/coronavirus/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1583608003286000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEQQEQnm-0yVoYrOj8cGT-MiUi0Jg" href="https://www.ucsc.edu/coronavirus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>UC Santa Cruz COVID-19 (coronavirus) web page</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Preparedness and Prevention</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To date, no one in Santa Cruz County or at UC Santa Cruz has tested positive for COVID-19.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I do want the campus to be aware that earlier this week we learned that two staff members with the Genomics Institute were at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) offices in Redwood City on February 27 and may have been exposed to COVID-19 through a contract worker on the Redwood City CZI site that day. That contract worker has now tested positive for COVID-19, but analysis has determined that neither of the two Genomics Institute staff are among the seven individuals who had close enough contact with the infected contract worker for direct transmission of the virus.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Nonetheless, in an abundance of caution, both UCSC employees have self-quarantined and are pursuing options for testing. We continue to believe that there is minimal risk to our employees.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Separately, one student receiving medical care off campus was tested on March 4 for COVID-19 after experiencing respiratory symptoms. That test came back negative on March 5. Out of an abundance of caution, UC Santa Cruz moved the student&#8217;s two roommates into quarantine housing after learning about the testing. With the negative test result, those two students have returned to their on-campus residence.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For now, the most important thing for you to do is stay home, rest and avoid contact with others if you are not feeling well. You should call your medical provider if you develop a cough, difficulty breathing, or a fever. Anyone with these symptoms AND recent travel to China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, or Japan should call their healthcare provider in advance and make arrangements to be evaluated. Students should call the Student Health Center at 831-459-2591 for instructions on self-care or to make an appointment. Please visit the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1583608003286000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMZvkeepD2ivORjyMIB9PgIGFV9Q" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Student Health Center website</span></a><span> for general health information.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Faculty, staff, and students are reminded to practice regular hand-washing, to cover one&#8217;s cough or sneeze with a tissue, and to regularly clean frequently touched surfaces. Those with respiratory symptoms should stay home to avoid infecting others.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Travel Restrictions and Registration</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>President Napolitano </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2020/01/letter-from-president-napolitano-march-5-2020.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1583608003286000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGGbAEdhjyZXb1UBrtCCmCPKDUEGA" href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2020/01/letter-from-president-napolitano-march-5-2020.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>issued a letter</span></a><span> on March 5 further restricting international travel in accordance with recent CDC guidance. This directive expands the existing travel restriction for CDC Level 3 countries (China, South Korea, Italy, Iran) to include CDC Level 2 countries (Japan). University travel between these countries and UC Santa Cruz is prohibited without prior approval from campus Risk Services.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Any travelers from a CDC Level 3 country, whether traveling for university or personal reasons, must self-quarantine for 14 days before returning to campus. The UC Santa Cruz Office of Emergency Services will assist with quarantine logistics for any on-campus residents and serve as a point of contact for those quarantining off campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>All international university travel must be registered in one of two ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Use the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://financial.ucsc.edu/Pages/Travel_Process.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1583608003286000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFHbhFYhf3lWbSoyRO8dGwPpKEAHA" href="https://financial.ucsc.edu/Pages/Travel_Process.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Connexxus system</span></a><span> to make reservations. This will automatically add your travel to the travel registry.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you do not use Connexxus for reservations, register your travel through the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ucop.edu/risk-services-travel/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1583608003286000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFj3UIGDtwvwtw4Y9p7mWZ_4sxCBQ" href="https://www.ucop.edu/risk-services-travel/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>UC Away system</span></a><span>.&#160;</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you are planning to travel for spring break, check the CDC and State Department travel advisories prior to departure. If you travel to a CDC Level 3 country, you will be required to quarantine for 14 days before returning to campus. Before returning to campus, undergraduate residential students who have recently traveled to these regions should contact their college&#8217;s senior director in order to identify an appropriate quarantine facility. Because of the restrictions on returning to the US, and the rapidly changing COVID-19 situation, international travel is not advised.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency Update</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Santa Cruz County Health Services, in coordination with the California Department of Public Health, is the lead agency for ensuring an effective communitywide response. The campus will follow guidance from Santa Cruz County and the California Department of Public Health with respect to cancellation of group events or classes. At this time, given the lack of community spread of COVID-19 in Santa Cruz County, UC Santa Cruz is not planning to cancel classes or suspend or modify operations.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In an effort to secure more support and resources in managing any potential coronavirus cases, the county Health Services Agency declared a local health emergency.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>According to the county, the declaration will empower it to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>More effectively respond to COVID-19,</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Seek and utilize mutual aid,</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Potentially obtain reimbursement, and</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Ensure that the county&#8217;s health professionals and other local stakeholders have all the necessary tools and powers at their disposal.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Support Resources</strong></p>

Santa Cruz County learned of its first confirmed case of COVID&#8211;19 on Saturday, March 7; this person is not affiliated with the UCSC campus. We expect that the number of confirmed cases will continue to climb with more widespread testing. Understandably, this possibility leads to elevated worry, concern, and anxiety, especially for those who have family in impacted regions or who are in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/index.html">higher-risk populations</a>.</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge the uncertainty, concern and worry that this virus and its consequences have created for so many in our community. Though there are no confirmed cases of the virus here on our campus, the first confirmed case could very well happen on campus at any time. We want to be as prepared as possible so we can move quickly should we need to.</p>
<h3>Campus Status</h3>
<p>The campus continues to remain open and operational. We are fortunate that no confirmed cases of COVID&#8211;19 have been reported at UCSC, but we continue to watch the global and regional situation carefully as we assess the local impact. After careful review of our local situation and following consultation with health professionals, we have assessed that the risk of transmission associated with classroom instruction remains low for our campus. We will continue to monitor and assess the risk, but at the present time, there is no reason for us to suspend normal instructional activity.</p>
<p><strong>To ensure that we are prepared, I am calling on all members of our community to take steps now to prepare for the possibility that we will need to shift to working, teaching, and learning remotely and virtually in the near future.</strong></p>
<p>You may have seen the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/03/educational-continuity-covid-19.html">memo to instructors</a> advising that they begin planning ways to offer course content and lectures outside of the classroom and predominantly online. To this point, the appropriate Academic Senate committees (Committee on Educational Policy, Committee on Courses of Instruction, and Graduate Council) agree that instructors may switch to Zoom-only with approval of the department chair (or equivalent head of the course sponsoring agency). Where practical, supervisors and managers may allow employees to work remotely. These are measures we can scale up quickly and broadly across campus.</p>
<p>We are aware that a small number of other universities, with different local circumstances, have suspended normal in-person classroom meetings. Rest assured: we are prepared to do the same should our local situation change. We are consulting on a daily basis with the local health officials and UC Office of the President. While we are not ending in-person classroom meetings at this time, we do understand the value of increased &#8220;social distancing&#8221; as a way of preventing the transmission of the virus. If the facts justify additional restrictive steps, we will be prepared to act quickly to adjust our practices to better protect the health of our community, including suspending in-person classroom meetings.</p>
<p>Should UCSC need to move to a hybrid or completely virtual instruction model, on-campus housing will remain open. Plans for managing confirmed cases within on-campus residents have been developed and will be implemented in consultation with local public health officials should it become necessary. Dining services will also continue to serve students with meal plans.</p>
<p>This situation is fluid, and it could change very quickly in the Santa Cruz area, requiring that we change course at a moment&#8217;s notice. We encourage you to stay up to date with the latest information on <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/coronavirus/index.html">our COVID&#8211;19 webpage</a> or the Office of the President&#8217;s <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus">COVID&#8211;19 webpage</a>.</p>
<h3>Travel Considerations</h3>
<p>The University of California revised its <a href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2020/01/letter-from-president-napolitano-march-5-2020.pdf">instructions on travel</a> on March 5th and further restrictions are anticipated as additional cases of COVID&#8211;19 are confirmed. Please consider the potential for additional countries to be added to the restricted travel list which could result in difficulties getting back into the US. Travelers should be prepared or arrange for off-campus accommodations to self-quarantine for 14 days upon your return from a restricted jurisdiction or if you are exposed to an individual suspected positive for COVID&#8211;19. Consult <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/coronavirus/index.html">our COVID&#8211;19 webpage</a> for the most up-to-date information on travel advice.</p>
<h3>Your Health and Wellness</h3>
<p>Finally and most importantly, it is crucial for all members of the UC Santa Cruz community to heed the recommendations for preventative care which have the greatest likelihood of protecting us as individuals, as well as the larger community, by diminishing the chances of transmission of the virus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds, or, as an alternative, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.</li>
<li>Stay home if you are sick and avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, throw the tissue in the trash, and wash your hands.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, it is recommended that people practice healthy habits: get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food. If you have not received your annual flu shot, please schedule one with your provider to help protect yourself against the flu.</p>
<p>Thank you for doing your part to protect our community. Please continue to look out for each other and to show kindness and support to all members of our campus community. Students, please share this message with your family and any other concerned parties.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c003401480727017465caccef1d96125"><name>mangroves</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Research shows mangrove conservation can pay for itself in flood protection</title><summary>A new global study shows that mangroves provide billions of dollars worth of flood risk reduction benefits every year.</summary><keywords>Michael Beck, Siddharth Narayan</keywords><start-date>1583834400000</start-date><display-name>Research shows mangrove conservation can pay for itself in flood protection</display-name><path>/2020/03/mangroves</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/03/mangroves</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1583769403382</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1583848796141</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/03/images/mangrove-diagram-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/03/images/mangrove-diagram-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mangrove-diagram-500.jpg</name><display-name>mangrove-diagram-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>113356</file-size><width>500</width><height>256</height></image><image-alt>coastal protection by mangroves</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/03/images/mangrove-diagram-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/03/images/mangrove-diagram-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mangrove-diagram-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>mangrove-diagram-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22957</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>coastal protection by mangroves</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>This illustration shows the impact of storm surge on coastal infrastructure and people with and without mangrove forests.

Without mangroves, flood damages would increase by more than $65 billion annually, and 15 million more people would be flooded, according to a new study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61136-6">published March 10 in <em>Scientific Reports</em></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mangroves provide incredibly effective natural defenses, reducing flood risk and damages,&#8221; said Pelayo Men&#233;ndez, a postdoctoral fellow in the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz and first author of the paper.</p>
<p>Climate change is increasing the risk of coastal flooding through its effects on sea level rise and the intensity of hurricanes. According to the study&#8217;s authors, conservation and restoration of natural defenses such as mangroves offers cost-effective ways to mitigate and adapt to these changes.</p>
<p>The researchers provided high-resolution estimates of the economic value of mangrove forests for flood risk reduction across more than 700,000 kilometers of coastlines worldwide. They combined engineering and economic models to provide the best analyses of coastal flood risk and mangrove benefits. Their results show when, where, and how mangroves reduce flooding, and they identified innovative ways to fund mangrove protection using economic incentives, insurance, and climate risk financing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that we can value these flood protection benefits, it opens all kinds of new opportunities to fund mangrove conservation and restoration with savings for insurance premiums, storm rebuilding, climate adaptation, and community development,&#8221; said coauthor Michael Beck, research professor in the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Mangrove forests occur in more than 100 countries globally. But many mangroves have been lost to aquaculture and coastal development, including the construction of public infrastructure such as ports and airports. In the early 1900s, vast areas of mangroves were filled throughout Florida, and whole developments were created where there once were islands and mangrove forests.</p>
<p>The loss of mangrove forests leads to increased coastal flooding, but these forests can be easily restored to make people and property safer, Beck said. Mangroves are resilient, and scientists know how to restore them&#8212;projects across Vietnam, Philippines, and Guyana have restored 100,000 hectares of mangroves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mangroves are resilient and can grow like weeds, even around cities, if we give them half a chance,&#8221; Beck said.</p>
<p>The new study rigorously valued the social and economic coastal protection benefits provided by mangroves globally. Many 20-kilometer coastal stretches, particularly those near cities, receive more than $250 million annually in flood protection benefits from mangroves.</p>
<p>The researchers are working with insurance companies, the World Bank, and conservation groups to use these results for risk reduction and conservation.</p>
<p>The study used the &#8220;expected damage function&#8221; approach, commonly used in engineering and insurance sectors to assess flooding. Hydrodynamic models were used to calculate the flooding that occurs globally under current and no-mangrove scenarios. By identifying the places where mangroves provide the greatest flood reduction benefits, this study informs policies for adaptation, sustainable development, and environmental restoration.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have combined rigorous tools from engineering and economics to show that mangroves really work for flood risk reduction,&#8221; said coauthor &#205;&#241;igo Losada, chief scientist at IH Cantabria.</p>
<p>In addition to Men&#233;ndez, Beck, and Losada, the coauthors of the paper include Saul Torres-Ortega at the University of Cantabria, Spain, and Siddharth Narayan at UC Santa Cruz. This work was supported by the World Bank and the German International Climate Initiative.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c03e7dff80727017465cacce917ba447"><name>preparing-for-possible-campus-suspension</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Preparing for possible campus suspension of in-person instruction and examinations </title><summary>As outlined in a previous campus communication, UCSC is continuing to take precautionary steps to prepare the campus for scenarios where COVID-19 makes large gatherings unsafe.</summary><start-date>1583737200000</start-date><display-name>Preparing for possible campus suspension of in-person instruction and examinations </display-name><path>/2020/03/preparing-for-possible-campus-suspension</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/03/preparing-for-possible-campus-suspension</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1583773285834</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594749759784</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As outlined in a previous campus communication, UCSC is continuing to take precautionary steps to prepare the campus for scenarios where COVID-19 makes large gatherings unsafe. As a result, we are advising instructors to prepare for the possible suspension of Winter quarter in-person instruction and in-person finals. Many instructors have already been using tools such as webcasting, Zoom, and Canvas to deliver instruction, and we ask those instructors who have not been doing so to consider how you might modify instruction in the event that classes can no longer meet in person. Comprehensive information is available listing <a href="https://its.ucsc.edu/fitc/course-dev/alternative-access.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">campus technological solutions and adaptations for instruction</a>.</p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Final Exams</strong></span><br/><br/>For Winter 2020, all instructors should prepare now for at least some students to be unable to attend the final exam in person. The health and safety of our community is our top priority, and we need to ensure that a sick student does not feel compelled to come to campus, which could pose a significant public health risk. <br/><br/>In addition, instructors should have a contingency plan in place should Winter quarter in-person final exams be suspended altogether. <br/><br/>Here are some principles to help guide instructors:<br/>
<ul>
<li>The recent <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Changes-to-Syllabus_Senate-Guideline.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Senate guidance on changes to a syllabus</a> recommends that &#8220;when making adjustments, faculty should make every effort to teach in a way that continues to support students in achieving the learning goals of the course, even as we recognize that some course elements may need to change due to extreme unplanned events such as campus closures.&#8221;</li>
<li>Focus on learning rather than testing. The priority in an emergency is not to replicate traditional in-person tests but to provide an opportunity for students to demonstrate and solidify their learning.</li>
<li>Options to demonstrate learning in lieu of traditional exams might include online exams (administered through Canvas), other forms of take home exams, project based learning, short student-made videos expressing learning (where appropriate), and a range of other <a href="https://citl.indiana.edu/teaching-resources/assessing-student-learning/alternatives-traditional-exams-papers/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">alternative assessments</a>.</li>
<li>Online proctoring may be available by request. Please email <a href="mailto:online@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">online@ucsc.edu</a> for more details. Due to high demand for this service among institutions around the country, the availability of online proctoring is limited, but UCSC will continue to work to make it available to interested instructors. Arrangements typically need to be made at least a week in advance. Campus resources may be available to cover the per-student costs. This will be discussed when contact is made with <a href="mailto:online@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">online@ucsc.edu</a>.</li>
<li>If a student is not able to complete the option(s) provided by the instructor, the student may be given an incomplete (I) at the student&#8217;s request if their work was of passing quality but incomplete. Instructors should be clear as to what needs to be done within the next quarter.</li>
<li>For take-home examinations and papers, rather than trying to eliminate cheating in at home environments, you may want to try the alternative of offering a different <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Planning-for-Exams-Assessments-and-Feedback-on-Student-Work.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">style of assessment</a> and messaging about <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Shifting-the-Focus-from-Stopping-Cheating-to-Promoting-Academic-Integrity.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">academic integrity</a>. Cheating is extremely difficult to eliminate. In-person exams do not always translate directly into remote environments. Designing assessments that make it difficult for students to cheat may be more practical than trying to stop cheating. For instance, open book exams that are time limited may make it less likely that students will cheat. Timed exams through Canvas or email that are sent out and returned at a specific time make it difficult for students to consult a lot of outside sources. Canvas can allow an instructor to restrict the IP address of the user. Finally, Canvas allows the use of quiz banks, so that questions can be shuffled, making it difficult for students to reliably collaborate, especially in timed environments.</li>
<li>Remember that students who have DRC accommodations will still need reasonable accommodations in alternative teaching and assessment environments. <a href="https://drc.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Consult directly with the DRC</a> if you have questions about accommodations.</li>
<li>Have a plan in place and discuss it with your students in the days prior to the exam if at all possible. &#8220;If campus is operating as normal, then X. If you are sick and unable to attend an in-person exam, then Y. If in-person final exams are cancelled, then Z.&#8221; Talk to students about how you may have to modify your original grading plan. Be transparent about what that will look like.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning and ITS have posted instructions and suggestions for instructors who need to <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Planning-for-Exams-Assessments-and-Feedback-on-Student-Work.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">modify examinations, assessments, and feedback</a> and/or <a href="https://its.ucsc.edu/fitc/course-dev/alternative-access.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">use technology for instruction</a> due to present circumstances. Additional online resources have just been developed for <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/teaching-resources/teaching-during-unplanned-events/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">instructional resilience during the COVID 19 outbreak</a> (and other unplanned events). CITL, FITC, and Online Education staff will be available in the coming days to consult individually with instructors both about finishing Winter 2020 courses and planning for possible contingencies in Spring. An email to <a href="mailto:citl@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">citl@ucsc.edu</a>, <a href="mailto:fitc@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fitc@ucsc.edu</a>, or <a href="mailto:online@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">online@ucsc.edu</a> will connect you with staff, who will route your question to the appropriate person in their own or another unit.</p>
Remember that some students may not have access to a computer or to high-speed internet at home. If in-person classes are suspended, instructors should not require students to come to campus to access the internet or other facilities. Instructors should consider if there are ways to allow students to complete assignments without internet access, such as having students do some forms of work and take a picture with their phones, sending it in on the cellular network. Note: for proctored online examinations, high-speed internet access is essential.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Good communication is key</strong></span><br/>
<ul>
<li>It is important to recognize that many students have significant anxiety around assessment and that all students are likely to be experiencing higher than normal levels of stress associated with the strike/protest and COVID-19. Clear and positive communication with students about the event and how you will handle assessments can help alleviate anxiety.</li>
<li>Avoid changing the format of the assessment multiple times if possible. If you need to change the format or date, be transparent about why and what information you are using to make the decision and when you plan to let students know the plan. Acknowledge that the situation may be less than ideal but that you are focused on providing the best learning experience possible under the circumstances.</li>
<li>Keep any Teaching Assistants, Readers, or other instructional staff apprised of planned changes. Communicate your expectations and clarify their roles.</li>
<li>If able, you might ask students for their feedback about possible alternatives for assessment. Giving students the chance to weigh in on these decisions can help them feel more in control of the situation.</li>
</ul>
Unplanned events can make assessment of student work challenging. Maintaining a focus on learning outcomes can make decisions about what mode of assessment to use clearer. And finally, good communication with students throughout is essential to help alleviate stress and help students maintain focus on their learning in the face of uncertainty.<br/><br/>Thank you for your assistance in this dynamic environment.

So she speaks with authority and experience when she says that the coronavirus is &#8220;different from anything we have ever seen before.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Garrett is a leading expert on global health, with a particular focus on newly emerging and re-emerging diseases and their effects on foreign policy and national security. She has been watching the coronavirus outbreak closely and speaking with <a href="#https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/u-s-unready-to-deal-with-potential-coronavirus-spread-79446085581">news media including MSNBC</a> to impart knowledge and combat the spread of misinformation.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>The novel coronavirus "has something in common with SARS [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome], MERS [Middle East Respiratory Syndrome], and the common cold, but with a lot of nuances that we haven&#8217;t seen before," said Garrett. &#8220;It is possible for people to seem completely cured and a couple of weeks later be dying of the disease.&#8221;</p>
<p>COVID-19, or coronavirus disease 2019, is comparatively less deadly than either SARS or MERS, Garrett said.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not ultra-ultra-lethal, so we need a better understanding of what makes COVID-19 dangerous, putting people in intensive hospital care for two or three weeks. Roughly a quarter of all cases seem to go severe, and require long-term hospitalization, and yet the death rate is comparatively low.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</p>
<h3>Community responses to a global health crisis</h3>
<p>To deal with such a contagious viral infection, which can now be found across the globe in every continent except for Antarctica, requires creative thinking and careful coordination, at the national as well as the local level.&#160;</p>
<p>To illustrate this idea, she gave an example of attending a co-op board meeting for a 27-floor apartment building in New York City. She suggested that the building could take a detailed census of its most vulnerable residents.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who in our building is elderly and might need assistance? Who are all those single moms with three kids? Who has recently suffered an injury and needs help?" she said. "We should have some system in place to look in on them, to get extra groceries for them if we get into a lockdown situation in this part of New York City.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said similar efforts can take place in communities all over the nation, including the UC Santa Cruz campus and in the Santa Cruz community at large.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone defines community differently, right?&#8221; she said. &#8220;It might be your church, or Merrill College, or it might be all the people who love to go dancing out on the Santa Cruz Wharf. Whatever your community is, you have the opportunity to take leadership right now. This is the chance to say, &#8216;Here are the things we're doing as a community that might be risky right now, and here is how we change our behavior, and here are the people who might need a little extra help.'&#8221;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Garrett has been outspoken about the Trump administration&#8217;s <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2020/2/3/laurie_garrett_coronavirus_trump_admin_response">handling of the outbreak</a>, as well as its earlier decision to disband programs that were instituted during the Obama administration to assess and respond to epidemics. She wrote an opinion piece for foreignpolicy.com detailing the &#8220;overt lies and cover-ups&#8221; from the Chinese government in its initial response to the outbreak. As a guest on <em>Democracy Now,</em> she said that if she could &#8220;wave a magic wand,&#8221; she would have had testing in January for every patient inside intensive care wards who was diagnosed with &#8220;some mysterious viral pneumonia&#8221; that was not flu or bacterial in origin.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not just saying this in hindsight," she said. &#8220;I was saying this back in January.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>But she said that communities, at least, could institute a thoughtful and carefully coordinated response to the crisis. She urged local governments to set up coronavirus hotlines&#8212;one for anyone worried that they had the virus and needing special assistance and another for volunteers wanting to help out. Such centralized hotlines will be extremely important &#8220;if this really keeps going and we end up with a China-scale or South Korea&#8211;scale epidemic on our hands. If this happens, there will come a moment when chains of supply become a real issue, as more and more truck drivers take ill and go into quarantine.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>If this happens, getting fruits and vegetables grown in Santa Cruz County to grocery stores will be a pressing issue.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;This could conceivably be handled by a well-orchestrated volunteer situation,&#8221; said Garrett.</p>
<h3>Future outcomes and best-/worst-case scenarios</h3>
<p>While Garrett had detailed advice about mutual aid in communities, she was less than optimistic regarding the future of the epidemic.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see what happens with trying to come up with a vaccine," she said. To pull off such a feat, &#8220;we would have to perform a miracle that we have never previously performed, meaning manufacturing enough safely and affordably so the world could be vaccinated, including the most remote parts of Chad or communities in the high Tibetan plateaus.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>But such an effort would make the eradication of smallpox &#8220;seem like small potatoes" in comparison. If there is sufficient vaccine, it could be possible to swoop into communities, vaccinate everyone, and stop this from returning as a future pandemic, she said.</p>
<p>But a more likely scenario is a long-term problem, she said. The virus is already in both hemispheres. It has emerged in South Africa, New Zealand, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Chile.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We could see it go somewhat like a recurring influenza that peters out in the summer in the Northern Hemisphere but comes in hard at the same time in the Southern Hemisphere, then reverses, year in and year out, and becomes a routine additional burden as a cause of morbidity and mortality for humanity for decades,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, I&#8217;d say the track record on the other two prominent coronaviruses is a bad omen,&#8221; she said, referring to SARS and MERS. SARS appeared in 2003, and MERS appeared in 2013, &#8220;and we don&#8217;t have a SARS vaccine, and we don&#8217;t have a MERS vaccine.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>She is especially worried about the spread of the virus in places that have large concentrations of people living closely together without proper medical care, including refugee camps in the Middle East, and the Rohingya camps in Bangladesh.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We could see widespread transmission go on for quite a while before it is even noticed by medical providers, and of course these places don&#8217;t have hospitals or state-of-the-art medicine,&#8221; said Garrett.&#160;</p>
<p>She also worries about situations closer to home, including homeless encampments, whose populations will be especially vulnerable.&#160;</p>
<h3>Working together and combating misinformation</h3>
<p>In the face of such a contagious virus, she said that communities should also do their best to fight against false information.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are clearly racing to keep ahead of&#8212;or keep up with&#8212;the liars and conspiracy theories," she said. "It is really out of control.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>She is especially concerned with &#8220;trolls&#8221; who downplay the severity of the coronavirus and the need to prepare communities. Garrett is also doing her best to disseminate <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/25/wuhan-coronavirus-safety-china/">her list of &#8220;10 simple precautions" to stop the spread of the coronavirus.</a>&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>She also urged communities to start brainstorming about volunteer efforts and leadership roles right now instead of waiting for the situation to get any worse. It is time to pose such questions as: Where is your extended family, who are your neighbors, whom may you call upon, and who can call upon you for assistance?&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of this thinking has to happen <em>now</em>," she said. &#8220;People have to do this <em>before</em> they are around others who are sick.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/03/images/lauriegarrett-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/03/images/lauriegarrett-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lauriegarrett-featured.jpg</name><display-name>lauriegarrett-featured.jpg</display-name><file-size>17956</file-size><width>400</width><height>192</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Laurie Garrett</thumb-alt><title>Laurie Garrett: Pandemics Expert Speaks</title><description>Alumna Laurie Garrett was in China during the SARS epidemic, and won a Pulitzer Prize for chronicling the Ebola virus outbreak in Zaire.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She will represent UC Santa Cruz at the UC Office of the President&#8217;s Grad Slam May 8&#160; in San Francisco.&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Runner up was Abel Mkulama, a first-year masters student in coastal science and policy. He won $1,500 for his presentation on how briquets can prevent deforestation and save lives in Malawi.&#160;</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klein&#8217;s presentation &#8220;Using zombie insects to find a cure for cancer&#8221; won $3,000 for first place and an additional $750 for the People&#8217;s Choice Award. <br/></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klein, from Golden, Colo, said figuring out exactly how medicines from natural sources function in the human body excites her in her research.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mkulama, grew up in a remote village in Malawi where he didn&#8217;t use electricity until age 16.

<li><strong>Beginning Wednesday, March 11, lecture courses (including discussion sections) and seminars will be offered through alternative modalities (e.g., Zoom) to reduce face-to-face interactions as much as possible.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lab and studio courses that must meet in person because alternative instruction outside of the classroom is not appropriate can continue to meet in person where necessary.&#160;</strong></li>
<li><strong>In-person winter quarter final exams will be conducted via alternate means - not in person. Instructors will be communicating with their students this week about alternative plans for assessment on a course-by-course basis.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The first week of spring quarter, Monday, March 30, though Friday, April 3, will also follow this model with lecture courses and discussion sections delivered remotely.</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>EVENTS</strong><br/>
<ul>
<li><strong>Per CDC guidance, crowds should be avoided. As such, all campus-sponsored events with plans for more than 50 attendees (based on county guidance) will be canceled or postponed.&#160;</strong>These include events put on by the administration or academic departments and scheduled to take place through Friday, April 3. Further guidance will be forthcoming regarding student organization events.</li>
<li><strong>For campus-sponsored events with fewer than 50 attendees, we strongly encourage planners of those events to explore alternatives to in-person gatherings.</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>CAMPUS OPERATIONS</strong><br/><br/><strong>The campus is <em>not closing.</em> Campus buildings will remain open, and many campus operations, including student housing and dining, health services and research support operations, will continue to provide services, though some services may be modified as conditions change.</strong> <br/><br/><strong>While the campus will remain open, we encourage all students who are able to do so return to their permanent residence and continue their studies remotely through April 3.</strong> We know this is not possible for all students, however reducing the number of people on campus will increase the safety of all, and allow those who remain on campus to better practice social distancing. Additional guidance about the spring quarter will be provided prior to April 3 based on the latest available coronavirus information. <br/><br/>Some limitations in operations and services may arise as managers may be allowing their employees to work remotely, when possible. More communications to managers and employees about working remotely will be provided shortly. In addition, a message outlining additional adjustments to campus operations, events and travel will be issued shortly.<br/><br/>We understand that implementing these changes with such limited notice may be challenging and disruptive, and we appreciate your patience and cooperation. The safety of our campus community is our highest priority. We are grateful to the community members throughout our campus for their tremendous efforts during these challenging times, especially our front-line staff who serve in health care, custodial, and food service roles.<br/><br/>We will continue to update you on this issue with the latest information on our <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/coronavirus/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">COVID-19 webpage</a> or the Office of the President&#8217;s <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus" rel="noopener" target="_blank">COVID-19 webpage</a>.<br/><br/>Please continue to look out for each other and to show kindness and support to all members of our campus community. Students, please share this message with your families and any concerned parties.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c5b1621a80727017465cacce44774c0a"><name>suspension-of-in-person-classes-and-finals</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Suspension of in-person classes and final exams</title><summary>Earlier today, the Chancellor announced new actions designed to help limit coronavirus (COVID-19) risk on campus.

In recent days we have seen the continued spread of COVID-19 around the world and now here in Santa Cruz County. We can expect that confirmed cases will continue to grow in our region and in our campus community. There are no confirmed cases on our campus at this time.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The public health guidance we are receiving continues to emphasize not only good personal hygiene practices, but also minimizing close contact among groups of people, as means of restraining the spread of COVID-19. We are placing constraints on large public events at UC Santa Cruz, and now we are taking steps regarding course instruction.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>For the final three (3) days of the winter quarter, beginning Wednesday March 11, through the first week of spring quarter, Friday April 3, we will be suspending most in-person classes and will be offering all lecture courses (including discussion sections) and seminar instruction through <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://its.ucsc.edu/fitc/course-dev/alternative-access.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1583950621794000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGOsFWXG9wz5wmuFpjx5rGKtN1YzA" href="https://its.ucsc.edu/fitc/course-dev/alternative-access.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">alternative modalities</a> (e.g., <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cHSbDr6boxZCdDyP2rmrO12xlH-i1v0E0ckJDL_kTtc/edit&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1583950621794000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMRDMR89ycN6bkTHwATw-xCt3a-g" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cHSbDr6boxZCdDyP2rmrO12xlH-i1v0E0ckJDL_kTtc/edit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zoom</a>). </strong><span>Wherever possible, instruction should be carried out through Zoom meetings.

<p dir="ltr"><span>For final exams and end-of-quarter assessment of student performance, instructors may also need to consider options such as: electronic submission of final papers, projects, and take-home examinations; and proctored online examinations.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If a student is not able to complete the option(s) provided by the instructor, the student may be given an incomplete (I) at the student&#8217;s request if their work was of passing quality but incomplete.

She receives a $45,000 prize from ISSF for her contest entry, &#8220;Incentivizing Collaborative Release to Reduce Elasmobranch Bycatch Mortality,&#8221; which proposes handling-and-release methods that purse-seine vessel skippers and crew can use to reduce the mortality of manta rays and devil rays incidentally caught during tuna fishing.</p>
<p>Cronin&#8217;s winning proposal calls for cooperative workshops with purse-seine skippers and observers, offering financial rewards for the design, testing, and onboard implementation of feasible, scalable techniques for safely removing rays from vessel decks. It also includes training observers in tagging rays to track their post-release survival.</p>
<p>Rays and sharks are the species groups most vulnerable in the purse-seine fishery. In the Indian Ocean, for example, rays comprise the majority of by-catch in tuna fishers&#8217; free-school sets. By-catch overall on such sets represents 0.9% of the total catch, and 34% of that is rays.</p>
<p>Cronin is a member of the <a href="https://ccal.ucsc.edu/">Conservation Action Lab</a> at UC Santa Cruz led by EEB Professor Donald Croll and Adjunct Professor Bernie Tershy. She was awarded a Switzer Environmental Fellowship in 2019.</p>
<p>In addition to the $40,000 Grand Prize, the ISSF award includes a trip, with an estimated $5,000 value, to a tuna event. ISSF will arrange for Cronin to present her proposal at a Regional Fisheries Management Organization (RFMO) event this year.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://iss-foundation.org/">International Seafood Sustainability Foundation</a> (ISSF) is a global coalition of scientists, the tuna industry, and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) promoting science-based initiatives for the long-term conservation and sustainable use of tuna stocks, reducing bycatch, and promoting ecosystem health.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://iss-foundation.org/investigating-collaborative-solutions-to-protect-threatened-manta-rays/</url><title>Blog Post by Melissa Cronin</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c63e302d80727017465cacce59e5be61"><name>operational-changes-in-response-to-covid19-virus</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Operational changes in response to COVID-19 virus</title><summary>As outlined earlier this morning by Chancellor Larive, UC Santa Cruz is making adjustments to the delivery of classes and the administration of final exams in response to the COVID-19 virus.

While we do not have a confirmed case on campus, there are confirmed cases in Santa Cruz County, and we are working to be proactive in supporting the health and safety of our campus community. <br/><br/>In addition to the adjustments in instruction and final-exam administration, and consistent with consultation with our campus emergency management experts, we are making the following adjustments and recommendations related to campus operations. This guidance applies to all campus locations. There could be additional guidance that applies to locations outside of Santa Cruz County should local circumstances warrant it. Note that this guidance is based on the situation as we know it today. Some recommendations may adjust as conditions change. Continue to check for <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/coronavirus/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">online updates</a>. In addition, questions can be sent to <a href="mailto:publicaffairs@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</a>. Finally, we will be hosting online town halls to provide further guidance and answer questions you might have about the campus response. Information about those online town halls will be forthcoming.<br/><br/><strong>Sanitation</strong></p>
<p>We are proactively implementing a plan to provide a higher level of sanitation for campus public areas such as building entries, lobbies, restrooms, classrooms, teaching laboratories, libraries, dining halls and other spaces where a large number of people are present or pass through daily. In addition, we are working to expand the locations and number of hand-sanitizing stations across campus. We are also expanding educational information posted across campus outlining the actions all members of the community can take to promote sanitary environments.<br/><br/><strong>Telecommuting</strong></p>
<p>Where feasible, and until at least April 3, supervisors and managers should encourage telecommuting. For positions where telecommuting is not possible, managers and supervisors should work with staff to ensure they have guidance on how to deal with personal health or issues arising from an illness in their family. To ensure staff do not feel compelled to come to work while ill due to a concern about a lack of sick leave balance, UC has issued new guidance on paid leave and remote working provisions. This <a href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2020/01/guidance-regarding-paid-leave-and-remote-work-provisions.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guidance</a> can be found online.<br/><br/><strong>Travel</strong></p>
<p>Effective immediately, we are recommending the following adjustments to campus travel taking place through April 3. These changes may be expanded beyond that date should conditions warrant.<br/><br/>All non-essential business-related staff and faculty travel that is scheduled to take place prior to April 3 should be canceled. The determination of essential will be up to the principal officer overseeing the unit.<br/><br/>Those who are overseeing university-sponsored student trips and programs should assess if changes should be made to travel plans and if cancelation is appropriate based on the logistics of the trip, modality of travel, and the destination. Individuals should consult their principal officers as needed in assessing changes.<br/><br/>In Chancellor Larive&#8217;s message, she suggested students who are able to should return to their permanent residence and continue their studies remotely through April 3. Students unable to travel or return home during this time due to conditions in their destination or due to other health considerations where travel poses a risk may remain on campus. There will be dining options available, though some services might be adapted as conditions change.<br/><br/>In addition to the travel guidance outlined here, the <a href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2020/01/letter-from-president-napolitano-march-5-2020.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously communicated travel directives outlined by the UC Office of the President</a> remain in effect. <br/><br/><strong>Events taking place on campus or sponsored by campus</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For all events scheduled to take place prior to April 3, we recommend the following:<br/>Cancel events with an anticipated in-person attendance over 50. This number is consistent with <a href="https://www.santacruzhealth.org/Portals/7/Pdfs/Coronavirus/3-9-20%20Interim%20Social%20Distancing%20Guidance%20Final.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guidance from the Santa Cruz County Health Department</a>. This includes events where the university is providing space to an outside host.</li>
<li>For campus-sponsored events with fewer than 50 attendees, we strongly encourage planners of those events to explore alternatives to in-person gatherings.</li>
<li>Campus tours, yield events, and other visitor programs should be canceled and sponsors should consider offering online or virtual campus outreach where feasible and appropriate for program outcomes.</li>
<li>Arts performances and lectures where social distancing is not possible and/or where attendees are likely to travel from other regions of the state, country or globe should be canceled. Performances and lectures that are tied to instruction and/or final exams should follow the guidance provided in the earlier messages from Chancellor Larive and iCPEVC Kletzer.</li>
</ul>
<p>This event guidance could be extended past April 3 if conditions warrant. In addition, units should cease booking any new campus events scheduled for March and April where event characteristics match those outlined above.<br/><br/><strong>Campus meetings</strong></p>
<p>Where possible, campus departments should utilize Zoom (or alternative services) for meetings to reduce travel on campus or between campus locations. For in-person meetings, social distancing practices should be followed. The guidance above related to gatherings involving more than 50 participants should also be used when making determinations about meeting alterations and cancelations.<br/><br/><strong>Research business continuity</strong></p>
<p>Principal officers should ensure that PIs have updated their continuity plans to deal with research needs, such as dealing with sensitive materials in labs that require oversight, in the event the PI becomes ill or the campus has to further curtail operations. The Office of Research has been working to support this and is engaged with researchers to assist in this effort.<br/><br/>In addition to the items outlined above, our campus emergency response team, in partnership with units across campus, continues to work daily to ensure our response plans are robust in the event we have a confirmed case of COVID-19 on campus or face escalation of illness in our city and county. Our primary focus is ensuring we can support the health and safety of our campus community.<br/><br/>Thank you for your support as we undertake these operational changes.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz campus community</audience><admin>Sarah Latham, Vice Chancellor, Business and Administrative Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ca898e8180727017465cacce3d153449"><name>mirror-technology</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC thin-film expertise to help develop NASA’s next generation of space telescopes</title><summary>Engineer Nobuhiko Kobayashi's expertise in thin-film technology could improve the performance of NASA’s next generation of space telescopes.</summary><start-date>1583910000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC thin-film expertise to help develop NASA’s next generation of space telescopes</display-name><path>/2020/03/mirror-technology</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/03/mirror-technology</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1583945977445</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1583946204706</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>James McGirk</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcgirk@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/03/images/nobby-kobayashi-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/03/images/nobby-kobayashi-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nobby-kobayashi-400.jpg</name><display-name>nobby-kobayashi-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>97514</file-size><width>400</width><height>479</height></image><image-alt>Nobuhiko Kobayashi</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/03/images/nobby-kobayashi-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/03/images/nobby-kobayashi-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nobby-kobayashi-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>nobby-kobayashi-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23301</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Nobuhiko Kobayashi</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Nobuhiko Kobayashi</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Nobuhiko Kobayashi, professor of electrical and computer engineering at UC Santa Cruz, began his career developing thin-film transistors required for controlling liquid crystal displays. Thirty years later, his expertise in thin films could improve the performance of NASA&#8217;s next generation of space telescopes that employ optical mirrors based on complex thin-film structures.<br/><br/>Kobayashi&#8217;s Nanostructured Energy Conversion Technology and Research (NECTAR) lab at UC Santa Cruz has received funding from NASA and will work with teams at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena and the University of Colorado, Boulder, to develop high performance, durable, and large-scale protected aluminum-based mirrors for the spectral range covering the far ultraviolet (FUV) and the near infrared (NIR), using distinctive atomic layer deposition capabilities established at NECTAR.<br/><br/>Kobayashi never expected to be working with telescopes, let alone ones that would orbit planet Earth.<br/><br/>&#8220;This all started as a skunkworks project we did with the UC Observatories,&#8221; Kobayashi said. &#8220;Six years ago, Prof. Joseph Miller, a former director of UC Observatories, and Prof. Andrew Phillips approached me saying they were interested in improving the performance of very large and thick mirrors based on silver for their ground-based astronomical telescopes.&#8221;<br/><br/>Silver-based mirrors can degrade and are vulnerable to a range of structural degradations when exposed to the environment in which ground-based astronomical telescopes operate. Traditional protective coatings are difficult to apply without changing a mirror&#8217;s reflective qualities. Kobayashi realized he could use thin-film manufacturing processes to improve a mirror&#8217;s optical performance and long-term endurance.<br/><br/>Kobayashi implemented a technique borrowed from the microelectronics industry called atomic layer deposition (ALD) to apply a thin film of aluminum oxide (a sort of &#8220;sapphire&#8221;), creating an extremely uniform layer only a few atoms thick. Silver surfaces coated with this method were protected from the operational environments, with very little distortion.<br/><br/>John Hennessy, a technologist at NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, heard Kobayashi describe the technique at an International Society for Optics and Photonics conference in San Diego. Hennessy told Kobayashi that NASA was developing aluminum-based mirrors for the next generation of space-based astronomical telescopes, and he wondered whether it would be possible to scale up ALD to develop a protective coating for an aluminum mirror.<br/><br/>An aluminum-based mirror has both advantages and disadvantages, Kobayashi said. &#8220;An aluminum-based mirror, in contrast to silver-based mirrors, can go all the way into the far ultraviolet. However, aluminum is a tricky material to work with because it gets oxidized so easily,&#8221; he said.<br/><br/>Creating a mirror that would be able to function in orbit was another hurdle.<br/><br/>&#8220;In space, there&#8217;s all kinds of ionizing radiation that can damage mirrors, so the surface of aluminum-based mirrors needs to be protected by a coating,&#8221; Kobayashi said. &#8220;The biggest challenge is developing a robust protective coating transparent to the FUV spectral range without hampering the optical performance of the mirrors.&#8221;<br/><br/>Not many materials are transparent to the FUV spectral range. The aluminum oxide protective coating used for silver-based mirrors wouldn&#8217;t work in this instance, so Kobayashi&#8217;s team will begin exploring compounds that contain fluorine.<br/><br/>&#8220;Unlike such metal oxides as aluminum oxide, for which well-established ALD processes exist, metal fluorides need to be extensively investigated in terms of choosing fluorine-containing precursors and designing ALD processes appropriate for mirrors used in astronomical telescopes,&#8221; Kobayashi said.<br/><br/>The project is unique in the sense that it brings together multiple disciplines at UC Santa Cruz: astronomy, materials science, and engineering.<br/><br/>&#8220;I am grateful for strong endorsement and continuous support by Brian Dupraw, Chris Ratliff, Prof. Andrew Phillips, Prof. Michael Bolte, and Prof. Claire Max of the UC Observatories,&#8221; Kobayashi said. "I would also like to thank Dr. David Fryauf, a former Ph.D. student and postdoctoral fellow now at Intel, for his great contribution to the preliminary work."</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cad437c280727017465cacceee662f7f"><name>changes-to-vision-talk-format-for-vcur-candidates</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Changes to vision talk format for Vice Chancellor of University Relations candidates</title><summary>In order to align with the COVID-19 public event guidance issued yesterday, we are canceling the Vice Chancellor of University Relations candidate in-person vision talks scheduled to take place this month. </summary><start-date>1583910000000</start-date><display-name>Changes to vision talk format for Vice Chancellor of University Relations candidates</display-name><path>/2020/03/changes-to-vision-talk-format-for-vcur-candidates</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/03/changes-to-vision-talk-format-for-vcur-candidates</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1583950870432</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1583950976825</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>In order to align with the COVID-19 public event guidance issued yesterday, we are canceling the Vice Chancellor of University Relations candidate in-person vision talks scheduled to take place this month.

<p>Haney had spent the day interviewing an inmate at San Quentin State Prison, and as he crossed the Golden Gate Bridge, he was struck by the consistent themes of abuse and deprivation that he'd heard during previous such interviews he&#8217;d conducted with men on Death Row.</p>
<p>Back on campus, Haney mentioned the patterns he was seeing to senior colleagues, who were skeptical. There wasn't much literature to suggest that early trauma could so profoundly shape adult behavior, and certainly not adult criminal behavior. There was an occasional suggestive study, but no solid database or convincing theory to support Haney's hypothesis.</p>
<p>What a difference four decades makes.</p>
<p>Haney, now a distinguished professor of psychology, is the author of the new book <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/books/criminality-context-criminal-justice-reform"><em>Criminality in Context: The Psychological Foundations of Criminal Justice Reform</em></a>. The book is a comprehensive, in-depth analysis of 40 years of research into the root causes of criminal behavior. Haney's conclusions about the key role of preventable trauma and structural injustice also upend conventional thinking about how to bring about real reform in the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>"The nation&#8217;s dominant narrative about crime is that it is committed by bad people who freely choose to make bad decisions, persons who are fundamentally different from the rest of us" said Haney, who holds psychology and law degrees. "The only thing that is fundamentally different about them is the lives they&#8217;ve lived and the structural impediments they&#8217;ve faced."</p>
<p>Thousands of studies have been conducted since the day Haney took that fateful drive over the Golden Gate Bridge. They clearly establish that the people who are most at risk for criminal behavior are those who have been exposed to numerous traumas or &#8220;risk factors&#8221; in their lives, often beginning in childhood. The long-term impact of abuse and neglect is often compounded by additional mistreatment at the hands of the very institutions charged with protecting them, including schools, the foster care system, and the juvenile justice system, he said.</p>
<p>Haney's expertise on capital punishment and the psychological effects of incarceration have made him a leading voice in <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/02/haney-testimony.html">criminal justice reform</a>. He has provided key testimony in major legal challenges regarding the death penalty, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/haney-canada.html">solitary confinement</a><span>,</span> and <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2009/02/2730.html">prison overcrowding</a>. His previous books include <em>Reforming Punishment: Psychological Limits to the Pains of Imprisonment</em>, and <em>Death by Design: Capital Punishment as a Social Psychological System</em>.</p>
<p><em><u>"Poverty and race are intertwined in our society"</u></em></p>
<p>In addition, Haney argues, poverty and racism are major structural factors that contribute to crime. "Ninety percent of people in prison are poor, and the majority are people of color," said Haney.</p>
<p>Poverty is a &#8220;gateway&#8221; risk factor that exposes people to other forms of trauma, ensures a range of unmet needs, and can constrict opportunities over an entire life course, he said. Because race and poverty are so deeply intertwined in our society, people of color are more likely to confront these challenges. This fact, and their differential treatment at the hands of criminal justice system, accounts for their overrepresentation in our prisons.</p>
<p>If social, economic, and racial injustices are the real causes of criminal behavior, Haney argues, then the only real path to reducing crime is to meaningfully target them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamental criminal justice reform will require us to change our conceptions of who commits crime and why," said Haney. "It isn't about individual pathologies. It's about pathological social histories and circumstances. We know this not because it's politically liberal or progressive to say so. We know it because there&#8217;s a mountain of data telling us it&#8217;s true."</p>
<p>If we don't change the narrative to align with hard scientific evidence, he said, genuine and lasting criminal justice reform is unlikely to ever succeed. Misplaced efforts like the War on Drugs in the 1980s and '90s exacerbated economic and racial inequality with policies that encouraged police departments to arrest and imprison more people, ushering in the era of mass incarceration that persists today.</p>
<p>Now, enlightened by scientific evidence and an overarching analysis of the causes of crime, Haney is advocating for "fundamental changes in the way we respond to crime and how we approach crime prevention." Both efforts&#8212;a much fairer set of legal responses and a more effective approach to prevention&#8212;must take adverse social histories and structural injustice into account, he said.</p>
<p>"Right now, death penalty cases are the only ones where a person&#8217;s background and circumstances are seriously considered in the sentencing process. Otherwise these things are largely excluded and ignored, and judges have very little latitude to take them into account," said Haney, who believes personal history and context are nonetheless relevant at every step of the adjudication process.</p>
<p>Similarly, to be effective, crime prevention strategies must focus on massive structural changes, including a serious effort to alleviate poverty.</p>
<p>"Addressing the terrible consequences of poverty and economic inequality is important in its own right, but also should be seen as advancing the goal of crime prevention," said Haney. "Reducing crime and poverty are part of the same social justice agenda."</p>

<p>Principal officers have been asked to provide guidance to their teams that is in alignment with the functions of their respective divisions. Our campus is also following system-wide guidance from the Office of the President (OP) (<a href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2020/01/guidance-regarding-paid-leave-and-remote-work-provisions.pdf">Guidance from OP</a>) that is described below.</p>
<p>We need to maintain many regular operations while much of our instruction is being transitioned to an online format. Your support is critical to providing increased &#8220;social distancing&#8221; and other healthy practices. Modifications to an employee&#8217;s regular work location, assignments, and schedule should be considered on a case by case basis by the responsible manager.</p>
<p>These five (5) important temporary system-wide emergency provisions now apply at our campus until further notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employees unable to work due to their own or a family member&#8217;s COVID&#8211;19 illness should use available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, vacation, PTO-sick, or other accrued leave), and if all available leave balances have been exhausted, the University will provide up to fourteen (14) days paid administrative leave to cover the absence. Supervisors/managers are required to submit a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQrWaOYOE-U7r5BUCV1jGXHMTSC04mCe6MHzrLJllTkKecuw/viewform">Request for Paid Administrative Leave</a> for each employee who needs paid administrative leave.</li>
<li>Employees unable to come to work due to public health or University-required quarantine or self-isolation measures may work remotely if operationally feasible, as determined by the supervisor. If remote work is not operationally feasible, employees should use available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, vacation, PTO-sick, or other accrued leave), and if all available leave balances have been exhausted, the University will provide up to fourteen (14) days paid administrative leave to cover the absence. Supervisors/managers are required to submit a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQrWaOYOE-U7r5BUCV1jGXHMTSC04mCe6MHzrLJllTkKecuw/viewform">Request for Paid Administrative Leave</a> for each employee who needs paid administrative leave.</li>
<li>Employees unable to come to work due to a COVID&#8211;19 day care or school closure that requires them to be home with their child may work remotely if operationally feasible; if remote work is not operationally feasible, employees may use available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, vacation, PTO-sick, or other accrued leave), and if all available leave balances have been exhausted, the University will provide up to fourteen (14) days paid administrative leave to cover the absence. Supervisors/managers are required to submit a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQrWaOYOE-U7r5BUCV1jGXHMTSC04mCe6MHzrLJllTkKecuw/viewform">Request for Paid Administrative Leave</a> for each employee who needs paid administrative leave.</li>
<li>Managers may designate certain employees to work from home. If employees are designated to work from home, it will be considered paid work status. Employees in positions who are directed not to come to work by the University and are unable to work from home due to the nature of their work (as determined by the manager) should use available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, vacation, PTO-sick, or other accrued leave), and if all available leave balances have been exhausted, the University will provide up to fourteen (14) days paid administrative leave to cover the absence. Supervisors/managers are required to submit a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQrWaOYOE-U7r5BUCV1jGXHMTSC04mCe6MHzrLJllTkKecuw/viewform">Request for Paid Administrative Leave</a> for each employee who needs paid administrative leave. Managers may determine which positions to designate, provided that all healthcare workers are considered exempt from this category of designation.</li>
<li>Academic appointees who do not accrue sick leave but who are eligible for paid medical leave under <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/_files/apm/apm-710.pdf">APM 710&#8211;11</a> or a collective bargaining agreement may request medical leave for their own illness. For other COVID&#8211;19 related absences and for those who have exhausted medical leave options, appointees will receive up to fourteen (14) days paid administrative leave. Requests for medical leave and administrative leave should be directed to the <a href="https://apo.ucsc.edu/about/contacts/div-contacts/index.html">Divisional Academic Personnel Coordinator</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementing these five (5) provisions requires managerial judgment, discretion and flexibility depending on the unit&#8217;s functional priorities and often based on factors present in a specific case.</p>
<p>We encourage all managers and supervisors to think creatively about how to support all employees, including student employees, in caring for their health &#8211; and reducing their risk of exposure to COVID&#8211;19 &#8211; while enabling them to continue performing their important work. Our employees have different jobs and responsibilities and the modifications we can make to their work will vary based on those differences. There will not be one solution that works for or is right for everyone, and some individuals, due to the nature of their work, will be asked to continue to work on site.</p>
<p>In situations where work can temporarily be performed from home or an alternate location, we encourage managers and employees to work together to identify opportunities to allow employees to work remotely. For all employees, especially those whose work cannot easily be done remotely (including hourly, represented, and student workers), managers and employees should work together to develop a remote work plan to complete special assignments, projects, job-related reading or training. In developing a remote work plan, managers should be mindful of employees who may need alternate work stations set up.</p>
<p>Student employees are not eligible for FMLA. However, student employees are eligible for the fourteen (14) days of administrative leave if they cannot work remotely, self isolate or are exhibiting symptoms of the COVID&#8211;19.</p>
<p>Regarding travel, please be conservative in determining travel that is required. It is better to avoid travel than it is to travel. Many UC systemwide meetings are now being canceled or changed to Zoom in order to decrease the need for business travel. Please do not let concerns about non-refundable deposits, etc. lead to travel decisions that put people in more susceptible situations.</p>
<p>Please continue to provide the empathy and patience needed to deal with staff who express concerns. Also, find ways to thank those who have roles requiring them to work onsite. The campus is not closed. We still have people who live on campus, need to deal with facility issues, need to maintain labs and conduct research, and a variety of other duties.</p>
<p>Subject to the needs of the University, managers should consider flexible work arrangements such as having employees work on-site with reduced shifts (fewer hours or fewer days). This can be coupled with remote work assignments for the time not spent on-site.</p>
<p>We appreciate the consideration that has been demonstrated by our community as we continue to work through this unpredictable situation. Campus and UC leaders are continuing to meet daily to think through these issues and are preparing to take the necessary measures to protect the health of our employees.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Children's museums can be a challenging environment for parents who feel the urge to explain the science behind all the novel activities that dazzle youngsters.</p>
<p>Sometimes that impulse goes awry, as when a well-meaning parent offers a detailed explanation that interrupts a youngster's exploration and dampens the fun&#8212;and the learning.</p>
<p>New research suggests that timing is key to supporting children's learning in these environments.</p>
<p>The best way to engage with children is to listen to them, watch what they are doing, and offer explanations as the child is beginning to explore an exhibit&#8212;not before or after, according to a team of researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz; the University of Texas, Austin; and Brown University.</p>
<p>"For parents, it&#8217;s important to be sensitive to the child&#8217;s actions and choose your moment to jump in," said Maureen Callanan, a professor of psychology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Callanan, a specialist in child development, has spent decades observing parent-child interactions at children's museums to better understand how children learn in "informal" learning environments. Children learn both from exploring on their own and from hearing their parents&#8217; explanations, but the latest evidence indicates that learning is enhanced when parents time their offerings with what Callanan calls children's "emerging exploration."</p>
<p>"We did find this very precise pattern," she noted. "It's the Goldilocks moment&#8212;not too early and not too late. Stepping up at just the right moment is key to helping children learn and figure things out."</p>
<p>The results of this NSF-funded research appear in Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, coauthored by Callanan; Cristine Legare, associate professor of psychology at UT-Austin; David Sobel, a professor of cognitive, linguistic, and psychological sciences at Brown University; a team of postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students; and museum partners at the three museums where the research took place: Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose, Thinkery in Austin, TX, and Providence Children's Museum in Rhode Island.&#160;</p>
<p><em><u>A natural laboratory for studying early science learning</u></em></p>
<p>Children's museums are the perfect environment in which to explore the delicate balance between "explaining and exploring," because researchers have access to everyday conversations among families in a setting designed to foster early science learning.</p>
<p>"A lot of Western parents assume we have to teach things to our kids, while a lot of museum staffers think exploring is more important and that parents shouldn't lecture at their kids," said Callanan. "Really, it's neither all exploration or all explanation. It's a combination that best supports children's learning."</p>
<p>Museums, parents, and schools are eager to support children's curiosity and their STEM learning, so understanding how to integrate explaining and exploring can lead to better museum exhibits, more learning in museums and schools, and more productive interactions between parents and children.</p>
<p>"These insights about the give-and-take between parents and children are valuable, and they underscore the benefits of these museum-university collaborations," said Jenni Martin, director of education at the Children's Discovery Museum. "These findings help us do our job better, and the ultimate beneficiaries are children."&#160;</p>
<p>The museum has partnered with Callanan for more than 25 years in the study of how young children learn to reason about cause and effect&#8212;an important element of thinking about science. Previous research has focused on talk&#8212;the kinds of "why" questions children ask, when they pose questions, and how parents explain things. Other research has focused on exploratory play.</p>
<p>"Explaining and exploring are both happening all the time," said Callanan. "Sometimes we make judgments about which one is 'better'&#8212;some people think it&#8217;s better for kids to figure out things for themselves. But that leaves out lots of things that are difficult to learn through hands-on exploring."</p>
<p>Which is why Callanan and her colleagues wanted to investigate what happens when children are playing with objects&#8212;in this case, gear exhibits at the three museums&#8212;and talking with their parents. "We wanted to see if there were patterns of how explaining and exploring work together, and how those patterns might vary across different families," she said. &#160;</p>
<p>Overall, the team found stronger links between exploring and understanding than between explaining and understanding, but the best predictor of understanding was when parents' explanations were linked closely with children's exploring.</p>
<p>"It's an indirect link, but it looks like that's the sequence&#8212;a little exploring, then a little explaining leads to deeper exploring and better understanding," said Callanan.</p>

They are less likely to drop out and more likely to graduate on time.</p>
<p>But unpaid internships aren't an option for students who have to work because of financial need. Undergraduates in the <a href="https://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/index.html">Division of Social Sciences</a> will soon benefit from two programs that will provide paid opportunities to do research, engage in service learning, and mentor their peers.</p>
<p>The first initiative is the "Building Belonging" program, a new five-year effort designed to increase engagement and build a greater sense of belonging through service-learning and research projects. A total of 550 students will participate over the five years, each earning $15/hour for up to 100 hours per quarter. Before the coronavirus outbreak, the pilot program had been slated to begin this spring; the launch is now on hold but faculty are encouraged to <a href="https://santacruzinstitute.ucsc.edu/funding-opp/building-belonging.html">apply for funding</a> to hire up to five students per quarter so they will be ready to go when circumstances allow.</p>
<p>The Social Sciences Division is home to several programs that showcase student research, including <a href="https://sociology.ucsc.edu/about/directory-faculty.php?uid=smckay">Steve McKay</a>'s We Belong survey of immigrants, the <a href="https://rca.ucsc.edu/directors-initiatives/human-rights-lab/index.html">Human Rights Investigations Lab</a>, the <a href="https://blumcenter.ucsc.edu/">Blum Center</a>'s Basic Needs analysis, and others.</p>
<p>"It's great because the students get faculty mentors, they get paid, and faculty get help with their research," said Social Sciences Dean Katharyne Mitchell. "It's a win-win-win."</p>
<p>Faculty can't wait to participate, added Mitchell: "It's an opportunity to pay their students, and it's life-changing for the students. This will bring in students who would otherwise be working at Starbucks."</p>
<p>In Anthropology, Assistant Professor <a href="https://www.pema-lab.com/">Vicky Oelze</a> looks forward to being able to pay undergraduates who code video clips of primates and other wildlife recorded at African field sites, currently only for academic credit. Students play an invaluable role, reviewing hundreds of hours of footage of chimpanzees to identify individuals and their behavior, as well as other flora and fauna. By doing this labor-intensive review and coding of footage, undergraduates free Oelze to do broad-scale analysis.</p>
<p>"The students love it," said Mitchell. "They get really good at it, and Vicky takes two of the best students to the field in Tanzania in the summer. These opportunities can be a springboard to deeper research."</p>
<p>The Helen and Will Webster Foundation has funded the pilot program, with a commitment to fund a subsequent five-year effort. Mitchell approached Alec and Claudia Webster with the proposal, because she knows they support Chancellor Cindy Larive's commitment to enhancing student success.</p>
<p>"The data are very clear that this kind of mentoring relationship with students aids in the retention of all students, particularly first-generation and underrepresented students," said Mitchell. "It provides a sense of belonging."</p>
<p>When the program launches, 50 students will make up the inaugural cohort, followed by 100 students per year thereafter. Annual assessments, including student surveys, will provide opportunities to "fine tune" the program, which will be administered by the <a href="https://santacruzinstitute.ucsc.edu/">Institute for Social Transformation</a>. An annual research symposium will give students a chance to present their work alongside their faculty mentors, and an evaluation at the end will compare educational outcomes of participants with similar students who were not involved.</p>
<p>"Evaluation is very important, because we want this to work over the long term, and we want to develop a model that can be implemented in other divisions and on other campuses," said Mitchell.&#160;</p>
<p><em><u>Lead Peer Advising Program</u></em></p>
<p>The second initiative is a five-year extension of the division's successful Lead Peer Advising Program, which began as a pilot program two years ago. This program, which pays undergraduates to provide academic advising to students in their major, will meet two critical needs simultaneously: It will ease the campus shortage of academic advisors while offering students an attractive paid, on-campus professional development opportunity.</p>
<p>Prior to this expansion, professional undergraduate advisers trained students, who received pay and academic credit, but they could only earn credit for one quarter. "Students mentored their peers, helping get them through the major," said Mitchell. "Then, just as they were getting really good at their mentoring skills, they had to stop, because they couldn&#8217;t receive any more credits. Now they can shift into paid positions, which has the added advantage of freeing up the professional advisors from having to train new students every quarter."</p>
<p>The Helen and Will Webster Foundation provided the funding for the initial pilot program, as well as the new five-year expansion. With the infusion of new support, each department will be eligible to employ two lead peer mentors per quarter, according to Mitchell.</p>
<p>"We agree with the chancellor's vision for undergraduate student success, and we asked ourselves what would help us realize those goals," said Mitchell. "In the social sciences, close relationships with faculty and good advising are two key factors. These programs are exactly what I felt would be most beneficial for the success of our students and I am delighted that this generous gift has enabled us to follow through on this vision."</p>

Now researchers have worked out the details of IL-2&#8217;s complex interactions with receptor molecules on immune cells, providing a blueprint for the development of more targeted therapies for treating cancer or autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>IL-2 acts as a growth factor to stimulate the expansion of T cell populations during an immune response. Different types of T cells play different roles, and IL-2 can stimulate both effector T cells, which lead the immune system&#8217;s attack on specific antigens, and regulatory T cells, which serve to rein in the immune system after the threat is gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;IL-2 can act as either a throttle or a brake on the immune response in different contexts,&#8221; said Nikolaos Sgourakis, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Our investigation used detailed biophysical methods to show how it does this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sgourakis is a corresponding author of the new study, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/03/16/2000419117">published March 17 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>. First author Viviane De Paula, a visiting scientist in his lab from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) to observe IL-2&#8217;s structural dynamics. The study was done in close collaboration with corresponding author Christopher Garcia&#8217;s group at Stanford University.</p>
<p>The researchers were able to show that IL-2 adopts two different structural forms (termed conformations) that affect how it interacts with the receptors on different types of T cells. In solution, IL-2 naturally shifts back and forth between a minor conformation and a major conformation. The study also showed how certain mutations or interactions with other molecules can bias IL-2 toward adopting one conformation or the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have now come one step closer to a detailed understanding of how the IL-2 cytokine works,&#8221; de Paula said. &#8220;It is the first time that anyone has managed to observe a transient state of IL-2 directly. With the use of NMR, we were able to describe the structure, dynamics, and function of IL-2 in its two conformations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study opens up numerous possibilities for designing drugs to stabilize IL-2 in a particular conformation for therapeutic applications.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can use this information to tweak the balance, depending on what we want to achieve in a clinical setting,&#8221; Sgourakis said. &#8220;To target regulatory T cells, we would want to stabilize the minor conformation, and to target effector T cells, we would want to stabilize the major conformation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Previous efforts by other researchers had already shown that different monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-2 could promote the expansion of different T cell populations in mice. One of these antibodies in complex with IL-2 was effective in treating mouse models of autoimmune disease and inflammation. And a similar human monoclonal antibody is currently heading toward clinical trials for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>The new study provides a mechanistic explanation for these effects that can guide further drug discovery efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;The details of the mechanism we present offer a direct blueprint for drug discovery,&#8221; said Garcia. &#8220;Every drug company wants to know how to engineer this cytokine, and this paper provides some of the first really bona fide structural clarity on the fascinating topic of IL-2 dynamics.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to De Paula, Garcia, and Sgourakis, the coauthors include Kevin Jude and Caleb Glassman at Stanford and Santrupti Nerli at UC Santa Cruz.

<p>A paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2126-y">published March 18 in <em>Nature</em></a> (together with a companion data paper in the journal <em>Scientific Data</em>) describes a novel solution to this problem, using electronic tracking data from birds and marine mammals.</p>
<p>&#8220;We identified common areas used by multiple species, which allowed us for the first time to evaluate how well Marine Protected Areas are serving the entire community of species in the Southern Ocean,&#8221; said coauthor Luis Huckstadt, an assistant researcher in the Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS) at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Animals go to places where they find food, so identifying areas of the Southern Ocean where predators most commonly go reveals where their prey can be found. For example, humpback whales and penguins will go to places where they can feed on krill, whereas elephant seals and albatrosses go where they can find fish, squid, or other prey. If all these predators and their diverse prey are found in the same place, then this area has both high diversity and abundance of species, indicating that it is of high ecological significance.</p>
<p>The project was coordinated by the <a href="https://scar.org/"><span>Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research</span></a> (SCAR), with support from the Center for the Synthesis and Analysis of Biodiversity (CESAB) in France and the World Wildlife Fund&#8211;UK.</p>
<p>As members of SCAR&#8217;s <a href="https://scar.org/science/eg-bamm/home/"><span>Expert Group on Birds and Marine Mammals</span></a>, Huckstadt and coauthor Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of the IMS, were part of the core team that planned and carried out the study, engaging with an extensive network of Antarctic researchers to assemble existing Southern Ocean predator tracking data.</p>
<p>Costa and Huckstadt contributed their own tracking data from their studies of Weddell seals, crabeater seals, and Southern elephant seals, and coauthor and IMS researcher Ari Friedlaender contributed data on humpback whales. Co-first author Ryan Reisinger played a principal analytical role in the study while a researcher at CESAB in France, and is currently a postdoctoral researcher in Friedlaender&#8217;s lab at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>After careful validation of the predator tracking data, the combined result was an enormous database of over 4,000 individual animal tracks from 17 species, collected by more than 70 scientists across 12 national Antarctic programs. This database is now available for public download.</p>
<p>Even this impressive database does not directly represent all Southern Ocean predator activity, because it is impossible to track every species from all their breeding colonies. Simple mapping would therefore provide a biased representation of animal distribution. To overcome this, sophisticated statistical models were used to predict the at-sea movements for all known colonies of each predator species across the entire Southern Ocean. These predictions were combined across the 17 predator species to provide an integrated map of those areas used by many different predators with diverse prey requirements.</p>
<p>The most important of these areas&#8212;called &#8220;areas of ecological significance&#8221;&#8212;are scattered around the Antarctic continental shelf and in two wider oceanic regions, one projecting from the Antarctic Peninsula across the Scotia Sea, and another surrounding the sub-Antarctic islands in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean.</p>
<p>Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are a crucial tool in the conservation management toolbox. Existing and proposed MPAs in the Southern Ocean are mostly found within the areas of ecological significance, suggesting that they are currently in the right places. Yet when using climate model projections to account for how areas of important habitat may shift by 2100, the study found that existing MPAs with their fixed boundaries may not remain aligned with future important habitats.</p>
<p>&#8220;The existing and proposed MPAs do a remarkable job of protecting these regions,&#8221; Costa said. &#8220;While the habitats will shift with climate change, a substantial amount is likely to remain within protected regions.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the authors, dynamic management of MPAs, updated over time in response to ongoing change, will be needed to ensure continued protection of Southern Ocean ecosystems and their resources in the face of growing resource demand by current and future generations.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d5d34f5880727017465cacce9741c15b"><name>chancellor-remote-instruction-spring</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC to adopt remote instruction for duration of the spring quarter</title><summary>I write today to announce that the suspension of in-person instruction, lectures and discussion sections is now extended to the full spring quarter.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I last wrote to you on Tuesday, additional information has emerged about the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its rapid spread. It is a crisis of enormous scale and human impact, the likes of which we have not seen in our lifetimes. We made this difficult decision to extend remote instruction following consultation with campus leadership, the Academic Senate, and the UC Office of the President. It is intended to better protect the safety of all members of the UCSC community by enhancing the ability to practice social distancing.</span></p>
<p><strong>This does not mean campus is closing for spring quarter</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><strong>Campus will remain open.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Most support services for students, including counseling, advising, and tutoring, will be delivered via Zoom. Over the next two weeks, departments and instructors will evaluate the extent to which laboratory and studio courses can be offered in person with appropriate social distancing or whether they can transition to remote instruction. Additional guidance will be provided about these courses by March 20, and no in-person laboratory or studio courses will meet prior to April 6.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students who have already left campus housing or plan to do so should remain at their permanent residence through the spring quarter, if possible. Students who intend to remain in campus housing for the spring quarter are strongly encouraged to remain on campus and not travel over spring break. Student housing, dining, health services, the library, and research support operations will remain open, although there will be changes in most operations and services.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Should you wish to cancel your housing for the entire spring quarter, you can complete the online Intent to Vacate form. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(A link to the form will be emailed to residential students soon)</span><strong>.</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you remove all of your belongings from your housing and return your key by April 5, you will be eligible for a full refund of any housing and dining fees paid for spring quarter. For any student moving out after April 5, charges will be prorated based on the date the room is vacated and the checkout process is completed. Students cancelling and moving out will not be assessed the standard cancellation fee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New details about this virus are emerging constantly, and we are updating our campus </span><a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/coronavirus/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVD-19 website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regularly. The site includes sections on Health Services, Instruction, Campus Operations, Telecommuting, Events, Student Services, Travel, and International Studies. Please use the site as a resource about the virus and how to protect yourself against it. It is also where you will find all of the latest information on how our campus is responding to the outbreak. The UC Office of the President&#8217;s</span><a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 webpage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also a good resource.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know the measures we have taken are difficult, especially for students. I regret that this period in your lives is being filled with so much uncertainty. Our highest priority must be to keep everyone on our campus safe.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To our faculty and staff, I thank you for your flexibility and willingness to roll up your sleeves as we do our best for our students. You are doing extremely valuable work while undoubtedly also experiencing your own anxiety. Though we do not yet have a confirmed case of COVID-19 on our campus, there are currently seven confirmed cases in the county, and it was announced last night that all Santa Cruz County public schools will shut down next week, March 16-20. I understand the stress this puts on many of you.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, I am confident that together we will reach the other side of this upheaval, and I look forward to the time when our community will again be able to come together in person. The preventative measures being taken by universities, by cities and counties, and by the business community are critical to successfully confronting this health emergency. Our best course of action is to undertake aggressive public measures to slow the spread of the virus. The steps we are taking at UCSC are intended to do just that.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d64d161280727017465cacce5499eacc"><name>covid-19-operational-changes-extending-into-spring-quarter</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>COVID-19 operational changes extending into spring quarter</title><summary>As outlined earlier today by Chancellor Larive, remote instruction for lecture and discussion sections, originally announced through April 3, will extend for the entire spring quarter.</summary><start-date>1584082860000</start-date><display-name>COVID-19 operational changes extending into spring quarter</display-name><path>/2020/03/covid-19-operational-changes-extending-into-spring-quarter</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/03/covid-19-operational-changes-extending-into-spring-quarter</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1584143340993</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594750149198</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><span>As </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/03/chancellor-remote-instruction-spring.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584227278181000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEpJq77ZxgxAIWVo_dXf6b4PMjfoQ" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/03/chancellor-remote-instruction-spring.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>outlined earlier today</span></a><span> by Chancellor Larive, remote instruction for lecture and discussion sections, originally announced through April 3, will extend for the entire spring quarter.</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">We continue to be proactive in our efforts to promote higher levels of sanitation in heavily trafficked and public areas across campus. It remains vital that everyone on campus assist by taking several actions, such as social distancing when possible; thorough hand washing to prevent the spread of disease; avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth; refraining from shaking hands; washing hands thoroughly before and after traveling from place to place; and cleaning work surfaces in personal work stations.&#160;&#160;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><span>Managers and supervisors should continue to implement temporary remote work arrangements to the greatest extent possible. For positions where remote work is not possible, managers and supervisors should work with staff to ensure they have guidance on how to deal with personal health or issues arising from an illness in their family.

<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">We are extending previously communicated guidance on travel. The following adjustments will now apply to travel taking place through the end of the spring quarter. Should conditions warrant it, we might lift these restrictions prior to that date.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">All nonessential business-related staff and faculty travel scheduled to take place in spring quarter should be canceled. The determination of essential will be up to the principal officer overseeing the unit.</span></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Those who oversee university-sponsored student trips and programs should assess if changes should be made to travel plans and if cancellation is appropriate based on the logistics of the trip, mode of travel, and the destination. Individuals should consult their principal officers as needed in assessing changes.</span></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">On-campus Housing</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">In the chancellor&#8217;s message, she communicated that students who have already left campus housing or plan to do so should remain at their permanent residence through spring quarter, if possible. Students who intend to remain in campus housing for the spring quarter are strongly encouraged to remain on campus and not travel over spring break. Students will receive relief from their campus housing and dining fees, if applicable, if they decide to move out of campus housing. Specifics on refunds and applicable dates were communicated in Chancellor Larive&#8217;s message. Students who wish to move out of campus housing for the entire spring quarter must complete the online Intent to Vacate form, which is being sent out to residents shortly.&#160;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">For those remaining on campus, dining options will be available, though some services might be adapted or limited as conditions change.</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">For all events scheduled to take place through the end of April, the following should apply:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><span>Postpone or cancel events with an anticipated in-person attendance of more than 50. This number is consistent with</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.santacruzhealth.org/Portals/7/Pdfs/Coronavirus/3-9-20%2520Interim%2520Social%2520Distancing%2520Guidance%2520Final.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584227278182000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE1R02fahGdzBDKQ0rRQV1iJRS98Q" href="https://www.santacruzhealth.org/Portals/7/Pdfs/Coronavirus/3-9-20%20Interim%20Social%20Distancing%20Guidance%20Final.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span> </span><span>guidance from the Santa Cruz County Health Department</span></a><span>. This includes events where the university is providing space to an outside host as well as university hosted events on off-campus locations.</span></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">For campus-sponsored events with fewer than 50 attendees, we strongly encourage planners of those events to explore alternatives to in-person gatherings.</span></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Campus tours, yield events, and other visitor programs should be postponed or canceled and sponsors should consider offering online or virtual campus outreach where feasible and appropriate for program outcomes.</span></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Arts performances and lectures where social distancing is not possible and/or where attendees are likely to travel from other regions of the state, country or globe should be canceled.&#160;</span></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Performances and lectures that are tied to instruction and/or final exams should follow the guidance provided in the earlier messages from the Chancellor and interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer.</span></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Though the above guidance applies to already scheduled events taking place prior to the end of April, sponsors should review all events currently scheduled in spring quarter to assess whether additional postponements or cancelations are necessary. Individuals with questions about contracts for currently scheduled events can contact the Office of Campus Counsel for guidance.&#160;</span></span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">In addition, units should cease booking any new campus events scheduled to take place during spring quarter where event characteristics match those outlined above. This restriction could be lifted if conditions warrant.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Discussions on how to manage commencement are underway and will be communicated soon.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Campus meetings</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Where possible, campus departments are strongly advised to utilize Zoom (or alternative services) for meetings to reduce travel within the campus or between campus locations. For in-person meetings, social distancing practices should be followed. The guidance above related to gatherings involving more than 50 participants should also be used when making determinations about meeting alterations and cancellations.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Research business continuity</span></strong></p>

One primary consideration for principal officers remains the need to ensure that PIs have updated their continuity plans to deal with research needs, such as dealing with sensitive materials in labs that require oversight, in the event the PI becomes ill or the campus has to further curtail operations.&#160;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Our campus emergency response team continues to work with units across campus to ensure our response is robust and we are able to support the health and safety of our campus community.

<p>The policy describes the responsibilities of the University, its campuses, and researchers, in protecting the rights and welfare of human subjects who participate in research at UC.</p>
<p>The policy includes the following key revisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>An explanation of the ethical principles that the University follows for human subjects research.</li>
<li>A statement that the University&#8217;s commitment to human subjects applies to all human subjects research in which the University is engaged, regardless of funding source or the institution that provided the IRB review.</li>
<li>An explanation that campuses may replace specific Common Rule requirements with commensurate protections for human subjects when the University is engaged in research that is not subject to the Common Rule (e.g., research that is not federally-funded or otherwise subject to federal oversight).</li>
<li>A description of the responsibilities of the campuses, IRBs, other oversight offices and committees, and researchers for compliance with this policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The proposed policy is <a href="https://policy.ucsc.edu/policies/policiesinreview/uc_human_subjects.pdf">available online</a>.</p>

<p>Dining Services continues to closely monitor the rapidly evolving COVID&#8211;19 situation. Given today&#8217;s declaration by Gov. Gavin Newsom regarding limitations of restaurant seating and expansion of social distancing we have made shifts to our operation delivery plan for the week of March 16&#8211;20, 2020 in an effort to keep our patrons safely fed.</p>
<p>Starting Monday, March 16th, several operational changes will be in effect. <strong>The following facilities will all maintain their normal operating schedules, barring unforeseen shortages in staffing availability, but will be implementing changes to delivery as outlined below.</strong> Please regularly check the <a href="https://dining.ucsc.edu">UCSC Dining website</a> for updates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cowell Dining Hall</li>
<li>Colleges 9/10 Dining Hall</li>
<li>Rachel Carson Dining Hall</li>
<li>PERK at Baskin Engineering</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>At this time all other Dining Hall and Dining Retail locations are expected to remain closed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Crown and Porter Dining Halls</li>
<li>Stevenson Coffee House</li>
<li>Oakes Cafe</li>
<li>College Eight Cafe</li>
<li>Banana Joe&#8217;s</li>
<li>Terra Fresca Fresca Restaurant and Coffee Bar</li>
<li>PERK Carts at Earth and Marine Sciences (EMS) and the Physical Sciences Building (PSB)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s shifting with how patrons may get their meals?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All meals must be taken &#8220;to go&#8221; from the Dining facility.</li>
<li>No more than 50 patrons will be permitted to enter the facility at one time.</li>
<li>You are encouraged to maintain a 6-foot social distance radius from the next person waiting in line so as to minimize any unnecessary exposure.</li>
<li>Upon entry you are encouraged to sign up for the Eco Box program which allows you to use and return your box to be washed for reuse by another patron in the dining hall. No fee will be assessed for utilizing this program. Compostable &#8220;To go&#8221; boxes will be made available for all others.</li>
<li>Patrons on a 5- and 7-day meal plan will not be limited to the number of to go or eco box meals they may take per day, but consideration for those who may be waiting in lines is appreciated.</li>
<li>Food handler gloves will be provided upon entrance and all patrons are encouraged to wear them at the self-service stations (deli, salad and dessert bars).</li>
<li>Dining Services staff will continue to be proactive in promoting the highest levels of sanitation in heavily trafficked and public areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>As staffing levels or other precautions necessitate, Dining may need to continue to adjust the dining operations program and schedule throughout the week. Please stay informed of additional operational changes by checking the <a href="https://dining.ucsc.edu">UCSC Dining website</a>.</p>

Casey was born in Los Angeles in 1945 and grew up in Escondido. He graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 1968 and got his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1971. He joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz as an acting assistant professor in 1970 and wrote his thesis while teaching his first year of classes.<br/><br/>Casey&#8217;s early research involved extensive field work in Alaska, where he pioneered field observations of uplifted sedimentary rocks that were deformed in subduction zones. He later pioneered the study of scientific drilling into active accretionary prisms at the front of subduction zones, and he made some of the first observations using the submersible ALVIN of cold seeps with chemosynthetic biological communities living at the surface of such prisms. That work provided his long-time focus on the role of fluids in subduction zones and their effects on earthquake generation. These studies have formed the basis for a whole generation of forefront science being carried out by the marine geological and geophysical communities.<br/><br/>Casey played a key role in the justification for the Japanese to build a massive drill ship capable of drilling deep into subduction zones and into the region of earthquake generation along the slip surface of subduction zones, and he participated as a co-chief scientist on several of those expeditions. As a tribute to Casey for this effort, he was awarded the International Prize from the Geological Society of Japan in 2011. Other awards include the Shepard Medal for Excellence in Marine Geology (2013), and Fellowship in the Geological Society of America (1984) and the American Geophysical Union (2013).<br/><br/>Casey&#8217;s work always involved an active and committed group of graduate students and post-docs. He could often be seen in the lab working one-on-one with a student, and his good-natured laughter usually permeated the hallways. His former students and post-docs now make up a significant number of the researchers and faculty carrying out subduction zone research across the country, including those in charge of major programs. The success of his mentees has been legendary, and they continue to infuse the field with the same excitement and enthusiasm that Casey showed throughout his career. He was a joy to have as a colleague, and his presence never failed to bring a smile to the faces of anyone who came into contact with him. Though not one to take on a lot of administrative jobs, Casey was in many ways the heart and soul of the department.<br/><br/>Casey is survived by his wife Hilde Schwartz, his children Jay Moore and Allison Aguilar (Armando), his step-daughter Maya Wildgoose (Alex), his grandchildren Alex, Andrew, Katie and Khloe, his great grandchildren Brayden and Brody, his sister-in-law Heide Schwartz, and his brother Patrick.</p>

According to a new study, however, one widely used algorithmic approach for modeling these networks is fundamentally flawed, failing to capture important properties of real-world complex networks.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that these techniques are giving you absolute garbage. They probably have some information in them, but not as much information as many people believe,&#8221; said C. &#8220;Sesh&#8221; Seshadhri, associate professor of computer science and engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Seshadhri is first author of a paper on the new findings <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/02/26/1911030117">published March 2 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>. The study evaluated techniques known as &#8220;low-dimensional embeddings,&#8221; which are commonly used as input to machine learning models. This is an active area of research, with new embedding methods being developed at a rapid pace. But Seshadhri and his coauthors say all these methods share the same shortcomings.</p>
<p><strong>Social networks</strong></p>
<p>To explain why, Seshadhri used the example of a social network, a familiar type of complex network. Many companies apply machine learning to social network data to generate predictions about people&#8217;s behavior, recommendations for users, and so on. Embedding techniques essentially convert a person&#8217;s position in a social network into a set of coordinates for a point in a geometric space, yielding a list of numbers for each person that can be plugged into an algorithm.</p>
<p>&#8220;That's important because something abstract like a persons 'position in a social network' can be converted to a concrete list of numbers. Another important thing is that you want to convert this into a low-dimensional space, so that the list of numbers representing each person is relatively small,&#8221; Seshadhri explained.</p>
<p>Once this conversion has been done, the system ignores the actual social network and makes predictions based on the relationships between points in space. For example, if a lot of people close to you in that space are buying a particular product, the system might predict that you are likely to buy the same product.</p>
<p>Seshadhri and his coauthors demonstrated mathematically that significant structural aspects of complex networks are lost in this embedding process. They also confirmed this result by empirically by testing various embedding techniques on different kinds of complex networks.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not saying that certain specific methods fail. We&#8217;re saying that any embedding method that gives you a small list of numbers is fundamentally going to fail, because a low-dimensional geometry is just not expressive enough for social networks and other complex networks,&#8221; Seshadhri said.</p>
<p><strong>Triangle density</strong></p>
<p>A crucial feature of real-world social networks is the density of triangles, or connections between three people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where you have lots of triangles, it means there is a lot of community structure in that part of a social network,&#8221; Seshadhri said. &#8220;Moreover, these triangles are even more significant when you&#8217;re looking at people who have limited social networks. In a typical social network, some people have tons of connections, but most people don&#8217;t have a lot of connections.&#8221;</p>
<p>In their analysis of embedding techniques, the researchers observed that a lot of the social triangles representing community structure are lost in the embedding process. &#8220;All of this information seems to disappear, so it&#8217;s almost like the very thing you wanted to find has been lost when you construct these geometric representations,&#8221; Seshadhri said.</p>
<p>Low-dimensional embeddings are by no means the only methods being used to generate predictions and recommendations. They are typically just one of many inputs into a very large and complex machine learning model.</p>
<p>&#8220;This model is a huge black box, and a lot of the positive results being reported say that if you include these low-dimensional embeddings, your performance goes up, maybe you get a slight bump. But if you used it by itself, it seems you would be missing a lot,&#8221; Seshadhri said.</p>
<p>He also noted that new embedding methods are mostly being compared to other embedding methods. Recent empirical work by other researchers, however, shows that different techniques can give better results for specific tasks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s say you want to predict who&#8217;s a Republican and who&#8217;s a Democrat. There are techniques developed specifically for that task which work better than embeddings,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The claim is that these embedding techniques work for many different tasks, and that&#8217;s why a lot of people have adopted them. It&#8217;s also very easy to plug them into an existing machine learning system. But for any particular task, it turns out there is always something better you can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given the growing influence of machine learning in our society, Seshadhri said it is important to investigate whether the underlying assumptions behind the models are valid.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have all these complicated machines doing things that affect our lives significantly. Our message is just that we need to be more careful about evaluating these techniques,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Especially in this day and age when machine learning is getting more and more complicated, it&#8217;s important to have some understanding of what can and cannot be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Seshadhri, the coauthors of the paper include Aneesh Sharma at Google, UCSC graduate student Andrew Stolman, and Ashish Goel at Stanford University.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It needed to look like Northern California &#8212; sort of Silicon Valley-ish &#8212; and it needed to say science and tech. UC Santa Cruz was the right place at the right time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The brutalist architecture among the redwoods was perfect for us,&#8221; said Alex Garland, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Devs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> writer, director, and co-executive producer, when he returned to campus March 6 to premiere the first episode and discuss the making of the eight-part FX Productions series.&#160; <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filming took place at McHenry Library,&#160; Quarry Amphitheater, Science Hill and other locations across campus over several weeks in late August and September 2018. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;&#8220;It is an extraordinary campus,&#8221; said Allon Reich of the London-based production house DNA TV and co-executive producer.&#160; Reich said he and Garland loved the look of McHenry Library and many of the scenes take place there. <br/></span></p>
<p><strong>Hero of the hero</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filmmakers call the key location of a production the &#8220;hero location.&#8221; The UCSC campus is the hero location for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Devs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and McHenry Library is the &#8220;hero of the hero,&#8221; Reich said. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After screening the first episode at the College 9/10 multipurpose room, Reich and his producing partner, Andrew Macdonald, joined Garland in a discussion with Soraya Murray, associate professor of film and digital media. All three noted UCSC&#8217;s distinctive and varied architecture and how it fit just right for their TV series. <br/></span></p>
<p><strong>A mysterious disappearance<br/></strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Devs </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">focuses on a young software engineer, Lily Chan, played by Sonoya Mizuno, as she investigates the secret development division of Amaya, a quantum computing company where she works, which she believes is behind the disappearance of her boyfriend the day he began working in Amaya&#8217;s &#8220;Devs&#8221; division.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amaya is run by a bearded and flannel shirt wearing CEO named Forest played by Nick Offerman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was never a guarantee that a California location would be used for the Amaya campus. Locations in Europe and Canada were considered, said the location manager, Simon Lake, who happens to have graduated from Stevenson College in 2006 with a degree in anthropology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco figures prominently in the story, too, and filming had to take place there but &#8220;whether we found the campus in this country was up in the air,&#8221; Lake said. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After getting a general idea of what the producers were looking for, Lake started researching what tech campuses look like. He checked out some Silicon Valley companies, which weren&#8217;t quite right, and then considered institutions like UC Berkeley, San Francisco State and Ca&#241;ada College. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Being a UCSC alumn, I asked them a silly question,&#8221; he said, &#8220;&#8216;would you consider basing it in Santa Cruz?&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Photographing favorite architecture</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer was yes and &#8220;I went down and started photographing my favorite architecture on campus,&#8221; recalled Lake, who lives in Berkeley. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All the different pieces of campus, that&#8217;s what made it work, new architecture, old architecture. Locations are kind of a character, at least a background,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With Santa Cruz, I think the brutalist architecture lends some gravitas to the company.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;Brutalism, favored in the 1950s and &#8216;60s, is typified by simple, block-like structures that often feature exposed concrete. The first iteration of McHenry Library, the original field house,&#160; and the first science buildings are classic examples.&#160; <br/></span></p>
<p><strong>Science at the story's heart</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Science is at the heart of this thing,&#8221; Garland said during the discussion with Murray. He said his idea for the series came from his love of science and a theory that by coupling the philosophy of determinism with massive computing power one could predict the behavior of all lifeforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garland, Reich, and Macdonald are English and previously worked together on the sci-fi films&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ex Machina</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annihilation,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which Garland wrote and directed. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ex Machina</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was nominated for an Academy Award for best original screenplay in 2016.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Filming took place during intersession when campus is relatively quiet. The production team that numbered more than 100 at times was based in the east remote parking lot which gave them easy access to McHenry Library and the Quarry.&#160;</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first episode, soaring aerial shots show the redwood-covered campus at its most scenic, with the odd juxtaposition of a giant statue of a little girl peeking over the treetops.&#160; The statue stands in the Quarry Amphitheater and is of Forest&#8217;s daughter Amaya who died as a child. The significance develops in later episodes. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several UCSC students and alums worked on the production. One, Yin Wu (Cowell, 2018, film and digital media) began as a production assistant during the campus shooting and stayed on for a week of filming in San Francisco. <br/></span></p>
<p><strong>'It was a blast'</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was a blast,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I learned more about the production aspect of filmmaking during those two months than I have in my entire career as a film student,&#8221; he said, and credited director Garland with making a &#8220;perfect first-time-on-set experience.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wu also discovered a career path. He has since returned home to China and is about to start an internship at a video effects company in Beijing. He said a Devs crew member connected him with the Devs VFX supervisor after seeing his photography and thought he might be interested in the field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back on the production nearly two years after he first started working on it, Lake, the Stevenson grad who was location manager, credited Garland, Reich, and Macdonald as being a &#8220;treat to work with.&#8221; <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UCSC is not the easiest place to work,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It helps when you work with a very smart guy, especially when he&#8217;s the writer and director.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, what really sealed the deal were the redwoods, Lake said, and they figure prominently in many scenes. &#8220;Really it was the trees that they fell in love with,&#8221; he said, &#8220;paths through the trees, bridges through the trees. Pretty spectacular.&#8221;</span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/devs</url><title>'Devs' — FX on Hulu</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e49ef2fd80727017465caccef57d97f9"><name>spring-2020-intent-to-vacate-express-checkout-process</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Spring 2020 Intent to Vacate / Express Checkout Process</title><summary>As outlined earlier today by Chancellor Larive, remote instruction for lecture and discussion sections, originally announced through April 3, will extend for the entire spring quarter.</summary><start-date>1584083100000</start-date><display-name>Spring 2020 Intent to Vacate / Express Checkout Process</display-name><path>/2020/03/spring-2020-intent-to-vacate-express-checkout-process</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/03/spring-2020-intent-to-vacate-express-checkout-process</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1584383587035</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594750201286</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p align="left">Dear Resident,</p>

Additional cases were confirmed in Santa Cruz (7) and Santa Clara (more than 65) counties. One of the Santa Cruz cases involves an employee at Rio Del Mar Elementary School. County health officials are investigating all cases, and school and airport authorities are taking actions for prevention.</p>
<p>As we learn of more cases in our community, it is natural for everyone to feel concerned about potential exposure to someone with COVID&#8211;19, and it&#8217;s sensible to take precautions.</p>
<p>We write to offer guidance for when you hear from staff who are concerned about exposure to COVID&#8211;19, who are being tested for COVID&#8211;19, and/or who may have a confirmed case of COVID&#8211;19 in their close community of relatives and friends. Often when these reports are made, they come with great expectations for managers to immediately do something - for example, close an office, notify a community/department or other cohort, request that everyone be tested and so on. It is critical that as campus leaders, we take pause to act efficiently and methodically, so as not to make a misstep. The information below is designed to help managers assess the situation and identify steps to take.</p>
<p>As a first step, managers need to remember that medical information about individuals is protected under HIPAA and student information is protected under HIPAA and FERPA. It&#8217;s critical that information be held in confidence and that disclosures of protected information are managed within federal and University policy. We remind you to take great care to avoid unnecessarily disclosing anyone&#8217;s medical condition or other private information.</p>
<h3>What to do if:</h3>

<h3>SCENARIOS:</h3>
<p><strong>Q. An employee came to work while they were sick. This event raised concerns by members of the department. Should I direct the office to work remotely?</strong></p>
<p>If it was observed that the ill colleague was showing signs of fever, cough or shortness of breath, then managers may designate certain employees to work from home. If employees are designated to work from home, it will be considered paid work status. Employees in positions who are directed not to come to work by the University and are unable to work from home due to the nature of their work (as determined by the manager) should use available leave balances (e.g. sick leave, vacation, PTO-sick, or other accrued leave), and if all available leave balances have been exhausted, the University will provide up to fourteen (14) days paid administrative leave to cover the absence. Supervisors/managers are required to submit a Request for Paid Administrative Leave for each employee who needs paid administrative leave. Managers may determine which positions to designate to work from home; however, all healthcare workers are considered exempt from this category of designation.</p>
<p><strong>An employee, their child or a member of their household had an interaction with someone who is now showing signs of COVID&#8211;19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath). How shall I respond?</strong></p>
<p>Unless the person has a confirmed case of COVID&#8211;19, no action is needed.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Managers and Supervisors</audience><admin>Grace McClintock, AVP, Academic Personnel Office; Steve Stein, AVC, Staff Human Resources; and Lisa Ehret, Director of Emergency Management</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e5472035807270175680b368a0f43e41"><name>all-remote-instruction-for-spring-quarter-and-changes-in-library-hours</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>ALL remote instruction for spring quarter and changes in library hours</title><summary>I write today to announce that the suspension of in-person instruction, lectures and discussion sections, extended to the full spring quarter, will include all labs, studios, field research, and field study courses.</summary><start-date>1584342120000</start-date><display-name>ALL remote instruction for spring quarter and changes in library hours</display-name><path>/2020/03/all-remote-instruction-for-spring-quarter-and-changes-in-library-hours</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/03/all-remote-instruction-for-spring-quarter-and-changes-in-library-hours</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1584394608303</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594750638924</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><strong>I write today to announce that the suspension of in-person instruction, lectures and discussion sections, extended to the full spring quarter, will include all labs, studios, field research, and field study courses.

He had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2012 but never gave up hope of defeating it. As an astronomer at Lick Observatory, Lloyd Robinson made crucial contributions to creating the University of California Observatories (UCO) as we know it today.<br/><br/>Observatories succeed or fail by their technical prowess. Robinson sparked a renaissance in technical capabilities at Lick Observatory during the 1970s and 80s that enabled UC astronomers to enjoy observing capabilities at Lick that matched, and in some cases surpassed, those of its long-time rival, Palomar Observatory, despite the latter&#8217;s larger telescopes and darker skies. Those capabilities in turn laid the foundation, and built the confidence, that was necessary for Lick to take over leadership of the Keck Telescope project and its world-leading instrumentation, which again led the astronomical world through most of the 2000s.<br/><br/>Lloyd Robinson was born in Gravelbourg, Saskatchewan, Canada, on August 28, 1929, and the farm life he enjoyed during his early years was always in his blood. Unfortunately, his parents were badly affected by the Great Depression and soon lost their farm, eventually moving to North Battleford. However, the love of growing fruit and vegetables was instilled in Robinson in his formative years and remained with him for the rest of his life. Another of his loves was the violin, which he learned to play as a young child and enjoyed playing right to the end.<br/><br/>Robinson was a brilliant student, but after high school he couldn&#8217;t afford to go to university. He took a position with the Dominion Fruit Company, where he worked in the accounting office, but soon recognized the need to further his education. In 1949, he enrolled at the University of Saskatchewan, where he earned his B.A. degree with great distinction in 1952, followed by his M.A. degree in 1954. He earned his Ph.D. in physics at the University of British Columbia in 1957.<br/><br/>During this time, Robinson married Norma Dyck (in 1952), and their son Barton was born three years later. His daughter, Margo, was born in 1958.<br/><br/>After graduate school, Robinson accepted a position with Atomic Energy of Canada&#8217;s Chalk River Nuclear Research Facility in Deep River, Ontario, where he worked closely with researcher Fred Goulding. After Goulding moved to UC&#8217;s Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL), he encouraged Robinson to join him there. In 1962, Robinson accepted a position at LBL, and he and his family moved to Walnut Creek.<br/><br/>In 1969, Lick Astronomer Joseph Wampler was working to update the observing facilities at the UC&#8217;s Lick Observatory. Wampler felt strongly that the observatory needed a physicist who was also highly skilled in computer design and programming. Wampler&#8217;s close connection with LBL enabled the observatory to recruit Robinson, who had matured by then into a gifted instrumental physicist and skilled computer engineer and programmer.<br/><br/>One of Robinson&#8217;s first tasks was to team with Wampler to mount two NASA gigawatt ruby lasers on the Shane telescope in order to measure the distance to the moon. The lasers were fired at the newly installed retroreflector array placed there by Apollo 11 astronauts, and the first measured time delay, on August 1, 1969, gave the distance to the moon with unprecedented centimeter accuracy, laying the foundation for continued monitoring of the moon&#8217;s orbit which continues to this day using this technique.<br/><br/>Shortly after this success, Robinson worked with Wampler and others to develop a novel scanner that combined image tubes, electronic readout, and computer control to produce an instrument that was unsurpassed in sensitivity and convenience until it was replaced by CCD detectors in the early 1980&#8217;s. This scanner, nicknamed the Wampler-Robinson scanner, became a world-recognized state-of-the-art scientific instrument. The 1973 issue of the <em>Guinness Book of World Records</em> gave credit to Margaret Burbidge for seeing the furthest in space using the Lick Observatory's Wampler-Robinson scanner. This record stood for 10 years until it was finally outdone and awarded to astronomers at a new telescope in Australia, the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT), which also used a Wampler-Robinson scanner.<br/><br/>It is hard to overstate the power, novelty, and impact of the Wampler-Robinson scanner when it was introduced. Previously, taking astronomical spectra had relied on photographic plates, which had quantum efficiencies of only about 1% and were also imprecise and hard to calibrate. The Wampler-Robinson scanner was astronomy&#8217;s first panoramic photon-counting detector, with 20% photocathode efficiency. Widely used by UC astronomers during the 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s, it contributed to such landmark papers as the Faber-Jackson relation (the first scaling law for galaxies), the discovery of the Great Attractor and large-scale deviations from uniform Hubble expansion, the definitive classification system for the spectra of active galactic nuclei and radio galaxies, the Lick index system for estimating the ages and abundance of old stellar populations, the first census of damped Ly&#945; absorbers in distant galaxy spectra, landmark spectroscopic redshifts for the 3C catalog of radio galaxies, and the first accurate chemical element abundances of globular cluster stars. The scanner was later outfitted with a state-of-the-art polarimeter, data from which led to the &#8220;unified model&#8221; for accreting black holes in active galactic nuclei and quasars.<br/><br/>Around 1990, CCDs began to eclipse image-dissector scanners on account of their higher quantum efficiency and larger number of pixels, and Robinson led Lick Observatory&#8217;s entry into this exciting new field. The cracker-jack team of electronic engineers and programmers he assembled designed and built state-of the art CCD detectors for both Lick and Keck instruments, including HIRES, DEIMOS, and ESI. These detectors are still performing flawlessly some 20 to 30 years later.<br/><br/>A little-known paper in 1995 describes a collaboration between Robinson and William Borucki to test the ultimate precision for differential photometry measurements by front-illuminated CCDs. The paper achieved a precision of one part in 100,000, which was the key technology that opened up transit photometry on the Kepler satellite and led to the discovery of thousands of extrasolar planets.<br/><br/>In August 1973, Robinson attended the International Astronomical Union conference to present a paper on the Wampler-Robinson scanner. The conference was held in Sydney, Australia, and it was here that he met his soon-to-be wife, Sue. They married in Santa Cruz in 1976 and built a home there in 1978. With three acres surrounding their home, Lloyd&#8217;s farming roots soon came to the fore, and the property now boasts numerous fruit trees as well as many other varieties of trees and crops he planted.<br/><br/>Though one realizes in retrospect that Robinson&#8217;s leadership at UCO/Lick was profound, at the time it was often barely discernible, disguised as it was by his distinctive, gentle touch. He was that most remarkable of leaders, able to motivate and draw the best from everyone around him without at any time coercing, or even appearing to push. Unflappable, calm, generous, and caring, Robinson was the perfect mentor. His impeccable standards of professional and personal conduct were shining examples to all around him.<br/><br/>Of all his joys, the greatest was his family, whom he loved dearly. He is survived by his beloved wife, Susie (Edworthy-Gerdes), son Barton Robinson, daughter Margo Clayson (Ron), step-daughter Karen Gerdes (Steven Wykamp), and step-son David Gerdes. He is also survived by seven grandchildren: Aaron Clayson (Crystal), Daniel Clayson (Heather), Katrina Clayson, Joseph Clayson, Blake Singer-Robinson, Gabrielle Singer-Robinson and Nicole Singer-Robinson, as well as two step-grandsons Carl Yarroll and Aaron Wykamp. He is also survived by four great-grandchildren: Dante Clayson, Ashlyn Clayson, Brynlee Clayson and Miriam Clayson as well as his brother Melvin Robinson (Lorna), sister Grace Cain (John), four nephews, and a niece.<br/><br/>A memorial service will be held at a later date at Peace United Church of Christ, 900 High Street, Santa Cruz.

<p>This afternoon, the Health Officer for the County of Santa Cruz issued a <a href="http://santacruzhealth.org/Portals/7/Pdfs/Coronavirus/Shelter%20in%20Place%20Order%20March%2016%202020.pdf">Shelter in Place Order</a> and the Health Officer for the County of Santa Clara issued a <a href="https://www.sccgov.org/sites/phd/DiseaseInformation/novel-coronavirus/Pages/order-health-officer-031620.aspx">Shelter in Place Order</a> both of which are in effect through April 7. These directives mandate that people self-isolate, except to leave to provide or receive essential services, and permits the continuation of essential businesses. &#8220;Essential businesses&#8221; that can continue during this shelter in place period include educational institutions defined as:</p>
<p>&#8220;Educational institutions&#8212;including public and private K&#8211;12 schools, colleges, and universities&#8212;for purposes of facilitating remote learning or performing essential functions, provided that social distancing of six-feet per person is maintained to the greatest extent possible&#8221;</p>
<p>In light of these latest actions, the following changes will apply to campus operations at locations in Santa Cruz County. Campus locations outside of Santa Cruz County will be making localized decisions based on guidance from local health officials and additional communications to those groups will be coming out shortly. We are moving to a reduced mode of operation through April 7, and expanding previously communicated changes to spring quarter operations. Additional changes might need to be made as the situation continues to evolve.</p>
<p>Though we have not had a confirmed case of COVID&#8211;19 on campus at this point, these changes are being made to support the health and safety of our campus community.</p>
<h3>Final Examinations</h3>
<p>Students should expect remote final examinations will be held at their scheduled time unless they hear otherwise from their instructor. Students who are not able to complete their remote final examination due to travel or technology limitations should contact their instructor to discuss options. Instructors should be in regular communication with their students regarding details surrounding the remote final examination.</p>
<h3>Student Housing</h3>
<p>We strongly urge students who are able to safely return to their permanent residence to do so by Sunday, March 29, and plan to remain there for the remainder of the academic year. The shelter in place orders allow for this travel. Exceptions to stay in campus housing beyond Sunday, March 29 will be made for students who meet one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>do not have access to alternate housing;</li>
<li>have economic needs that do not enable them to return to their permanent residence;</li>
<li>can not relocate due to personal health or safety considerations;</li>
<li>have permanent residences in areas highly impacted by COVID&#8211;19;</li>
<li>have permanent residences that do not have the infrastructure needed to support remote learning; or</li>
<li>have other situations that should be considered on a case-by-case basis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students who intend to vacate need to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIwZgQtIfFLxRSzh03rHmVYqYonNja0X9FJ-UV8HKlYn5QIA/viewform">complete a form to initiate the check-out and refund processes</a>. Students who remove all of their belongings from their campus residence and return their keys by April 5 will be eligible for a full refund of any housing and dining fees paid for spring quarter. Students unable to move their belongings out by April 5 can work with the Housing Office to determine if alternative arrangements are available. For any student moving out after April 5, charges will be prorated based on the date the room is vacated and the checkout process is completed. Students cancelling and moving out will not be assessed the standard cancellation fee. The Campus Housing Office will provide additional information for those students remaining on campus for spring via one of the exceptions listed above. Students who have questions about this process should contact their relevant <a href="https://housing.ucsc.edu/contact/index.html">Housing/Student Life Office</a>.</p>
<h3>Dining Services</h3>
<p>Effective today (March 16), Dining Services has <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/03/covid-dining-changes.html">moved to a take-out only mode</a> and has reduced the number of open dining spaces.</p>
<h3>Campus Events</h3>
<p>Campus events and events hosted in/on campus facilities will be canceled or postponed through the remainder of the spring quarter. Event sponsors can contact the <a href="https://lex.ucsc.edu">Office of the Campus Counsel</a> to discuss considerations for event contracts. Information on commencement will be forthcoming.</p>
<h3>Campus Travel</h3>
<p>All campus travel scheduled to take place before April 7 that does not comply with orders outlined in the Shelter in Place directive should be canceled or postponed. All non-essential business travel after April 7 should be canceled or postponed for the rest of the spring quarter. Principal Officers will provide guidance on any needed exceptions, though they must comply with other local and federal travel guidelines.</p>
<h3>Employees and Leave Options</h3>
<p>Only those employees who must be on campus to maintain critical operations should come to the campus through April 7. Principal Officers should provide guidance on the minimal on-campus operations required during this time and communicate to their staff. Guidance regarding operations after that date will be forthcoming. All others should work remotely. For those unable to work remotely, and in order to support our employees during this unprecedented time, UC President Janet Napolitano has <a href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2020/01/executive-order-re-paid-administrative-leave-03-16-20.pdf">implemented new leave guidelines as follows</a>:</p>
<p>All employees shall be eligible to receive a one-time allotment of up to 128 hours of paid administrative leave, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>All hours must be used by December 31, 2020, or the allotment shall expire;</li>
<li>The hours may be used at any time during the period of this Executive Order, including intermittently, either before or after the use of any accrued leave or other paid leave, at the request of the employee, in consultation with the supervisor, provided that such use shall not adversely affect the delivery of essential university services, including in particular, the clinical services delivered by UC Health;</li>
<li>The number of hours for employees who work less than full-time shall be prorated according to the percent of the appointment;</li>
<li>Exempt employees who do not accrue sick or vacation leave are eligible for the one-time allotment of the paid administrative leave.</li>
<li>The paid administrative leave hours may only be used for the following purposes:
<ul>
<li>When an employee is unable to work due to the employee&#8217;s own COVID&#8211;19-related illness or that of a family member;</li>
<li>When an employee is unable to work because the employee has been directed not to come to the worksite for COVID&#8211;19-related reasons and/or the work site has implemented a COVID&#8211;19-related remote-work program or is under a shelter in place order and it is not operationally feasible for the employee to work remotely;</li>
<li>When an employee is unable to work because a COVID&#8211;19-related school or daycare closure requires the employee to be at home with a child or dependent, and it is not operationally feasible for the employee to work remotely or in conjunction with the childcare commitment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Research Activities</h3>
<p>The Office of Research has been coordinating research continuity planning across divisions. Additional information is <a href="https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/covid-19.html">available online</a>. Principal Officers can provide division-specific guidance on how research should be handled during the shelter in place.</p>
<h3>Planned Power Outage</h3>
<p>The planned power outage scheduled to take place during spring break in order to connect the new PV array at the East Remote lot will be delayed to a later date.</p>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>McHenry Library and the Science and Engineering Library will be open on Tuesday, March 17 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Both libraries will be closed on Wednesday, March 18 and will remain closed until April 7.</p>
<h3>Bookstore</h3>
<p>The bookstore will be closed to walk-in shopping. Online orders can be picked up at the will call window. The Express Store will remain open but will follow stringent social distancing guidelines and limit the number of individuals allowed inside at any time.</p>
<p>This continues to be an incredibly dynamic situation. We appreciate your cooperation and patience as we collectively work to mitigate the spread of COVID&#8211;19.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jody Greene is eager&#8212;almost desperate&#8212;to help her colleagues who are facing the unprecedented challenge of shifting to remote instruction for the entire spring quarter. Her email signature is loaded with hot links, a call for "</span><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2020/03/17/shifting-unexpectedly-remote-instruction-requires-many-human-solutions-tech"><span style="font-weight: 400;">radical sharing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">," and encouragement to "get cozy with&#160;</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ccsudB2vwZ_GJYoKlFzGbtnmftGcXwCIwxzf-jkkoCU/preview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this great guide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to teaching remotely, start to finish."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the director of the&#160;</span><a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CITL), Greene is on the front lines, hearing the fears and frustrations of faculty and teaching staff who feel overwhelmed by the prospect of redesigning their courses so swiftly. She has been working 100-hour weeks with her "tiny but mighty" team from CITL, in partnership with Online Education, the Faculty Instructional Technology Center, and Academic Divisional Computing, to push out&#160;</span><a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/teaching-resources/teaching-during-unplanned-events/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tools and resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ease the burden--from workshops and written instructions to video demonstrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It's unprecedented to move 1,500 instructors into remote teaching," said Greene. "I recognize the enormous burden it puts on instructors to redesign courses for remote learning in spring quarter. We are providing support as best we can."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CITL and the Division of Student Success are rolling out two websites today&#160; to address the needs of instructors (including Teaching Assistants) and students,</span> <a href="http://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keepteaching.ucsc.edu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://keeplearning.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keeplearning.ucsc.edu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Content is being developed locally, and carefully selected from teaching centers around the country, to address the needs and concerns of the UCSC teaching community and students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"There's a&#160;</span><a href="https://cte.rice.edu/blogarchive/2020/3/13/inclusion-equity-and-access-while-teaching-remotely?fbclid=IwAR2C9tZm0QcqmrdVNTr8WSz2fbtTUNleJ8HBPJ3Q07KuaDUJ-inhShNcC2w"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fantastic site</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Rice University to make sure we're thinking about educational equity as we begin to design remote courses," said Greene. (That's one of the hot links in her signature.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greene is quick to acknowledge the unique challenges of offering a course entirely remotely&#8212;a challenge that's distinct from wrapping up the end of a 10-week course, as instructors did for winter quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The students don't know each other, so how do they introduce themselves?" she asked. "How do you find out what barriers they're facing? How do you find out about things like technology and their ability to attend because of jobs and time zones?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Courses can be offered live in real time&#8212;known as synchronous remote teaching&#8212;or pre-recorded, known as asynchronous instruction. "These pose different design challenges," said Greene. "Asynchronous has greater capacity to accommodate time zones, limited internet access, and things like illness, but it's important to make sure there's at least one synchronous meeting per week, even if some students won&#8217;t be able to attend in real time"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"All of this requires new and different prep for instructors," said Greene. "I don't want to minimize the difficulty of that task, especially when instructors are facing unprecedented stresses in every other area of their lives.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>Getting through finals, looking ahead to Spring Quarter</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susan Strome, chair of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology, said students are experiencing such high levels of anxiety and stress during finals week that figuring out how to offer them optimal instruction during spring quarter is imperative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This is the time to focus on giving the best instruction to any students who choose to stay enrolled," she said. Strome, who has been recognized for the excellence of her own teaching, is working with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">PBSci Associate Dean</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Grant Hartzog and John Tamkun, head of the department's curriculum committee, to develop alternative options to in-person labs, since all in-person instruction has been suspended for spring quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It's all hands on deck," she said. "Every department is scrambling like we are. We have to figure out what's feasible and what's in the students' best interest."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amanda Smith, assistant professor of literature, echoed Strome's comments, saying faculty are struggling. "This is not easy," she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith has years of experience with hybrid teaching that blends in-person and remote instruction, and she has reached out to her colleagues as a CITL "ambassador" to share her knowledge about Canvas, the learning management system UCSC uses as a portal for remote teaching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I use Canvas extensively because I use a flipped classroom model, where students do a lot at home so that we can use most of our class time to go deeper into course materials," she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the campus shifts to remote delivery of instruction, Smith is concerned about her students, most of whom are first-generation Latinx women who have worked hard to access higher education. For students who will be expected to look after younger siblings who are no longer in school because of the coronavirus outbreak, Smith says asynchronous delivery is the more equitable option, rather than asking students to show up at scheduled course times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But her concerns extend more broadly, as well. "I want to recognize that this is a really hard time not just for students, but for faculty and staff," she said. "Faculty are really worried about this transition."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As faculty at UCSC and universities across the country ramp up to deliver their courses remotely, online education is going to be tested as never before. But Greene is skeptical about the value of what she calls the "Great Remote Learning Hack of 2020."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This isn't going to tell us anything about fully designed online education courses," said Greene. "It's not going to inform us, positively or negatively, because this is such a unique challenge. We will never again choose to move the whole university to remote learning for an entire quarter."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greene continued: "Where there is value is seeing faculty turning to each other as resources for teaching. What people are going to learn is that they can work together collectively around teaching, and they can be resources for each other, even when no one is an expert. This will get us through the current situation, and ultimately, they will learn that teaching is more pleasurable and more intellectually interesting when they participate in it in the company of others."</span></p>
<h3>"Everyone is sharing the burden"</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stacy Philpott in Environmental Studies wasn't teaching in winter quarter, so she has relied heavily on CITL to learn how to better use Zoom in advance of her spring quarter agroecology field course. The class has historically been about 25 percent field trips and field work, so she is reimagining that and figuring out how to offer "virtual" tours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I'm kind of looking forward to figuring out what kind of virtual field trips we can offer," said Philpott. "On the upside, people all over the country are sharing information and ideas and setting up wikis. Everyone is sharing the burden."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With dozens of environmental studies students facing cancelled field classes, as well as aborted study abroad and UC/DC experiences, the department is "combining forces" to up enrollments and ensure that undergraduates can get the classes they need, including two-credit internships, offered remotely, that might be needed to maintain financial aid eligibility, and senior "capstone" experiences required for graduation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Questions of access are on Philpott's mind, as well, and she worries about students who lack access to the internet, adding that a message from ITS about efforts to secure low-cost options was welcome. As the director of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, she wonders how the UCSC Farm and Alan Chadwick Garden will continue to produce food for campus dining halls, pop-ups, and no-cost outlets at a moment when food insecurity among students is likely to jump. "We usually have around 40 apprentices, 45 student interns, 16 student staff," she said. "We're down to 10 staff and a few student staff who want to keep producing and delivering food."</span></p>
<h3>The show must go on</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to making the speedy pivot to remote teaching, Interim Arts Dean Ted Warburton conjures up the old adage, "The show must go on!"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What's most difficult is the canceling of actual performances," said Warburton. "The opera is a huge favorite for everybody, but it just won't be an option for this year."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warburton is impressed by the creative problem solving he's seeing among arts faculty. "Each field has really unique challenges, and we've been meeting regularly," he said. "What's encouraging is how department chairs have pushed out this information and engaged the entire faculty in problem solving."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CITL has been "fantastic," he said. "I've pointed faculty to CITL a lot. It's been important for reducing anxiety and giving faculty a sense of agency about the possibilities of remote teaching beyond Zoom."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the cancelation of all labs and studio instruction, Warburton laments that facilities and materials like the bronze forge, musical instruments, and "our bodies connecting together in person" won't be options, but he is inspired by his colleagues' determination to provide students with a good experience in the arts.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We are the smallest academic division so we tend to rely on each other," he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This quarter, he noted, Open Studios went&#160;</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/UcscArtDepartment/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=3520644898009446"><span style="font-weight: 400;">virtual</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with YouTube links to other courses showing final projects. In Film and Digital Media, faculty hope to allow students to check out cameras for the entire quarter rather than just a few days. They are also looking into ways to give students access to stream or share films owned by the campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Music, lecturer Brian Baumbusch will compose a piece for members of the wind ensemble that is especially tailored for remote instruction. Individual performers will record their parts remotely throughout the quarter, and students will combine these musical fragments to create a final, cohesive piece. "Cool, right?" exclaimed Warburton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Dance, Associate Professor Gerald Casel and lecturer Rashad Pridgen are collaborating on a studio course, as well as the faculty-directed dance show, to produce a "Dance for Camera" class that features video documentation of hip-hop and street dance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This is what artists do, because the show must go on," said Warburton. "We are incorrigible optimists. People have something to learn from us artists."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, he said, "The idea of shutting down and not serving our students is not an option. Students will learn from this, too&#8212;how you behave in a crisis. It's about coming together, supporting each other, and forging ahead."</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ea782add807270175680b368f3c1b102"><name>temp-cessation-of-non-essential-on-campus-research-operations</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Temporary cessation of non-essential on-campus research operations</title><summary>As you know, we are in the midst of a dangerous global pandemic and the County of Santa Cruz has issued a Shelter in Place Order for all residents.

For&#160;the safety of our campus community, we&#160;are now in the process of winding down all but essential on-campus operations. Late last week we sent&#160;out an email&#160;to all researchers about our&#160;<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/covid-19.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584567754637000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGZIYQ87obZfz1yzvxlB4suacyLQA" href="https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/covid-19.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Research Continuity&#160;with COVID-19</a>&#160;webpage, in which we&#160;recommended that faculty and researchers take&#160;certain steps to prepare for a possible&#160;campus shutdown. We are writing now to require that all labs follow that&#160;guidance and, as spelled out further below,&#160;obtain approval for any research projects&#160;and key research personnel you believe must remain active on campus during this&#160;time. Until further notice, all projects and personnel&#160;not&#160;approved are required to wind down on-campus&#160;research operations by the end of the week.&#160;For the purposes of this communication,&#160;<span face="Calibri, sans-serif" size="2" style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: small;">o</span>n-campus refers to all research operations at UCSC locations within a jurisdiction with a Shelter in Place Order.</div>
<div><br/>Even where research is deemed essential,&#160;we need to reduce the density of people working in UCSC research spaces. All&#160;principal investigators must&#160;communicate with trainees and other lab members about&#160;preparation for the shutdown of all non-critical research activities.<br/><br/>We understand that the long-term&#160;viability of many research programs during this period will require management&#160;of essential animal lines, equipment, liquid&#160;nitrogen stocks, and certain&#160;long-term experiments. To meet these needs, each laboratory (or neighboring&#160;group of laboratories) must identify 1-2 key&#160;personnel who will be responsible&#160;for any&#160;essential&#160;ongoing maintenance.<br/><br/>When determining the appropriate&#160;size of your lab&#8217;s &#8220;skeleton crew,&#8221; please also consider any equipment that&#160;might require gas or cryogen&#160;monitoring/service, such as deep-storage freezers,&#160;electron microscopes, mass spectrometers, and incubators. Keep in mind that any&#160;potentially hazardous&#160;operation will require at least two trained and qualified&#160;persons be present.

Please read below for instructions.</strong><br/><br/>The emergence of COVID-19 is presenting unprecedented challenges for communities all across the country. As COVID-19 mitigation actions escalate across the country, our campus is making additional changes to our operations.<br/><br/>In order to dramatically reduce the density on campus, we <strong>strongly urge</strong> students who can safely leave to do so by Sunday, March 29. This will allow the remaining students who are not able to leave campus the recommended space for effective social distancing.<br/><br/><strong>ACTION REQUIRED by March 20:</strong> Undergraduate, Graduate and Family Student Housing Tenants</p>
<ul>
<li>Students <strong>departing</strong> Housing - Complete the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIwZgQtIfFLxRSzh03rHmVYqYonNja0X9FJ-UV8HKlYn5QIA/viewform" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Intent to Vacate</a> form <em>(form requires a UCSC account)</em></li>

<p>Additionally, students who have already returned to their permanent residence and need to request an extension to remove their belongings at a later date should <strong>ALSO</strong> complete the <a href="https://forms.gle/rQT4rM6gsQiDYRDJ7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Late Checkout</a> form.<br/><br/>More detail below:<br/><br/><strong>Students Moving Out of University Housing</strong><br/>Whether you have already left campus or are planning to soon, please complete the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIwZgQtIfFLxRSzh03rHmVYqYonNja0X9FJ-UV8HKlYn5QIA/viewform" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Intent to Vacate</a> form (form requires a UCSC account)&#160;by Friday, March 20. <strong>If you have already completed this form then you do not need to complete it again.</strong><br/><br/>Students who complete their move-out and/or have submitted their Intent to Vacate notice by Friday, March 20 will be eligible for a full refund of any housing and dining fees for spring quarter. This will also apply to students who need to request a Late Checkout because they are unable to retrieve their belongings and complete the move-out process at this time.<br/><br/>We will process cancellations and make adjustments to student accounts in the order in which move-out process has been completed. We appreciate your patience during this time and advise that you closely monitor your university account (<a href="https://my.ucsc.edu/psp/csprd/?cmd=login&amp;languageCd=ENG&amp;" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my.ucsc.edu</a>) to see when your charges have been adjusted. Your account will not accrue a housing late fee while we work to process your adjustment.<br/><br/>Additionally, we will not be voiding guarantees for students who cancel their university housing for spring 2020. Therefore, if a student has a guarantee that extends beyond spring 2020, they will retain that guarantee as long as they apply during the April 13-20 Priority Housing Application Period.<br/><br/><strong>Students Remaining in University Housing</strong><br/>If you need to remain in university housing through spring, please indicate that by completing the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4ON05ePawOPCyRSz0Z5DD8Q0T-X2LQj-gAMdoi97toIvJyg/viewform?usp=send_form" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Remain in Residence</a> form by Friday, March 20.<br/><br/>Students may consider remaining on campus during the Spring Quarter <strong>only</strong> if they satisfy at least one of the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not have access to alternate housing</li>
<li>Financial resources do not enable a return to their permanent residence</li>
<li>Personal health or safety considerations prohibit relocation</li>
<li>Permanent residence does not have, and cannot obtain the infrastructure needed to support remote learning</li>
<li>Other extenuating circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p>As a university, we understand the challenges faced in following public health guidelines to limit close contact with others to slow the spread of coronavirus. Your health and safety are our first priority, and we are taking actions to significantly increase social distancing on our campus.<br/><br/>It is likely we will need to close some of the residential buildings and relocate those students remaining on campus into fewer locations, as well as adjust our housing and dining operations to improve social distancing. These decisions will be made once we have determined how many students have a need to remain in university housing.<br/><br/>Thank you for your patience and flexibility as we work to keep students and the UCSC community healthy and safe.<br/><br/>You can find additional information on the following sites:<br/>UCSC Main Site: <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/coronavirus/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.ucsc.edu/coronavirus/index.html</a><br/>Housing: <a href="https://housing.ucsc.edu/covid-19/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://housing.ucsc.edu/covid-19/index.html</a><br/>Dining: <a href="https://dining.ucsc.edu/covid-19/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://dining.ucsc.edu/covid-19/index.html</a></p>

The packs, which are activated by water and are often included in emergency kits, produce carbon monoxide, which can be extremely dangerous if inhaled. Symptoms of carbon-monoxide poisoning include headache, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. In extreme cases, inhalation can be fatal.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department and Santa Cruz fire officials have responded to campus residential halls a half-dozen times in recent months after gas detectors alerted them to dangerous levels of carbon monoxide. Locating the source is often difficult, as the gas quickly dissipates and gives off no smell, but authorities believe the use of thermal packs in confined dorm rooms is the cause. Campus officials worry that more students may attempt to use the packs to heat food now that dining is operating on a more limited schedule due to the COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
<p>The packs are inappropriate for on-campus use. They are designed for use only in well-ventilated areas. Fire officials caution that faulty packs also have been known to ignite on contact with water or moist air, sometimes explosively.</p>
<p><strong>Safety Tips</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you feel you or others are in danger, immediately call 911.</li>
<li>If you see anyone using thermal heating packs on campus, alert them to the danger, then call 911. Reports may also be made by utilizing one of the several &#8220;blue light,&#8221; emergency or elevator phones located throughout the campus.</li>
<li>Trust your instincts. If something makes you uneasy, tell someone or leave the area.</li>

<div><strong>Guidance for Employees and Supervisors Regarding the Use of Paid Administrative Leave Pursuant to President Napolitano&#8217;s Executive Order Dated March 16, 2020</strong></div>
<div></div>
The University of California has modified the emergency temporary leave policies issued on March 9th in accordance with an<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2020/01/executive-order-re-paid-administrative-leave-03-16-20.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584632935696000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHasVcvUhNkKSuAwKVQCRamEc68qg" href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2020/01/executive-order-re-paid-administrative-leave-03-16-20.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Executive Order issued by President Napolitano on March 16th</a><span>&#160;</span>granting paid administrative leave to university employees who are impacted by the COVID-19 emergency. This message provides guidance about how we will implement the Executive Order (EO) for academic, staff and student employees at UC Santa Cruz.<br/><br/>This remains a very fluid situation, and the guidance below may be updated as new information becomes available. Managers and supervisors are encouraged to provide as much flexibility as possible to employees needing to take leave.<br/><br/><u>All Employees</u></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Effective immediately, all employees (including staff, academic and student employees) will be eligible to receive up to 128 hours paid administrative leave in order to cope with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
<li>The Paid Administrative Leave may only be used for the following purposes:
<ul>
<li>When an employee is unable to work due to the employee&#8217;s own COVID-19-related illness or that of a family member;</li>
<li>When an employee is unable to work because the employee has been directed not to come to the worksite for COVID-19-related reasons and/or the work site has implemented a COVID-19-related remote-work program or is under a shelter in place order and it is not operationally feasible for the employee to work remotely;</li>
<li>When an employee is unable to work because a COVID-19-related school or daycare closure requires the employee to be at home with a child or dependent, and it is not operationally feasible for the employee to work remotely or in conjunction with the dependent care commitment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The allocation for employees with less than full time appointments shall be prorated based on appointment percentage</li>
<li>The 128 hours may be used consecutively in one block or incrementally</li>
<li>In making the determination as to whether to grant the leave, supervisors must take into account the operational needs of the University with special consideration given to the critical importance of maintaining the continuity of medical center operations</li>
<li>Employees may still use accrued sick, vacation or paid time off in order to address their own illness or the serious medical condition of a family member.</li>
<li>The Paid Administrative Leave may be used prior to usage of other accrued leave.</li>
<li>Paid Administrative Leave can be used retroactively to March 1, 2020.</li>
<li>Subject to the University&#8217;s ongoing operational needs, the paid administrative leave provided pursuant to the Executive Order must be used no later than December 31, 2020.</li>
<li>Paid Administrative Leave is available for any new employees hired during the duration of President Napolitano&#8217;s March 16, 2020 Executive Order.</li>
<li>An employee who separates from the employment of the University before December 31, 2020 will lose eligibility for Paid Administrative Leave; there is no &#8220;cash-in&#8221; value connected to the leave.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Employees who are essential to on-campus operations may be required to come to work to ensure educational and business continuity. Managers and employees are encouraged to work together to formulate plans for shift coverage in these essential operational areas to ensure social distancing practices are being followed.<br/><br/><u>Staff Employees</u></div>
<div><br/><strong>All</strong><span>&#160;</span>individual staff employees are eligible for administrative leave with pay.<span>&#160;</span><u>However, individuals who do not meet one of the three criteria described in the EO for using administrative leave with pay will need to cover unplanned absences with accruals.</u><span>&#160;</span>Additionally, supervisors are required to approve the administrative leave with pay, and such approval will be based on operational necessity to continue essential services.</div>
<div><br/>At this time, formal telecommuting agreements are not being used for COVID-19 related remote work. Supervisors and managers should exercise discretion in determining whether individuals may take home university property to complete work from home. If university property, such as laptops, keyboards, or other items, are brought home by employees, supervisors are encouraged to log equipment serial numbers to track which items are being used in employee homes. &#160;</div>
<div><br/>Individual staff members who meet one of the four criteria for administrative leave outlined in the executive order shall enter the appropriate number of hours into CruzPay. Employees will select &#8220;Admin Leave with Pay&#8221; and indicate &#8220;COVID&#8221; in the note section on their timesheet on that day. &#160;&#160;</div>
<div><br/>Supervisors and managers will need to work with their employees before approving timesheets to ensure administrative leave with pay is used appropriately for one of the four criteria. Once timesheets are approved, the administrative leave will be paid according to the hours entered into individual time records. The campus is no longer requiring use of the administrative leave with pay form to complete the request for administrative leave with pay for COVID related reasons.</div>
<div><br/>Part time employees are eligible for the 128 hours of administrative leave with pay, prorated based on their percent of time and regularly scheduled hours of work. Administrative leave with pay should be recorded according to the employee&#8217;s hours of work and should not exceed their part time schedule.&#160;</div>
<div><br/>Employees who are currently on an approved leave of absence (not related to COVID-19) should continue to record your sick leave and/or vacation leave as discussed in your leave consultation.&#160; If your circumstances have changed, due to COVID-19, please work directly with your Leave Coordinator.</div>
<div><br/><u>Hourly Student Employees</u></div>
<div><br/>Student employees are eligible for the 128 hours of administrative leave, prorated based on their percent of time and regularly scheduled hours of work. Administrative leave with pay should be recorded according to the employee&#8217;s hours of work and should not exceed their part time schedule.&#160;</div>
<div><br/>Individual student employees who meet one of the four criteria for administrative leave outlined in the executive order shall enter the appropriate number of hours into CruzPay. Student employees will select &#8220;Admin Leave with Pay&#8221; and indicate &#8220;COVID&#8221; in the note section on the timesheet. &#160;&#160;</div>
<div><br/>Supervisors and managers will need to work with their student employees before approving timesheets to ensure administrative leave with pay is used appropriately for one of the COVID related reasons. Once timesheets are approved, the administrative leave will be paid according to the hours entered into individual timesheets. The campus is no longer requiring use of the administrative leave with pay form to complete the request for administrative leave with pay for COVID related reasons.<br/><br/><u>Academic Employees<br/></u><br/>Paid Administrative Leave is available for all academic appointees, policy-covered and represented, for the COVID-19-related reasons described in President Napolitano&#8217;s March 16, 2020 Executive Order.<br/><br/>Use of Paid Administrative Leave must not adversely affect the delivery of essential university services. The delivery of instruction is an essential university service. Faculty who are unable to continue delivering instruction should immediately notify their department chair.<br/><br/>Employees who report time or absences in CruzPay should record Paid Administrative Leave on their timesheets. Employees will select &#8220;Admin Leave with Pay&#8221; and indicate &#8220;COVID&#8221; in the note section on the timesheet on that day. When approving timesheets, supervisors are affirming that Paid Administrative Leave is being used in accordance with the<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2020/01/executive-order-re-paid-administrative-leave-03-16-20.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584632935697000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGPxFYuwPSkjHMcSB5AzKo43gX-zA" href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2020/01/executive-order-re-paid-administrative-leave-03-16-20.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Executive Order</a>.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>For exempt academic employees, Paid Administrative Leave only needs to be reported for full-day absences; a day is defined as the regular time that an appointee would have worked on that day. For such exempt employees, there will be up to 16 days on which the Paid Administrative Leave would occur.</li>
<li>For non-exempt hourly employees, Paid Administrative Leave should be reported on the timesheet in hourly increments. Non-exempt employees are eligible for the 128 hours of administrative leave with pay, prorated based on the appointment percentage.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>For faculty and academic student employees who do not complete timesheets (TAs, GSIs, and GSRs), Paid Administrative Leave of 16 days or less should be arranged with the chair/ supervisor. Employees must notify their department chair or faculty supervisor and divisional academic personnel coordinator if they anticipate an absence of more than 16 days, whether consecutive or intermittent. Divisional academic personnel staff will advise employees and supervisors about all available paid leave options on a case by case basis. Divisional staff may consult with the Academic Personnel Office as needed.<br/><br/>Paid medical leave policies in the Academic Personnel Manual (APM 710) and respective collective bargaining agreements (Academic Researchers, Postdocs, Academic Student Employees, Non-Senate Instructional Unit, and Librarians) that are currently available for an appointee&#8217;s own illness will extend to cover all COVID-19 qualifying situations, including to care for a family member&#8217;s COVID-19 illness, and/or when working remotely is not operationally feasible and the appointee is directed or is under a public order to not to come to work. These extensions of academic policy are in place for the duration of President Napolitano&#8217;s March 16, 2020 Executive Order.<br/><br/>Paid Administrative Leave is not available for academic appointees in courtesy or without-salary appointments.<br/><br/>Deans retain the authority to provide leave with pay to academic employees for other good cause as delegated in<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apo.ucsc.edu/policy/capm/900.700.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584632935697000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF8uTJgP7XF621iPURWhAhE6Wb8ig" href="https://apo.ucsc.edu/policy/capm/900.700.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CAPM 900.700</a>.<br/><br/>For academic employees who are currently on leave, have by-agreement appointments, or for other questions, please consult with your Divisional Academic Personnel Office.</div></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Employees</audience><admin>Grace McClintock, AVP/APO and  Steve Stein AVC/SHR</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ef69fc64807270177be99ccd19184c37"><name>ches-faq</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>FAQs on Housing and Dining</title><summary>Read frequently asked questions related to dining and housing. </summary><start-date>1584514800000</start-date><display-name>FAQS on Housing and Dining</display-name><path>/2020/03/ches-faq</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/03/ches-faq</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1584564665412</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1584998836566</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><h3>Do I need to take action to let the campus know I am moving out or if I am remaining on campus?</h3>
<p>Yes! By March 20: Undergraduate, Graduate and Family Student Housing Tenants note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students departing Housing - <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIwZgQtIfFLxRSzh03rHmVYqYonNja0X9FJ-UV8HKlYn5QIA/viewform">Complete the Intent to Vacate form</a>&#160;(<em>form requires a UCSC account)</em></li>
<li>Students remaining in Housing - Complete the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4ON05ePawOPCyRSz0Z5DD8Q0T-X2LQj-gAMdoi97toIvJyg/viewform">Remain in Residence form</a>&#160;(<em>form requires a UCSC account)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, students who have already returned to their permanent residence and need to request an extension to remove their belongings at a later date should ALSO complete the <a href="https://forms.gle/rQT4rM6gsQiDYRDJ7">Late Checkout form</a>&#160;(<em>form requires a UCSC account)</em>.</p>
<h3>Why are students being asked to move off campus before spring quarter?</h3>
<p>In order to dramatically reduce the population density on campus, we strongly urge students who can safely leave to do so by Sunday, March 29. This will allow the remaining students who are not able to leave campus the recommended space for effective social distancing.</p>
<h3>Will I violate a shelter-in-place mandate by traveling to/from campus for purposes of move out?</h3>
<p>The March 16 <a href="https://www.santacruzhealth.org/Portals/7/Pdfs/Coronavirus/Shelter%20in%20Place%20Order%20March%2016%202020.pdf">Santa Cruz County Shelter-in-Place</a> mandate, Item 10.h.vi, indicates that travel to/from campus in order to return a student to their permanent residence is allowable while simultaneously observing social distancing requirements as defined in that same document.</p>
<p>Our campus is working closely with the County of Santa Cruz, and the County supports this interpretation. Please <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/03/covid-county-declaration.html">read a message from Vice Chancellor Sarah Latham</a> on this topic.</p>
<h3>What is the deadline for my departure from campus?</h3>
<p>We ask that students depart by Sunday, March 29 if possible. However, no spring housing fees will be assessed for those who need to remain in residence until April 5, or for those who cannot remove their belongings by April 5. A late check out date, at no additional charge, may be requested for students unable to remove their belongings by April 5 <a href="https://forms.gle/rQT4rM6gsQiDYRDJ7">using this form</a>&#160;(<em>form requires a UCSC account)</em>.</p>
<h3>Will I be refunded for spring quarter housing and/or dining fees if I&#8217;ve already paid them?</h3>
<p>Students who complete their Intent to Vacate notice by Friday, March 20 and who move out of residence by April 5th will be eligible for a full refund of any housing and dining fees for spring quarter. This will also apply to students who need to request a Late Checkout because they are unable to retrieve their belongings and complete the move-out process at this time.</p>
<h3>What do I do if I went home for spring break but my belongings remain on campus?</h3>
<p>Students who have already returned to their permanent residence and need to request an extension to remove their belongings at a later date should ALSO complete the <a href="https://forms.gle/rQT4rM6gsQiDYRDJ7">Late Checkout form</a>&#160;(<em>form requires a UCSC account)</em>. Students must be sure to submit the Intent to Vacate form, even if they have already departed campus.</p>
<p>It is requested that all students completely vacate the rooms they occupied on campus, taking all belongings with them.</p>
<h3>What will happen to my Housing Guarantee if I live off-campus for the spring quarter?</h3>
<p>We will not be voiding guarantees for students who cancel their university housing for spring 2020. Therefore, if a student has a guarantee that extends beyond spring 2020, they will retain that guarantee as long as they apply for fall housing during the April 13&#8211;20 Priority Housing Application Period.</p>
<h3>Who is allowed to remain living on campus for spring quarter?</h3>
<p>Students may consider remaining on campus during the Spring Quarter only if they satisfy at least one of the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not have access to alternate housing</li>
<li>Financial resources do not enable a return to their permanent residence</li>
<li>Personal health or safety considerations prohibit relocation</li>
<li>Permanent residence does not have, and cannot obtain the infrastructure needed to support remote learning</li>
<li>Other extenuating circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p>The university will not be seeking documentation or validation that one of these criteria have been met.</p>
<h3>If I&#8217;ve left campus but still have keys to my university housing assignment with me, how can I return them?</h3>
Please send keys in a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">padded or cardboard envelope</span> to the housing office of the community in which you lived per example below.&#160;<em>(Fill in the blank with the name of the community, e.g, Merrill College or Oakes College, etc.)</em><br/> <br/>____________ Housing Office UC Santa Cruz<br/>1156 High Street<br/>Santa Cruz, CA 95064<br/>
<h3>Must Family Student Housing residents vacate the campus?</h3>
No. All Family Student Housing residents are eligible to remain on campus.

The results help determine federal funding for many campus areas including adult education, science education including agriculture and engineering, wellness programs, health and mental health services, and financial aid in the form of Pell Grants.<br/><br/>These programs are vital to a successful university experience for yourselves and future generations of students. <strong>For these reasons, we urge all students to fill out the Census Bureau questionnaire using your address when at UC Santa Cruz, whether or not you are away due to COVID-19 and whether you live on or off campus.</strong> Census officials have asked that all university students, regardless of where you are currently located, register using the address you have when attending college in-person. This applies even if you have ended your housing contract on campus. <br/><br/>Beginning mid-March, off-campus students can respond to the census online, by phone or by mail. <br/><br/><strong>If you live off campus,</strong> you will likely receive instructions on how to fill out the census in the mail. That information will include an ID number that helps identify you when filling out the census. We urge you to visit <a href="https://my2020census.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my2020census.gov</a> to learn more and fill out the census. You can still fill out your census form if you do not have your ID number. Please take time now to fill out this form. <br/><br/><strong>If you live on campus in student housing or other group quarters,</strong> Census Bureau employees will be working with the campus administration to ensure you are counted. You are not being asked to register at this time, but please pay attention to additional emails that may have further instruction. <strong>Please do not register online yet or be counted at an address other than your address at UCSC.</strong> <br/><br/>Every student counted is important, with millions of dollars in financial aid, wellness and education funding at stake. <br/><br/>The Census Bureau does not ask whether you or anyone in your home is a U.S. citizen. The Census Bureau is not allowed to publicly release your responses in any way that could identify you. They do not share information with law enforcement or immigration officials. The information from the census is used to determine funding for important services provided to both citizens and noncitizens. <br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Your UC Santa Cruz Census Team</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz graduate and undergraduate students</audience><admin>Public Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f3a5aadc807270177be99ccd78a993bc"><name>cancelled-planned-campuswide-electrical-shutdowns-3-21-and-3-28</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>CANCELLED - Planned Campuswide Electrical Shutdowns (3/21 &amp; 3/28)</title><summary>These shutdowns, originally scheduled for Saturday, March 21, and Saturday, March 28, have been cancelled and will be rescheduled for a later date.

<p dir="ltr"><span>As faculty prepare to deliver more instruction remotely, using videoconferencing and related tools, we are providing this brief review of rules on copyright, both for protecting your own copyright, and respecting the rights of others:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Course Materials</span><span> (including lectures, lecture notes and materials, syllabi, study guides, web-ready content):</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Unless a faculty member used exceptional University resources to create course materials (which would generally only be done under a specific, signed agreement), faculty own the copyrights in the course materials they create.&#160; That means that only the faculty member, and anyone to whom the faculty member has granted permission, may reproduce, distribute or display (post/upload) course materials.

<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recordings of Course Presentations</span><span> (including notes and audio/video recordings):</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>With the following exceptions, no entity or individual may give, sell or otherwise distribute recordings of course presentations:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Students enrolled or auditing a course may give their own recordings to other enrolled/auditing students.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Faculty may use recordings in compliance with University policy.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Disability Resource Center may grant the accommodation of providing course recordings to students with a disability.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Materials:</span></p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr"><span>Post your materials only on a platform that is password-protected and accessible only to registered and enrolled students.</span></li>
<li dir="ltr">Advise students that your course materials and your course presentations are protected and that students may not share them except as provided by U.S. copyright law and University policy.&#160; You can share this information with students in your first class meeting, on your course website and in your syllabus. You might use this language:</li>
</ol>

<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Similarly, you own the copyright in your original papers and exam essays. If I am interested in posting your answers or papers on the course web site, I will ask for your written permission.&#8221;</em></p>
<ol start="3">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Include language on every page of your course materials (in a header or footer, on PDFs and in Canvas) that they are protected by copyright: &#8220;&#169; Faculty Name 2020&#8221;</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span>If you also include your UCSC email address, people who want to ask your permission to use your materials will be able to contact you easily.</span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you are concerned about students posting materials to CourseHero, know that CourseHero has advised UC counsel that its filtering tool will, in nearly all instances, prevent the upload of materials that include this sentence in a header or footer:&#160;</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span>&#8220;This content is protected and may not be shared, uploaded or distributed.&#8221;</span></p>
<ol start="5">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you find that your material has been uploaded to CourseHero, assert your copyrights by sending a DMC takedown notice using the CourseHero takedown portal at: </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.coursehero.com/copyright-infringement/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1584724030933000&amp;usg=AFQjCNESVN8uA5OYnRBQ_0KeRtBCqo5h-w" href="https://www.coursehero.com/copyright-infringement/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>https://www.coursehero.com/<wbr/>copyright-infringement/</span></a><span>&#160;&#160;</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;"><span>Once a valid takedown notice is submitted (which is why you should use the portal), CourseHero has a duty to act &#8220;expeditiously&#8221; &#8211; usually 2-3 days. Please note that other similar websites have not made this explicit commitment, but we do still recommend adding such header or footer to your uploaded content if you are concerned about asserting your copyrights.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Copyright of others</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Please be sure to respect the copyrights of others. Many materials can be used under the doctrine of Fair Use, but there are additional considerations when posting materials online. Much of remote teaching will be similar to your regular class: synchronous sharing of handwritten notes on some type of virtual board, slides, images and documents, course readings, and perhaps audio and video clips. You should also consider recording your class to be available to students for later viewing in case they cannot attend in real time.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Recorded classes should be posted in a location restricted to campus users, such as in your UCSC Google Drive</span><span> with a link in Canvas</span><span>. By not making recordings available to the general public, you limit your risk of violating the copyrights of others.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Guidelines for specific content:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Slide images &#8212; You can post your own content online, but images from other sources should not be posted in publicly available locations. Please be sure to post recorded classes in the approved locations listed above.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>In-lecture use of audio or video &#8212; Playing audio or video off of physical media during an in-person class session is most likely protected under a provision of copyright law often referred to as the "face-to-face teaching classroom use&#8221; exemption. However, that exemption doesn't cover playing the same media online. If you can limit audio and video use for your course to relatively brief clips, you may be able to justify those in lecture recordings or live-casts as fair use. For media use longer than brief clips, you may need to have students independently access the content outside of your lecture videos. Some further options are outlined below</span><span>.</span></p>
</li>

This module will replace the previous appraisal tool (appraisals.ucsc.edu) with a secure, online evaluation platform through UCPath.<br/><br/><strong>What&#8217;s Changing with ePerformance</strong><br/><br/>ePerformance differs from the previous appraisal tool in a few ways that will make the creation of appraisals easier than before: <br/>
<ul>
<li>Annual performance evaluations can be created in large batches, rather than one-by-one</li>
<li>There is no need to manually set up signature hierarchies, as these are automatically generated in ePerformance</li>
</ul>
Additionally, supervisors can track their employee&#8217;s performance throughout the appraisal period with Performance Notes.

<p>The project is a collaboration between the <a href="https://pbrg.pbsci.ucsc.edu/">Predatory Bird Research Group</a> at UC Santa Cruz and the Santa Cruz County Flood Control District, with help from Native Animal Rescue, Watsonville Wetlands Watch, and other organizations. Nest boxes for barn owls and hunting perches for hawks have been deployed along a 2.5-mile stretch of the river, and researchers are now monitoring both the burrowing activity of rodents and the hunting activity of raptors in the area.</p>
<p>Gophers and ground squirrels create extensive networks of underground tunnels, and when they burrow into the levee it can weaken the structure, leading to soil sloughing, erosion, and potentially even complete failure. Traditional pest management practices along the levee have included the use of fumigants to kill rodents in their burrows. But fumigation is expensive, and it also kills other animals that may be living in the burrows. Santa Cruz County has not been using anticoagulant poisons to kill rodents, due to their adverse effects on other species of wildlife.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Pajaro River is a great habitat corridor for wildlife, so it seemed like a good idea to find an alternative approach to rodent control, and the Pajaro Valley has a healthy and diverse raptor community that we could try to attract to the levee,&#8221; said Zeka Glucs, director of the Predatory Bird Research Group at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>A friend at the flood control district reached out to Glucs after reading about a study in Ventura County on the use of raptor perches on the levees there. Many species of hawks, owls, and other raptors prey on rodents, including gophers and ground squirrels. Initial surveys indicated that pocket gophers were more active along the Pajaro River levee than ground squirrels, so Glucs said she hopes to attract barn owls, which are gopher specialists.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a 50:50 ratio of barn owl nest boxes and raptor perches, whereas Ventura used more perches because they have more ground squirrels,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Glucs partnered with <a href="https://www.nativeanimalrescue.org/">Native Animal Rescue of Santa Cruz County</a> to help install the nest boxes and perches. <a href="https://www.watsonvillewetlandswatch.org/">Watsonville Wetlands Watch</a>, meanwhile, has been helping with community outreach and education, including getting students at the local schools involved. Another partner in the project is <a href="https://www.raptorsarethesolution.org/">Raptors Are the Solution</a>, which is helping with outreach materials and educating the public about the impacts of rodenticides on raptors.</p>
<p>Although the county does not use anticoagulant rodenticides, they are often used by homeowners and others to control rats and other rodents. Because it may take more than a week for a rodent to die after eating poison bait, predators that could otherwise help control rodent populations are often sickened or killed after eating poisoned rodents. Predators that are commonly affected by rat poisons include bobcats, foxes, coyotes, hawks, and owls.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are concerned about the use of rodenticides in neighboring agricultural areas, so we are reaching out, providing information, and trying to get the community to buy into this project,&#8221; Glucs said.</p>
<p>Although the county has reserved the right to fumigate any particularly problematic burrows in the levee, they will otherwise not be fumigating in the study area. The county has begun using carbon monoxide for fumigation, which has no persistent effects in the environment and won&#8217;t harm the raptors the project aims to recruit to the levee.</p>
<p>The surveys to monitor the results of the project are mostly being carried out by UC Santa Cruz student interns, under Glucs&#8217; supervision. UCSC&#8217;s <a href="https://norriscenter.ucsc.edu/">Norris Center for Natural History</a> is funding undergraduate internships and providing laboratory space for raptor pellet analysis (raptors cough up pellets of fur and bones that researchers can analyze to determine what the birds have been eating). The students are collecting data on rodent burrows and raptor activity in the 2.5-mile stretch where the nest boxes and perches were installed, as well as in another section of the river without those interventions for comparison.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopefully we&#8217;ll get some resident barn owls. There&#8217;s some indication that one box is being used, and we&#8217;ll follow it to get a sense of how many young they raise,&#8221; Glucs said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The great thing about this project is that we have undergraduate research, community outreach, and raptor conservation all wrapped together, and that&#8217;s really our mission as a group,&#8221; she added. &#8220;This project is just getting started, and if it&#8217;s successful we hope to make it a larger, ongoing study with the capacity to train more undergraduates in field research.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f9d5b4a7807270177be99ccded019da2"><name>postdoctoral-fellowship</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Postdoctoral fellowship supports planetary science research</title><summary>Elizabeth Baily has won a 51 Pegasi b Fellowship for research at UC Santa Cruz on exoplanets and the formation of planetary systems.</summary><start-date>1585206000000</start-date><display-name>Postdoctoral fellowship supports planetary science research</display-name><path>/2020/03/postdoctoral-fellowship</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/03/postdoctoral-fellowship</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1584739497102</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1584739547137</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/03/images/elizabeth-bailey-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/03/images/elizabeth-bailey-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>elizabeth-bailey-400.jpg</name><display-name>elizabeth-bailey-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>100152</file-size><width>400</width><height>495</height></image><image-alt>Elizabeth Bailey</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/03/images/elizabeth-bailey-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/03/images/elizabeth-bailey-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>elizabeth-bailey-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>elizabeth-bailey-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17363</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Elizabeth Bailey</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Elizabeth Bailey</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Elizabeth Baily wins 51 Pegasi b Fellowship for research at UC Santa Cruz on exoplanets and the formation of planetary systems</article-subhead><article-text><p>The Heising-Simons Foundation has awarded a 51 Pegasi b Fellowship to Elizabeth Baily to support her postdoctoral research in astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz starting in fall 2020.</p>
<p>Established in 2017, the Heising-Simons Foundation 51 Pegasi b Fellowship is named for the first exoplanet discovered orbiting a sun-like star. The fellowship provides up to $375,000 of support for independent research over three years, as well as other benefits including an annual summit to develop professional networks, exchange information and ideas, and foster collaboration.</p>
<p>In her research at UC Santa Cruz, Bailey aims to integrate a growing body of exoplanet data into a cohesive picture to contextualize the foundations of our solar system.</p>
<p>As a theorist, Bailey addresses broad questions about the nature of planetary systems. Her doctoral research has focused on the formation of &#8220;hot Jupiters,&#8221; a class of gas giant exoplanets that orbit astonishingly close to their host stars. In her postdoctoral fellowship, she plans to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding observations of distant planetary systems that contain hot Jupiters and other closely orbiting planets. She will also critically examine why there is a distinct lack of such planets in our own solar system. Her work will help determine which exoplanets could be habitable and explain how the solar system&#8217;s planets relate to these seemingly alien worlds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know our early solar system was an efficient planet production environment, but it completely lacks the types of planets Kepler has observed in many other systems. Discovering more about planets unique from our own will help us understand our place in the galactic context,&#8221; said Bailey, who is currently a Ph.D. candidate in planetary science at the California Institute of Technology.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fa5e292c807270177be99ccd3e2987de"><name>candidates-for-cpevc-to-make-virtual-campus-visits</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Candidates for CPEVC to make virtual campus visits</title><summary>As you are aware, our campus is conducting a search for a campus provost and executive vice chancellor.

That will ultimately help reduce the spread and intensity of COVID-19. The work you are doing is crucial, and we are deeply grateful for your efforts in these unprecedented times.<br/><br/>Continuing to work, teach and learn in the face of such uncertainty is not an attempt to maintain normalcy. It highlights our collective commitment to our students, our mission, and our community. Many of our students depend on financial aid, and by helping them stay the course, you are allowing them to access crucial resources and remain on track for graduation. You are helping valuable research and public service continue, advancing the mission of this university. Your work is greatly appreciated. <br/><br/>Crisis reveals the vulnerabilities of our systems and our ways of life. We are working to ensure that our campus remains able to house those who need it, and to do so as safely as possible. We are only just beginning to understand the scale of this public health challenge and the changes needed to support our community. With that in mind, we also thank you for your patience and engagement as these issues unfold. Your many contributions have not gone unnoticed.<br/><br/>This has not been an easy year for UC Santa Cruz. Though we are apart physically, we are together in spirit, and it has been and continues to be a privilege to face these difficulties and uncertainties alongside you. UCSC and our community will emerge from these challenges a stronger, more resilient campus.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz staff</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive and interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fa65970d807270177be99ccdec111e2a"><name>student-housing-covid-reminder</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>ACTION REQUIRED TODAY: Undergraduate, Graduate and Family Student Housing Tenants</title><summary>In order to dramatically and immediately reduce the density on campus, we strongly urge all students who can leave campus to do so by Sunday, March 29.

<p>You are receiving this message because we have still not heard from you regarding your residency intentions for spring. As stated in our previous messages on March 13 and <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/03/campus-housing-and-operations-update.html">March 17</a>, all residential students must complete one of the two forms below. As COVID&#8211;19 mitigation actions escalate across the country, our campus is making additional changes to our operations. In order to dramatically and immediately reduce the density on campus, we strongly urge all students who can leave campus to do so by Sunday, March 29. Travel to return to your permanent residence is encouraged and permissible.</p>
<p>While students may remain in residence this spring if they fall into one of the categories outlined below, there are operational impacts that will be experienced given COVID&#8211;19.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you intend to leave campus, complete the <a href="https://forms.gle/rrUd25b7DVb9oy5P8">Intent to Vacate form</a></strong> to indicate your intention to move-out of university housing.</li>
<li>Additionally, students who have already returned to their permanent residence and need to request an extension to remove their belongings at a later date should <strong>ALSO</strong> complete the <a href="https://forms.gle/rQT4rM6gsQiDYRDJ7">Late Checkout form</a>.</li>
<li>If you do not have an alternate safe housing option and <strong>must</strong> remain in university housing, complete the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4ON05ePawOPCyRSz0Z5DD8Q0T-X2LQj-gAMdoi97toIvJyg/viewform">Remain in Residence</a> form. See the below list of qualifying reasons to remain in housing.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are committed to supporting all of our students through this outbreak, especially those who must remain in housing. We want you to know the latest information, so that you can make an informed decision about your housing situation to the extent that you have choices.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are doing all we can to prevent the spread of COVID&#8211;19. However, the virus has already become so prevalent that public health authorities believe that if testing were more widely available, testing would reveal that many of us, including UCSC students and employees, have already been exposed to this virus.</li>
<li>The primary public health strategy is mitigation: reducing exposure by rigorous compliance with social distancing recommendations, regular handwashing andextra care to avoid unnecessary contact with our most vulnerable populations. This is most effective when followed by all of us as individuals. However, we want to prepare you for the reality that some people living in and supporting campus housing will inevitably become ill with COVID&#8211;19.</li>
<li>It is also inevitable that students who become sick with COVID&#8211;19 but are not ill enough to require hospitalization will need to self-isolate in campus residences. Students who are exposed to the virus before they realize it will be living in some proximity to students who are well, increasing the potential for the infection to spread.</li>
<li>We will need to close several of the residential buildings and relocate any students residing there, as well as adjust our housing and dining operations to improve social distancing. These decisions will be made once we have determined how many students have a need to remain in university housing.</li>
<li>Dining Services will be limited to take-out only meals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Students Moving Out of University Housing</h3>
<p>As stated in our original communication, if you complete your move-out by April 5, you will be eligible for a full refund of any housing and dining fees paid for spring quarter. This will also apply to students who need to request a Late Checkout because they are unable to retrieve their belongings and complete the move-out process at this time. Further, more recently we asked that students who can safely leave by Sunday, March 29, please do so. This will allow the remaining students who are not able to leave campus the recommended space for effective social distancing.</p>
<p>We will process cancellations and make adjustments to student accounts in the order in which the move-out process has been completed. We appreciate your patience during this time and advise that you closely monitor your university account (my.ucsc.edu) to see when your charges have been adjusted. Your account will not accrue a housing late fee while we work to process your adjustment.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will not be voiding housing guarantees for students who cancel their university housing for spring 2020. Therefore, if a student has a housing guarantee that extends beyond spring 2020, they will retain that guarantee as long as they apply during the April 13&#8211;20 Priority Housing Application Period.</p>
<h3>Students Planning to Remain in University Housing</h3>
<p>Students may remain in university housing during spring only if one or more of the following conditions apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not have access to alternate housing</li>
<li>Financial resources do not enable a return to their permanent residence</li>
<li>Personal health or safety considerations prohibit relocation</li>
<li>Permanent residence is in an area highly impacted by COVID&#8211;19</li>
<li>Permanent residence does not have, and cannot obtain the infrastructure needed to support remote learning</li>
<li>Other extenuating circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your patience and flexibility.</p>

UC Santa Cruz employees are permitted by these orders to continue to come to work to carry out the university's essential functions. We write to provide clarity regarding who should and should not be coming to work </span><strong>at all campus locations </strong><span>to perform duties related to remote instruction and research consistent with the procedures that the campus has now established for providing remote learning and essential research continuity. This directive supersedes all earlier communications.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Please read through the detailed information below.&#160;</span><strong>These are campus directives that everyone in our research and teaching communities must follow. They are not guidelines.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Coverage of this directive</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This message is a formal employment directive issued by the interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor, the Vice Chancellor for Business and Administrative Services, and the Vice Chancellor for Research, and it applies to all employees and faculty including visiting scholars and visiting student researchers who are engaged in instruction and research. This directive applies to research and instructional faculty, staff and students; it does not apply to administrators and managers whose presence on campus is otherwise determined to be essential.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Remote instruction&#160;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Faculty, graduate students (in their capacity as TAs and GSIs), and staff may come to the campus only to engage in and directly support the delivery of remote learning instruction (and the limited, specific preparation necessary for such instruction) that cannot be accomplished from home. </span><strong>We have suspended our Webcast service and it will not be available during the spring quarter. Classrooms will not be available for the preparation or execution of remote instruction.</strong><span> Instructors, teaching assistants, and the staff who support them in remote instruction may use private offices to access the internet for the purpose of delivery of remote learning. Access to, and the use of, private offices must conform to standards of social distancing.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In cases where remote instruction is possible only with the use of campus facilities, approval must be obtained from department chairs and the relevant dean. Please note that exemptions for use of specialized facilities will be limited to a small number of previously determined lab and studio courses. With the exception of private offices, all uses of campus facilities for the facilitation of remote instruction must be approved in advance and must incorporate mandated standards of social distancing. For approval, please contact your department chair, college provost or program director, who will facilitate approval with the dean.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As you make the change to fully remote instruction, first visit our </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585062242941000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFVo3W1kERXKYHb3oySmincDfsIfA" href="https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Keep Teaching</span></a><span> website to take advantage of the teaching resources, technical information and guidance, and virtual consultation services. Resources and consultation are available to support you as you transition to a fully remote environment. Group and individual consultation services can be scheduled by contacting </span><a href="mailto:citl@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>citl@ucsc.edu</span></a><span> or </span><a href="mailto:help@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>help@ucsc.edu</span></a><span>.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Research&#160;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Principal investigators (PIs) and their research groups/staff may only engage in essential on-campus research continuity activities with the specific approval of the Vice Chancellor for Research. </strong><span>See the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/03/temp-cessation-of-non-essential-on-campus-research-operations.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585062242941000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEaVpS-xUSS4KabgrZM2oomUyO3wQ" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/03/temp-cessation-of-non-essential-on-campus-research-operations.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>March 17 message</span></a><span> for further details. PIs will be notified about approvals on a rolling basis.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>No one supporting the campus research enterprise may come to campus for any purpose without approval, nor may approved researchers support or engage in activities that have not been explicitly approved by the VCR. If you are being inappropriately pressured to come to your workplace, contact your department chair, Scott Brandt, Vice Chancellor for Research (<a href="mailto:vcr@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vcr@ucsc.edu</a>), or Quentin Williams, acting Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies (<a href="mailto:qwilliam@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">qwilliam@ucsc.edu</a>).&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Classroom access</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Classrooms will be locked and remain locked through the spring quarter. Some buildings will be locked with access limited to key-card holders. Building managers will communicate information regarding building closure to occupants.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The campus will shift to having all facilities placed in after-hours security mode. This means that for all sites including the residential campus, Coastal Science Campus, Westside Research Park at 2300 Delaware, UCO-Lick at Mount Hamilton, Scotts Valley Center, and Silicon Valley Center, doors will be locked 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and access to the facility will be limited to those essential employees who require access and have key/electronic access. This action reflects the need to adequately secure the campus through the period of the county and state directive to shelter in place and may be extended for public safety purposes.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>When working from home has limitations</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Other than the exceptions listed above, no employee, graduate student or instructor supporting instruction or research may decide to come to their campus office to work. Beyond those work environment needs dictated by a responsibility to provide remote instruction, inadequate home internet or home conditions that are not conducive to efficient work are not allowed reasons to come to campus. The university understands that employees may not be able to work with normal efficiency during this period. Instructors and staff who need equipment to work from home should request support from their supervisor or department chair.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>A word of thanks</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We know that a number of changes have gone into effect quickly and during an already enormously stressful time. We want to thank you for your support and the considerable work of all members of our community that we know is going into making these transitions. These changes are designed to protect our community and to follow the new shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders, while maintaining the essential, critical functions of the university.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In these difficult times, as a public university all UC campuses are prioritizing our shared teaching mission. In putting the academic interests of our students first, we acknowledge the tradeoffs, and to the fullest extent possible we will address the consequences of making these decisions.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Please continue to support each other as we work through these challenging times. Be well.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz faculty, instructors, postdoctoral researchers, graduate students</audience><admin>Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer, Vice Chancellor, Research Scott Brandt, Vice Chancellor, Business and Administrative Services Sarah Latham</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0803c0d5807270177be99ccde3b6c57e"><name>covid-19-faq-working-with-staff-human-resources</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>COVID-19 FAQ Working with Staff Human Resources</title><summary>In light of the quantity and speed of changes affecting our campus community, Staff Human Resources has developed a page of FAQs to help all of us navigate SHR services and processes during this evolving situation.</summary><start-date>1584730860000</start-date><display-name>COVID-19 FAQ Working with Staff Human Resources</display-name><path>/2020/03/covid-19-faq-working-with-staff-human-resources</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/03/covid-19-faq-working-with-staff-human-resources</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1584977395897</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594752141385</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>Dear Colleagues,</span></p>

This action reflects the need to adequately secure the campus through the period of the county and state directive to shelter in place and may be extended for public safety purposes.&#160;</span></p>

The whirlwind we&#8217;ve been swept into over the past month has been both wholly unpredictable and staggering in its breadth. My hope is that spring break gives us all a chance to exhale, to take stock of the good things in our lives, and to focus on our future beyond COVID-19. Though we have some uncertainty about when that future will come into focus, I know we will get there and that our UCSC community will be more resilient as a result of the challenges we have overcome together.</p>
<p>The most obvious change for most of us is that we&#8217;ve had to step away from campus. Students will be learning remotely in the spring quarter, taught by faculty themselves testing new teaching methods. Many of our close-knit staff teams will be scattered, held together by email chains and Zoom conference calls rather than morning conversations around communal coffee makers. All this is hard, especially at a university so grounded in its sense of place. Our campus is one of the most beautiful, peaceful spots in the world &#8212; ironically the exact kind of place we need to be in stressful times like these.</p>
<p>To offer our community a bit of that campus calm, we&#8217;ll soon launch a video feature called the UCSC Minute. Look at it as your weekly 60 seconds of campus calm. We&#8217;re going to experiment in this spot over the quarter, looking for other ways to keep our campus community connected. Look for our popular Slug Stories on Instagram, tweaked just a bit to show how our Slugs are adapting to these changing times. We want to see our proud students in their new, temporary study habitats. Watch our Instagram feed for details on submitting pictures. We&#8217;ll also be seeking input on your favorite campus spots, for a still-developing photo feature.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll continue with our normal steady flow of stories profiling the creative folks who make up our community, and we&#8217;ll keep chronicling the achievements of our students, staff and faculty. You can also expect to find regular updates on the COVID-19 pandemic, with details on how Slugs are helping lead the fight against it. You&#8217;ll hear from me on occasion, and from other campus leaders, too. Equally important, though, we&#8217;ll want your voices &#8212; students, staff and faculty. If there&#8217;s anything we must keep in mind right now, it&#8217;s that we are all in this together.</p>
<p>In that vein, I&#8217;d like to note the incredible compassion and cooperation I&#8217;ve seen demonstrated by so many of you over the past month. Our faculty have jumped feet-first into the challenge of remote teaching. Our students have taken massive life changes in stride. Our staff have shown incredible resiliency, a willingness to roll up their sleeves and to try new ways of doing business. I am grateful for all of you and reminded that crises, while unwelcome, also have the ability to bring out the best in people. That&#8217;s certainly what I&#8217;ve seen on our campus.</p>
<p>As we move toward the start of the spring quarter, it&#8217;s important that we remain patient, grounded in the understanding that we&#8217;re together in uncharted waters. Please stay active and engaged and unplug when you need to. Take that daily walk or continue to be active in other ways. Remember that this is all temporary, and that campus will soon be fully alive again. Until that time, we will continue to create community in other ways.

<p>There were no good-bye hugs as the campus community made a major pivot to remote education for spring quarter to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. As finals week wrapped up, more than 6,800 students had indicated that they plan to move off campus for spring. Another 1,300 told housing officials they planned to remain in campus housing. Housing officials anticipate relocating some students to further increase social distancing.</p>
<p>In the midst of this unprecedented disruption, signs of spring were everywhere: cherry blossoms, flowering wild iris, and the periwinkle sparkles of hound&#8217;s tongue. Deer grazed the meadows and wild turkeys stopped traffic, familiar hallmarks of the campus and reminders of the enduring rhythms of the natural world.</p>

<h3>Fake employers</h3>
<p>The scammers send you an email to your school email address, encouraging you to apply for a job. The message appears to come from a campus job-placement office, student services department, or a professor. The position &#8212; ranging from pet sitting to secret shopping &#8212; sounds ideal. The work is easy, has flexible hours, and pays well.</p>
<p>When you reply, the &#8220;employer&#8221; hires you without an interview. You are sent a check with instructions to deposit it before you&#8217;ve done any work. You are instructed to use this money to purchase gift cards, money orders or other supplies you&#8217;ll need for the job. You are asked to send part of what you purchase to the new employer. The rest of the money will be your payment. However, the check is fake, which banks will discover shortly after you deposit it. Any money already sent to your &#8220;employer&#8221; is gone.</p>
<h3>How to avoid employment scams</h3>
<p>Do your research. Before saying yes to any job, research the company. Does it have a professional website and legitimate contact information? What are others saying about their experience with the company?</p>
<p>Beware of red flags. Scammers often send emails with typos and grammatical errors. They offer to hire you without an interview and even pay you before you&#8217;ve done any work. None of these are behaviors of a reputable business.</p>
<p>Never send funds in the form of cash, checks, gift cards or wire transfers to someone you don&#8217;t know. Legitimate companies would never request this.</p>

She also aims to identify and assess future options for flood protection in other areas of the San Francisco Bay. The resulting data will be used to quantify the economic value of preserving these coastal habitats, which can aid future coastal planning in San Francisco and the broader west coast. As coastal California communities continue to seek effective and affordable solutions for coastal resilience, such models and data will be beneficial in suggesting guidelines for successful flood reduction solutions.</span></span></span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://caseagrant.ucsd.edu/news/new-research-to-support-sustainable-aquaculture-and-resilient-coastal-communities</url><title>California Sea Grant announcement</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="13867c57807270174e35fdbd866c03db"><name>helmuth-sciam</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumna Laura Helmuth appointed editor-in-chief of 'Scientific American'</title><summary>Laura Helmuth, a graduate of the UC Santa Cruz Science Communication Program, has been named the new editor-in-chief of 'Scientific American'.</summary><start-date>1585119600000</start-date><display-name>Alumna Laura Helmuth appointed editor-in-chief of Scientific American</display-name><path>/2020/03/helmuth-sciam</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/03/helmuth-sciam</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1585170512957</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1585433962844</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Science Communication Program</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/03/images/laura-helmuth-200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/03/images/laura-helmuth-200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>laura-helmuth-200.jpg</name><display-name>laura-helmuth-200.jpg</display-name><file-size>39610</file-size><width>200</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt>Laura Helmuth</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/03/images/laura-helmuth-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/03/images/laura-helmuth-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>laura-helmuth-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>laura-helmuth-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23135</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Laura Helmuth</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Laura Helmuth</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Laura Helmuth, a graduate of the UC Santa Cruz Science Communication Program, has been named the new editor-in-chief of </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Scientific American</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">.

<p>Martin, manager of the Alan Chadwick Garden, coauthored <em>Fruit Trees for Every Garden: An Organic Approach to Growing Apples, Pears, Peaches, Plums, Citrus, and More </em>with Manjula Martin.</p>
<p>The book was recognized for its detailed information and described by one judge as &#8220;a no-nonsense guide for beginning fruit tree growers using the French intensive method of the late Alan Chadwick.&#8221; Another judge noted the authors&#8217; overall expertise but singled out the extensive pruning section for high praise, which brought Martin particular joy, because he said it was a difficult section to write&#8212;"and even more difficult to negotiate with the editor."</p>

The fellowship provides up to $375,000 of support for independent research over three years, as well as other benefits including an annual summit to develop professional networks, exchange information and ideas, and foster collaboration.<br/><br/>In her research at UC Santa Cruz, Bailey aims to integrate a growing body of exoplanet data into a cohesive picture to contextualize the foundations of our solar system. <br/><br/>As a theorist, Bailey addresses broad questions about the nature of planetary systems. Her doctoral research has focused on the formation of &#8220;hot Jupiters,&#8221; a class of gas giant exoplanets that orbit astonishingly close to their host stars. In her postdoctoral fellowship, she plans to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding observations of distant planetary systems that contain hot Jupiters and other closely orbiting planets. She will also critically examine why our own solar system lacks such planets. Her work will help determine which exoplanets could be habitable and explain how the solar system&#8217;s planets relate to these seemingly alien worlds.<br/><br/>&#8220;We know our early solar system was an efficient planet production environment, but it completely lacks the types of planets Kepler has observed in many other systems. Discovering more about planets unique from our own will help us understand our place in the galactic context,&#8221; said Bailey, who is currently a Ph.D. candidate in planetary science at the California Institute of Technology.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="17b043f5807270174e35fdbd9cd30c8e"><name>sarker-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>California Sea Grant funds sustainable aquaculture project</title><summary>Pallab Sarker, an associate research professor in environmental studies, has received support from the Coastal Sea Grant program to fund his research into the development of sustainable feed for farmed fish.</summary><keywords>aquaculture, sustainability, trout, fish</keywords><start-date>1585206000000</start-date><display-name>Sarker-Grant</display-name><path>/2020/03/sarker-grant</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/03/sarker-grant</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1585240359893</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1585689049878</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/03/images/sarker_400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/03/images/sarker_400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sarker_400.jpg</name><display-name>sarker_400.jpg</display-name><file-size>132705</file-size><width>800</width><height>502</height></image><image-alt>Pallab Sarker in an aquaculture lab</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/03/sarker_80_3.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/03/sarker_80_3.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sarker_80_3.jpg</name><display-name>sarker_80_3.jpg</display-name><file-size>4737</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Pallab Sarker in an aquaculture lab</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Pallab Sarker is developing sustainable feed for farm-raised fish. (Photo by Devin Fitzgerald)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Pallab Sarker, an associate research professor in environmental studies, has received support from the Coastal Sea Grant program to fund his research into the development of <a href="https://caseagrant.ucsd.edu/project/converting-under-utilized-microalgal-co-product-into-value-added-ingredient-for-cost-viable">sustainable feed for farmed fish</a>.</p>
<p>Sarker is one of 19 recipients of grants announced this week by <a href="https://caseagrant.ucsd.edu/">California Sea Grant</a>, a partnership of the federal government, the state of California, and universities that aims to create knowledge and develop products and services that benefit the economy, the environment, and the public. The program provided a total of $900,000 to support projects focused on aquaculture and resilient coastal communities over the next year or two.</p>
<p>Sarker received nearly $120,000 for an aquaculture project that is focused on developing cost-effective, <a href="https://caseagrant.ucsd.edu/project/converting-under-utilized-microalgal-co-product-into-value-added-ingredient-for-cost-viable">fish-free feed for farm-raised rainbow trout</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The results of this research will advance what we know about the nutritional value and economic feasibility of environmentally sustainable aquaculture feed, a key factor for the growth of the aquaculture industry," said Sarker.</p>
<p>The growing demand for farmed fish is creating a need for <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/09/kapuscinski-noaa.html">sustainable feed</a>. Current feeds rely too heavily on fishmeal and fish oil from small, wild fish like anchovies and sardines, putting those populations in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Sarker is collaborating with environmental studies professor Anne Kapuscinski, co-PI on the grant, to develop a new protein meal to feed farmed trout. Their formula utilizes microalgal biomass left over from the oil extraction process used to produce omega-3 oils for human consumption. That biomass is mixed with other omega 3-rich marine microalga to fully replace fishmeal and fish oil in rainbow trout aquafeeds, resulting in an entirely fish-free feed.</p>
<p>The grant will support development of the new processed microalgal protein, as well as analysis of trout growth, water-pollution consequences, and the economic viability of the experimental feeds.</p>
<p>The goal is to develop a more environmentally sustainable, cost effective method to feed farmed trout, while also potentially improving the nutritional values of the fish. The results will be shared with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, private and public trout-farming facilities, and at conferences.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of interest nationally in aquaculture and growing the nation&#8217;s ocean-based economy,&#8221; said California Sea Grant Director Shauna Oh. &#8220;The new projects funded through this call continue the program&#8217;s focus on sustainable aquaculture, including aquaculture to restore endangered populations, seaweed farming and outreach, as well as research that can inform development of an environmentally friendly aquaculture industry in California.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hastings received the support from METER Group, Inc., a Washington-based company that manufactures precision instruments for use in environmental science, food quality assurance, and geotechnology.</p>
<p>METER is supplying Hastings with several instruments that will support <a href="https://www.metergroup.com/company/grant-harris-fellowship/grant-a-harris-fellowship-2020-recipients/">his investigation</a> of water storage in the tissues of the iconic trees, yearly fluctuations in water storage, and the development of an integrated model of Joshua tree anatomy that simulates the plants responses to different climate conditions. Climate change is expected to reduce Joshua trees to 10% of their current range due to increased temperatures and more frequent drought.</p>
<p>Hastings plans to use the data he gathers to model future Joshua tree distributions, inform conservation planning and assisted migration efforts, and improve understanding of ecohydrology in the Mojave Desert.</p>
<p>METER established the Grant A. Harris Fellowship to support innovation by recognizing graduate students who are contributing to agricultural, environmental, or geotechnical science.&#160;Each winner receives $10,000 of METER scientific instrumentation for use in their research.</p>

The student lives off campus and has been self-isolating since being tested. The student was last on campus March 16 and is doing well.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are coordinating closely with local public health officials and following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and California Department of Public Health (CDPH) guidance in responding to this case. Student Health Services and Office of Emergency Services personnel are working with public health officials to determine whether there are members of the campus community who may have had significant exposure to this individual and who may subsequently have an increased risk of developing COVID-19. Public health officials will determine specific actions that may be needed, such as self-quarantine.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The health and well-being of our campus community is our top priority. The campus is ensuring that this student is getting the care and support that they need. Student Health Services and Office of Emergency Services personnel continue to proactively identify individuals with potential COVID-19 exposure and request that they self-quarantine to protect our community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Students, faculty, and staff should stay home and call their health care provider if they have symptoms of respiratory illness, especially fever and cough. The CDC&#8217;s </strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/index.html"><strong>coronavirus self-checker is a good tool</strong></a><strong> to help you determine what next steps should be taken.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>What students should do</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students, whether on campus, off campus in Santa Cruz, or at their permanent residence, can call the Student Health Center at 831-459-2591 for instructions on self-care or to make a telehealth or in-person appointment. Information about </span><a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/forms/student-handbook/HC-816-After-Hours-Care-Info-Sheet.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">after-hours care for students is available online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Acutely ill students who are not in Santa Cruz should seek medical care from a healthcare provider in their area.</span></p>
<p><strong>If you are a student who received care off-campus and have tested positive, or if you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, please notify the Student Health Center at 831-459-2591 so that we can help coordinate your care and support the health of our campus community.</span></p>
<h3><strong>What employees should do</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees should seek medical care through their regular health care providers. If you have tested positive for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone who tested positive, please email your supervisor and the Office of Emergency Services (Lisa Ehret, director) at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">oes@ucsc.edu</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Where you can find updates and additional information</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 situation is dynamic, which means guidance from public health officials and the CDC changes frequently. The </span><a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/coronavirus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 campus website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is being updated regularly with the latest information, including the number of confirmed cases in Santa Cruz County and our campus community. Notification about additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 within our campus community will be based on guidance from public health officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We appreciate everyone&#8217;s cooperation and patience during this challenging time.&#160;</span></p>

<p>In this time when we are distanced from each other that&#8217;s an important idea. We won&#8217;t be working in the same space, but we can still be a team together. Distancing does mean however, that we have to shift our work practices in some critical work areas.</p>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s over-communicate. We can&#8217;t look across the table to check for understanding, or watch each other for nonverbal cues. So let&#8217;s use our words carefully, overshare information and documents, and do so in advance of any meeting or discussion. Speak slowly and clearly when you are working online, to minimize confusion and technical glitches. Be mindful of turn-taking.</p>
<p>A helpful suggestion for continuous communication is adding an informal channel like Google Hangouts, group texting or Slack, which also allows easy document sharing.</p>
<h3>Delegation</h3>
<p>When our teams work together, work is delegated according to capacity, or skill sets. As each team member contributes their work towards our organizational goals, tracking and checking in on progress can no longer be accomplished through standing meetings, or hallway chats. The informal talk of our organization is ubiquitous in its role of moving projects forward, and this can create gaps in our communication. One solution is to generate simple project spreadsheets that can be shared among team members, detailing tasks, interim and final deadlines, the team member responsible for moving the task forward, and most importantly, a notes section allowing team members to keep their progress, challenges and successes updated. Project task lists work best for time-bound, discreet projects. For coordinating more complex work, project management tools are abundant.</p>
<h3>Efficiency</h3>
<p>A word about the tools we&#8217;re using. While we have a plethora of choices in selecting tools, it is important that we make deliberate decisions about what type of content is appropriate for each. We don&#8217;t want to confuse the flow of information, or make more work trying to track down the information we need.</p>
<p>Other efficiencies in team communication can be generated by more frequent, shorter meetings to lessen the sense of isolation among team members, and provide opportunities to bring up and address issues. Always end meetings with a plan for business continuity&#8211;for action items, and next steps.</p>
<h3>Ideas</h3>
<p>Ideas may be the hardest hit area of distributed workforces. Because team synergy is responsible for so much idea generation, with team members building on each other&#8217;s ideas, we have to nurture the opportunity for creative thinking. Many of our teams designate a note-taker, and this is an opportunity to capture the seeds of an idea, and assign it to a team member to grow and shepherd it to the next meeting by doing research, looking for vendors, putting costs together, etc.</p>
<h3>Support</h3>
<p>Take time with each other. Time for thanks, for kudos, and to celebrate successes. Time to drop a quick note, share a joke or congratulate a team member on a life event. Some of our team members may be experiencing ancillary stress during this difficult time, and any support we can provide could go a long way to reminding them that they are valued as individuals and contributors. If you see someone struggling, help them find the appropriate campus resources in your unit, or through Staff Human Resources.</p>
<h3>Negativity</h3>
<p>Despite some of the advantages of working remotely (e.g., a better commute!) working alone has many challenges. When one of your team has negative feelings, and expresses them, take the opportunity to acknowledge their workplace values, and take action towards healthy change. As an example, a colleague who is complaining about how awkward online meetings can be might be expressing their commitment to good communication. Perhaps that team member can even take the opportunity to propose action, and develop some guidelines around team communication.</p>
<h3>Online Meeting Etiquette</h3>
<p>To get the most out of every remote meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be prepared for video</strong>: Press the &#8220;start video&#8221; button. Go ahead. Few of us love the way we look online. But giving someone what nonverbal cues you can, and being present and engaged will bring us all closer together.</li>
<li><strong>Stick to your meeting schedule:</strong> Online work can be less formal by nature, so please respect the start and end times of your meeting as a courtesy to others.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t multitask while online:</strong> Checking your phone, answering emails and reading docs are all important, but will distract you from the business at hand. Give your participants the courtesy of your full attention.</li>
<li><strong>Minimize distractions:</strong> If you work in a space that has ambient noise, or other people who are working remotely, consider using earbuds or headphones to help you stay focused. You may or may not have a private space to work, so take a moment to let others know if you need quiet for a meeting. Encourage them to do the same.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on the business at hand, stay professional:</strong> Mute your phone, close unnecessary windows on your computer, and point your screen away from the bobbing chicken clock you have up on your wall. Make the meeting environment as professional as you can. That said, the kids are at home&#8211;be flexible.</li>
<li>Remember to provide a recap before terminating your meeting, and follow up with minutes, action items, assigned tasks and next steps.</li>
<li>Please do leave some grace for miscommunication, stress, or technology issues.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Best Practices</h3>
<p>Remote work is more than meetings, so here are a handful of tips that can be helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Honor a start and end time to your day if possible, and take lunches and breaks.</li>
<li>Take time to stretch.</li>
<li>Be mindful of screen time, refocus often.</li>
<li>If possible, leave your laptop in a dedicated work space, and work in the same place as often as you can.</li>
<li>Remain visible and available to your team and supervisor, and let them know if you need to meet.</li>
<li>Keep your calendar up to date!</li>
<li>Take time for process checks and post-mortems on key projects so that we can continue to improve our remote work habits</li>
<li>Celebrate the team&#8217;s successes</li>
<li>Schedule time for socializing in your meeting: check-in with each other</li>
<li>If possible schedule time for learning. Spring classes will be available soon at learn.ucsc.edu!</li>
<li>Be mindful of your health and take care of yourself and others.</li>

<p>You are receiving this message because you indicated the need for a Late Checkout to remove your belongings from your university residence and complete the move-out process. We are writing to urge you to promptly complete your move-out as soon as you are able to do so.</p>
<p align="left">Your belongings are occupying a space that is now greatly needed. In order to accommodate students who must remain on campus, while providing appropriate physical distancing, we will be relocating hundreds of students on campus to new rooms. We also want to ensure that you are able to remove your belongings from your residence before these spaces may be utilized for other purposes, including potential isolation or quarantine housing.</p>
<p align="left">Due to the rapidly evolving needs of our campus, we are setting a<span>&#160;</span><strong>firm deadline of April 19 for students who requested a late checkout to completely vacate their spaces</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li align="left">If your requested checkout date is earlier than this date, then please plan to vacate according to your earlier scheduled date.</li>
<li align="left">If your requested checkout date was later than this date, then you will need to take action to comply. If you are unable to retrieve your belongings by that date, consider contracting with a personal moving service to pack your belongings and ship them to you. Many services are available, and focus on university students who need their rooms packed and their belongings shipped or stored. One option for shipping and/or storage of your belongings is<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dormbox.co/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585671308284000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGaVAwDdIyyUhOzYRviMkIVQomB2Q" href="https://www.dormbox.co/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dormbox*</a>, though there are other similar moving companies and you are encouraged to research your options.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">As stated in our previous communication, students who complete their move-out (i.e. remove all belongings and return any university keys) by April 5 will be eligible for a full refund of any housing and dining fees paid for spring quarter. We will continue to offer full spring quarter housing refunds to students who complete their move-out by April 19. We will not be able to process any adjustment to your university account until you have completed the move-out process.</p>
<p align="left">Anyone who is still in residence after April 19 should plan to be reassigned to a new residential location. Additionally, anyone who is still in residence after this date, or whose belongings remain in residence, will be subject to a prorated housing charge from the start of the quarter to the date their move-out is completed. If necessary, students may also be subject to an additional fee of up to $500 to have belongings packed and shipped.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Office of Equity &amp; Equal Protection will be responsible for the administration of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s policies and procedures regarding discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, religion, disability, sex, gender, age and other protected identities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reorganization of existing compliance resources into a new unit is FTE neutral and is intended to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">streamline processes for students, staff and faculty who may have a complaint or grievance, shifting the burden of wayfinding from individuals to the institution. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">EEP will</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help complainants identify and enter the appropriate process more quickly, provide effective case management, and serve as a resource for the entire campus community on issues of harassment and discrimination.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EEP will be led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">current Title IX Director Isabel Alvarado Dees, who will serve as interim Associate Vice Chancellor of Equity and Equal Protection and report&#160; to the chancellor. The AVC-EEP will hold plenary titles for the multiple areas reporting to the office including Title IX Coordinator, Locally Designated Officer (LDO), ADA Coordinator, and Equal Employment and Opportunity (EEO) Director.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the scope of authority and jurisdiction of the Title IX Office will be restored to include responsibility for campus Title VI compliance (previously known as the Harassment, Discrimination, Prevention, Investigation Unit) and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the EEO Director will take responsibility for student employment-discrimintation complaints, a function that previously resided in the Career Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will conduct a preliminary review of this new organizational structure in December 2020 to evaluate effectiveness and determine the next steps for hiring a permanent AVC-EEP. I thank the many members of our community who have already provided input on this reorganization. I look forward to future engagement as we work to improve access and equity for all students, staff, and faculty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also write to express my gratitude to AVC Jean Marie Scott for serving at the LDO since July 1 and to Special Assistant Bill Kidder for supporting LDO and ADA functions as we developed the structure for this new organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this time, interim AVC Teresa Maria Linda Scholz has overseen the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (ODEI) including the Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity functions since July 1. She has been central to rethinking our campus needs and developing this new unit. Interim AVC Scholz will partner closely with EEP and continue to lead ODEI and the </span><a href="https://reporthate.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hate/Bias Response Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and I am very grateful for her willingness to take on and help transform these crucial functions over the past eight months.</span></p>

He is seeing patients sick with COVID-19 at a busy Baltimore hospital, and doesn&#8217;t want to bring the virus back to his house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am exposed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I am exposed. I wear my equipment to minimize being infected but I see people with this disease and don&#8217;t want to share that with my family. You hear stories of physicians who literally strip outside [their homes] so they can come in and go right into the shower.&#8221; <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Hirshon&#8217;s wife and two of his three daughters live with him. Hirshon simply avoids them as much as he can, taking his meals and showers downstairs in a basement studio. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I stay away. Most of the time, I stay in the basement, with a separate entrance that I go in and out from. I don&#8217;t have a kitchen, but I have a shower, a sink, a bathroom, a bed, a coffee maker, and a microwave," said Hirshon. "I have enough down there to keep myself reasonably comfortable, except for the important personal connections.&#8221;&#160; <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This living arrangement is isolating, but if he wants to provide front-line care without endangering loved ones, there is no other choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, Hirshon drives through nearly deserted Baltimore streets in the dead of night to take the graveyard shift at his hospital, where he cares for frightened and very sick patients while wearing a mask, a face shield, and a gown, or perhaps a full helmet with a battery powered air blower known as a PAPR. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is the life of an emergency doctor fighting COVID-19 in a large metropolitan area that is just starting to feel the brunt of coronavirus. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, 18 people in Maryland have died of COVID-19, a highly contagious viral infection that attacks the respiratory system. There are now more than 1,600 reported cases statewide. One nursing home has 66 COVID-19 cases, with 11 hospitalizations. The National Guard and FEMA have teamed up to turn the Baltimore Convention Center into a sprawling field hospital with 250 beds. This makeshift center is set to open April 24. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;As cases surge in Maryland, Hirshon and his colleagues must risk their lives to give patients the best possible care, in spite of severely limited access to coronavirus testing. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every day on the job is a battle,&#8221; said Hirshon, a professor of emergency care and epidemiology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. He was appointed a month ago as the interim chief of emergency medicine at the Baltimore Veterans Administration Medical Center. He is also the chair of the board of directors for the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), helping to guide his colleagues during these difficult times. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With this pandemic, things are changing on an almost daily basis,&#8221; Hirshon said. &#8220;If you are going into battle, do you think about winning the war? Does that comfort you? Or are you looking at the battle in front of you? We will get through this, no question, but the battles ahead require 110 percent determination, effort, and attention.&#8221; <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, the federal government declared Maryland a major disaster area. Maryland&#8217;s governor, Larry Hogan, announced his intention to add 6,000 hospital beds across the state. On March 30, he announced a total lock down of all but essential businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 crisis has exposed the high cost, weakness, inequity, and fragmentation of health care in the United States. Already stressed hospitals are now struggling, in large part because of decades of under-resourcing and lean budgets, Hirshon said. With tight margins and lack of support, over the years hospitals have cut staff and trimmed resources, while at the same time insurance companies are now making record profits. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of this lack of preparedness, and an inadequate national initial response to the pandemic, it is essential that all Americans support doctors, nurses, paramedics, and others in the medical field, so that they all receive the protective equipment and support they need, Hirshon said. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hirshon is on call 24/7 during the crisis. Each week, he has been working between 24 and 32 clinical hours giving emergency care, while putting in another 30 or 40 hours of administrative time. The patients he sees are severely ill, with great difficulty breathing, and often with high fevers. Many are understandably fearful. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need to address the pandemic of fear along with the coronavirus pandemic,&#8221; Hirshon said. &#8220;We live in a society where we feel we have some control. Now many feel they have lost the control.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coronavirus brings out our fear of losing control because of its cruel inconsistency, leaving one patient asymptomatic and others fighting for their lives. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hospitals across the nation have been grappling with severe and systemic shortages of equipment. So far, Hirshon&#8217;s hospital has the masks and materials it needs, but the future is uncertain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The preparedness at my hospital, and throughout the University of Maryland Medical System, is great. However, we are right at the inflection point,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you ask me the same question a week from now, my answers may be different."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the testing capacity for COVID-19 is severely limited.&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve had tests for people who were sick, who were being admitted to the ICU, but not for outpatients who were not particularly ill,&#8221; Hirshon said. In this respect, Baltimore is right in line with the rest of the country.&#160;</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His patient visits are similar to what happens in any emergency department situation, but in this case, there is a much higher degree of vigilance and care regarding exposure. Everyone who enters the room must wear a mask and gown. Sometimes Hirshon wears a protective suit with a hood and a mask that has a specially designed ventilation system to prevent him from breathing in aerosolized droplets. Still, his job puts him and his colleagues at serious risk. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you are over 60, as I am, you are not required to do this work,&#8221; Hirshon said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had colleagues who feel so uncomfortable, they&#8217;ve stepped away from it, and someone else who has significant anxiety. But I&#8217;m comfortable with risk taking. As the senior vice chair of our Institutional Review Board, I analyze research protocols with a specific focus on the risks/benefits of the research. I think of them all the time. Is my wife happy with me? No. But I went into medicine 30 years ago to take care of patients.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He takes a long view about the risk factor, looking back at the history of medicine. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A hundred years ago, when doctors put themselves at risk, they did not have access to antibiotics," he said. "Now there is risk again, but my job is to provide the best care I can.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Americans who are sheltering at home want to know what they can do to help people like Hirshon, and give assistance to the countless nurses, paramedics, and support staff that are putting themselves in harm&#8217;s way as the coronavirus spreads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Hirshon said: &#8220;Wash your hands. Stay home. A lot of people want to help. Some are sewing [safety masks], though I don&#8217;t know how good the quality will be. It&#8217;s important to reach out to local hospitals and see if they have needs. Reach out to the California chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians and ask what is needed.&#8221;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To celebrate the work of his colleagues on the front lines, Hirshon has been emailing friends and acquaintances a cartoon showing Superman and a pantheon of grim-faced superheroes addressing a befuddled-looking doctor wearing a white hospital gown and a stethoscope. &#8220;Welcome to the club,&#8221; Superman says.&#160;</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beneath this lighthearted drawing lies a darker reality. Superman is all but invincible, but front-line providers are in serious danger. Already, several emergency doctors across the nation have tested positive for the coronavirus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are emergency physicians integrated at hospitals where people are sick and in ICUs and intubated&#8212;and some of them may be my friends. I have people I work with who have tested positive. I have colleagues in New York and New Jersey and Washington state, which have all experienced devastating COVID-19 surges," he said.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am honored to be able to help patients and their families every day that I work in the emergency department, and to help my colleagues and our society through the work I do through my professional society, ACEP,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he and his colleagues recognize the danger that doctors face around the world when helping patients with COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is not something we talk about, but I have to acknowledge that some of my friends may die in this, and that is a very real risk.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/03/images/jon-mark-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/03/images/jon-mark-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jon-mark-featured.jpg</name><file-size>8669</file-size><width>400</width><height>192</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Jon Mark Hirshon</thumb-alt><title>Jon Mark Hirshon: On the front lines of COVID-19</title><description>Alumnus Jon Mark Hirshon, an emergency physician, faces isolation and personal risk while providing emergency care at a busy Baltimore hospital.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="31b5d0ea807270174e35fdbd0dea5e34"><name>shr-talent-management</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>SHR announces tentative timeline for Talent Acquisition Management system</title><summary>SHR announces tentative timeline for Talent Acquisition Management system.</summary><start-date>1585638000000</start-date><display-name>SHR announces tentative timeline for Talent Acquisition Management system</display-name><path>/2020/03/shr-talent-management</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/03/shr-talent-management</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1585676931278</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1585676931278</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear UCSC Staff,&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Staff Human Resources Talent Acquisition department prepares for the launch of TAM, UCPath&#8217;s new recruitment module, we wanted to reach out to the campus to share the tentative timeline for the TAM rollout, as well as some changes resulting from TAM implementation.</span></p>
<h3><strong>TAM Cutover Timeline</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talent Acquisition plans to limit the number of job openings that are copied from RMS into TAM to job openings that are for continuous recruitments. Any job opening that is not a part of a continuous recruitment effort must either be completed in RMS or held until the launch of TAM. With this in mind, here is the cutover timeline for RMS and TAM:</span></p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4/30/20:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The last date for a job opening to be posted in RMS is 4/30. This allows for a two-week posting period before an initial review date (IRD) of 5/14. If the hiring manager would like more than a two-week posting period before the IRD passes, the job must be posted earlier than 4/30 so that the IRD is no later than 5/14.&#160;</span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>5/14/20:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The last possible IRD for a job opening in RMS will be 5/14. Any job opening requiring an IRD later than 5/14 will need to be held until it can be posted in TAM.&#160;</span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>6/1/20:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">TAM launches!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In accordance with this timeline, there will be an effective blackout period for posting new job openings during the month of May. We hope that by communicating this timeline to the campus now, departments can plan accordingly to minimize disruption within their departments.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that while there is a blackout period for posting new job openings in RMS, there is no such blackout period for planning and requesting new job openings for June. Talent Acquisition will continue to receive and process new job opening requests throughout the month of May so that they are ready to go when TAM launches on June 1st. Likewise, there is no blackout period whatsoever related to job offer activity and TA will continue to extend job offers and start new employees during the month of May.</span></p>
<h3><strong>ServiceNow Job Opening Request Form</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting in June, the RMS Worksheets will be retired, to be replaced by a new Job Opening Request form in ServiceNow. This new form will offer all of the same functionality currently handled by all of the current RMS Worksheets, including competitive recruitments (open recruitments and campus-only recruitments), non-recruitments, waivers of recruitments, and job offers. As of June, ServiceNow will be the main interface through which the campus will interact with the TAM module in UCPath.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>The New Recruitment Document Suite</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside the launch of TAM and the new Job Opening Request form in ServiceNow, we will also be rolling out a new Recruitment Document Suite using Google Drive. The Recruitment Document Suite contains a number of familiar (yet updated) documents, including screening matrixes and recruitment selection logs that will help hiring managers and hiring committees throughout the recruitment process.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Where to Apply for Jobs</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of June 1st, there will be two different portals through which applicants can apply to staff jobs. For current employees, they will access job postings through UCPath in the Internal Candidate Gateway. For non-employees, they will access job postings through an External Candidate Gateway, which will be accessible through jobs.ucsc.edu.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Where to Get Support</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any questions about the RMS/TAM cutover timeline, the new ServiceNow Job Opening Request form, the Recruitment Document Suite, or the two Candidate Gateways, please don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out to us for help. The fastest way to get help is to email </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shrhelp@ucsc.edu</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

(Peggy) Delaney has announced that she will retire at the end of the academic year.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, Peggy has led Planning and Budget, an office that touches every part of campus and is vital in helping campus leaders develop strategies to achieve our priorities. Peggy&#8217;s leadership was essential in the purchase of the building that serves as the centerpiece of our Silicon Valley Campus, our long-term lease of the Scotts Valley Center, and countless projects that have helped to expand and maintain our campus. She has been a strong advocate for critical campus needs. She is a creative, committed campus leader who believes deeply in our mission. I wish her a happy retirement, and I will miss her greatly as a colleague.</p>
<p>Peggy is currently on leave. Kimberly Register, our director of budget and resource management, is overseeing division operations. Over the coming months, we will be examining the structure of the office, and a fuller transition plan will be announced later this academic year.</p>
<p>Prior to becoming a full-time campus administrator in 2009, Peggy was a professor in the department of ocean sciences, arriving on campus in 1983. She served two terms as department chair. She also served as interim campus provost and executive vice chancellor in 2004-2005.</p>
<p>Peggy has received several awards for innovation and excellence in teaching, including the Outstanding Educator Award from the Association for Women Geoscientists. Her research also has been honored, most notably by her election as a fellow of The Oceanography Society and of the American Geophysical Union, an honor reserved for a select group of scientists who have demonstrated eminence in a branch of the geophysical sciences.</p>
<p>Peggy earned her doctorate in chemical oceanography from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program. She earned her bachelor&#8217;s in chemistry from Yale University.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="32c14d27807270174e35fdbd9244955b"><name>supporting-student-employees-during-period-of-covid-19</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Supporting student employees during period of COVID-19</title><summary>COVID-19 has created unprecedented challenges for us.

<p dir="ltr"><span>COVID-19 has created unprecedented challenges for us. Among those many challenges is the question of whether and how we can continue to employ students. I&#8217;m writing with thoughts related to this question.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For many students, whether they are eligible for work-study or not, a campus-paid job is part of their financial aid plan. The prospect of losing income now because of COVID-19 could create hardship, possibly even endangering their ability to continue as students. I have already heard from students who are deeply concerned over the possible loss of income, and who starting spring quarter may be unable to pay for rent and buy groceries. Obviously, challenges like this disproportionately affect our students who are historically underserved, a barrier to our goal of equity of outcomes.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In addition to sustaining a student financially, employment is also a key part of the student experience, engaging them and contributing to student professional development. Now more than ever, continuing to provide engagement and developmental experiences would be helpful to our students.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For all of these reasons, for those of you who have been employing students, I encourage you to continue doing so to the fullest extent possible during this period of COVID-19.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>There are many ways of employing students even remotely. Students can complete special assignments, projects, or job-related reading or training. Now could be a great time to catch up on projects and tasks that we often delay because of our busy work days. I encourage you to be creative in offering work to our students to help mitigate the impact of losing income. Our FAQ page on student employment (see below) offers more ideas. (Please note, however: students should not be assigned work or hired into positions that would otherwise be completed by career employees if career employees need additional hours to fulfill their appointment percentages.)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We recognize that you may have many questions about hiring students given our new realities. For example, can Work Study students be employed remotely? Answer: Yes! To help you get answers, we have created </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://careers.ucsc.edu/student/jobs-internships/student-employment/student-co19-faq.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585779657067000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGxgLqwVVFQgTk5ds6MF_sFX7gSiA" href="https://careers.ucsc.edu/student/jobs-internships/student-employment/student-co19-faq.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>this FAQ page</span></a><span>. We will continue to improve it, and we welcome your feedback on it.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Thanks for everything you&#8217;re doing to support our students.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Staff and Faculty</audience><admin>Vice Provost Student Success Jaye Padgett</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3c95205e807270174e35fdbd01788871"><name>notice-of-mandatory-housing-relocation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Notice of Mandatory Housing Relocation</title><summary>In response to COVID-19, UC Santa Cruz has taken steps to dramatically and immediately reduce the number of people living on campus.</summary><start-date>1585465200000</start-date><display-name>Notice of Mandatory Housing Relocation</display-name><path>/2020/03/notice-of-mandatory-housing-relocation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/03/notice-of-mandatory-housing-relocation</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1585859338308</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594752390745</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p align="left">In response to COVID-19, UC Santa Cruz has taken steps to dramatically and immediately reduce the number of people living on campus. Students who can return to a permanent address or make alternate housing arrangements have been encouraged to leave campus. However, we understand that leaving campus may not be an option for everyone and we are committed to supporting our students through this outbreak.</p>
<p align="left">In order to focus our staffing and support services on the needs of a smaller residential population on campus, we will be relocating the following residents:</p>
<ul>
<li align="left">Students living in residence halls</li>
<li align="left">Students living at the Camper Park, Village, or University Town Center</li>
<li align="left">Students living in apartments at Cowell College, Redwood Grove, and the Porter Apartment Buildings F and G</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Students will be relocated to College Nine, College Ten, Crown College, or Merrill College. It is our goal to:</p>
<ul>
<li align="left">Reassign apartment residents to the apartments at one of the above communities.</li>
<li align="left">Reassign residence hall residents to the residence hall facilities at one of the above communities. These housing areas are in proximity to one of the two campus dining halls that we currently plan to keep open (College Nine/College Ten Dining Hall and Crown Dining Hall).</li>
<li align="left">Moving assistance will be provided. This will include moving bins, supplies such as cardboard boxes and tape, as well as movers and trucks to transport your belongings to your new housing assignment.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Housing staff are currently working on your new housing assignment. You will soon receive a message with information about your new room assignment and instructions for completing your move. To be clear, this move is mandatory and we appreciate your cooperation. Note: special attention is being placed on students with disability-related needs to ensure the new housing assignment will meet their individual needs.</p>
<p align="left">In order to maximize efficient use of housing space, while also implementing appropriate physical distancing for residents, each room will be assigned as a single. Students will not be negatively financially impacted by this change to single occupancy residency. Instead all residential students will be charged the triple room rate for spring quarter. Additionally, students on the 5-day meal plan for spring quarter will be upgraded, at no additional cost, to the 7-day plan to ensure dining access during the weekends. Students already on the 7-day plan for spring quarter will receive a rate reduction to the cost of the 5-day plan. Apartment residents who wish to obtain the 7-day meal plan at the 5-day plan cost may do so.</p>
<p align="left">You are receiving this letter because you have indicated that you plan to remain in residence this spring. We want you to know the latest information so that you can make an informed decision about your housing situation to the extent that you have choices. If you can make alternate housing arrangements, we strongly urge you to do so. If you do plan to leave campus, please complete the<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://forms.gle/rrUd25b7DVb9oy5P8&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1585945175746000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrzxqg0L5ngKtZSnVd45sWVvlqow" href="https://forms.gle/rrUd25b7DVb9oy5P8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Intent to Vacate form</a><span>&#160;</span>to indicate your intention to move-out of university housing as soon as possible. We will continue to offer a full housing refund for spring quarter to students who give their intent to vacate and complete their move-out by April 19.</p>
<p align="left">Based upon the current public health information available, the following details the conditions we anticipate in our residential buildings during spring quarter. Please keep in mind that this is an evolving situation and circumstances may change further.</p>
<ul>
<li align="left">We are doing all we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, the virus has already become so prevalent that public health authorities believe that if testing were more widely available, it would reveal that many of us, including UCSC students and employees, have already been exposed to this virus.</li>
<li align="left">The primary public health strategy is mitigation: reducing exposure by rigorous compliance with physical distancing recommendations, cessation of group gatherings, regular handwashing and extra care to avoid unnecessary contact with our most vulnerable populations. This is most effective when followed by all of us as individuals. However, we want to prepare you for the reality that some people residing in as well as staff supporting campus housing will inevitably become ill with COVID-19.</li>
<li align="left">It is also inevitable that students who become sick with COVID-19 but are not ill enough to require hospitalization will need to self-isolate in campus residences. Students who are exposed to the virus before they realize it will be living in some proximity to students who are well, increasing the potential for the virus to spread.</li>
<li align="left">We will close several of the residential buildings and relocate any students residing there, as well as adjust our housing and dining operations to improve physical distancing.</li>
<li align="left">Any resident who remains on campus for spring should be prepared to be relocated (possibly more than once) so that we may create spaces for isolation as well as quarantine.</li>
<li align="left">Dining Services will be limited to take-out only meals.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">We appreciate that this information may add to your anxiety during what is an already stressful time. It is our goal to share as much information as we have as quickly as possible so you can make decisions that are right for you.</p>
<p align="left">Since you are planning to remain in residence during spring, please begin to prepare yourself for relocation, and follow instructions that will follow from your Housing/Student Life Office.</p>
