Santa Cruz have received awards from the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center for their outstanding contributions to research in 2019. These awards reflect the groundbreaking research being conducted through the Fisheries Collaborative Program, which brings together UCSC and NOAA scientists to conduct research for the conservation and management of California&#8217;s living marine resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;These awardees are helping to make UCSC a leader in coastal ecology, fisheries management, and conservation,&#8221; said Eric Palkovacs, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and associate director of the Fisheries Collaborative Program.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca Miller</strong></p>
<p>Rebecca Miller, an IMS associate specialist, received the National Marine Fisheries Service Team Member of the Year Award in the Program Management/ Scientific/Technical, GS 1-10 or pay band equivalent category. Miller&#8217;s research focuses on historical fisheries catches and the spatiotemporal abundance patterns of a variety of marine fishes and invertebrates in the California Current.</p>
<p>Miller&#8217;s most recent work evaluated the abundance of <em>Pyrosoma atlanticum</em>, a pelagic tunicate species that forms cylindrical-shaped colonies composed of thousands of tiny individuals. During and after the 2015-16 Large Marine Heatwave, these historically rare pyrosomes were encountered in very high abundance throughout the California Current. Very little is known about pyrosomes, as they are typically found in low densities in the world&#8217;s tropical and subtropical oceans. When environmental conditions are favorable, however, they undergo exponential population growth leading to mass occurrences that are likely to have significant consequences on energy flow and community structure.</p>
<p><strong>Heather Welch</strong></p>
<p>Heather Welch, an IMS associate specialist, received the National Marine Fisheries Service Team Member of the Year Award in the Program Management/ Scientific/Technical, GS 11-15 or pay band equivalent category. Welch was recognized for her exemplary leadership and high productivity in developing and implementing ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) tools in support of NOAA's mission to maintain sustainable fisheries and reduce risk to protected species. She made significant contributions to the development of EcoCast, a near-real-time tool to optimize fisheries potential and reduce bycatch in the California Drift Gillnet Fishery. This was the first dynamic ocean management application to a U.S. fishery on the West Coast.</p>
<p>Welch also led the operationalization of WhaleWatch, which combines blue whale tracking data with satellite observations to produce near-real-time habitat suitability maps and reduce ship-strike risk in southern California waters. In addition to her pioneering efforts in developing EBFM tools, she led several high-profile publications and successful grant proposals.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Kiernan</strong></p>
<p>Joseph Kiernan, a NOAA research ecologist with an IMS researcher affiliation, received the National Marine Fisheries Service Employee of the Year Award in the Program Management/ Scientific/Technical, GS 11-15 or pay band equivalent category. Kiernan has made important contributions to the stewardship and conservation of protected salmon and steelhead in Scott Creek and nearby watersheds, as well as significant improvements to data collection methods and record-keeping practices. He was recognized for his stewardship of coho salmon and steelhead in Scott Creek and nearby watersheds of the Santa Cruz Mountains, leadership and perseverance in the face of ongoing uncertainty about funding for the Scott Creek monitoring effort and coho salmon broodstock program, and major contributions to grant writing, related manuscripts, and development of a Hatchery Genetic Management Plan for Scott Creek&#8217;s Kingfisher Flat Hatchery.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0c19d8b68072701763b3cba6cea12bce"><name>updates-on-community-safety-services</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Updates on community safety services and ongoing engagement</title><summary>I write to announce that effective July 1, the UC Santa Cruz Campus Safety Community Advisory Board will report directly to the chancellor and will operate with a new, more expansive charge.</summary><start-date>1593586800000</start-date><display-name>Updates on community safety services and ongoing engagement</display-name><path>/2020/07/updates-on-community-safety-services</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/07/updates-on-community-safety-services</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1593635887254</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1593635887254</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>Dear Campus Community,</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I write to announce that effective July 1, the UC Santa Cruz Campus Safety Community Advisory Board will report directly to the chancellor and will operate with a new, more expansive charge. In consultation with other campus leaders, the Academic Senate and the board&#8217;s current membership, we also will review and update the board's composition. UC Santa Cruz first established a police advisory board in 2014 which previously reported to Police Chief Nader Oweis.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>My goal for this reconstituted UC Santa Cruz Campus Safety Community Advisory Board is to create the space necessary for ongoing assessment and change. This is also one space in which to imagine new forms of public safety services and new forms of community engagement that are not structured by opposition. The ultimate goal of the board is to model ways that an institution can hold itself accountable, engage in thoughtful dialogue and collective planning, and place itself on a path for healing. Board membership will be representative of the campus and membership terms will be one or two years and staggered to ensure continuity.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As white supremacist structures and the mechanisms for enacting anti-Black violence are exposed across the country, our campus must meet this moment by examining our structures and working toward meaningful change. While there are many areas for improvement and arenas for this work on campus, the difficulties of this year and the concerns of our community make a renewed advisory board an important first step.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I do believe that change is possible. </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r_XycLrGwnLRqdE01spflU7w8tGldkL1/view?usp%3Dsharing&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1593721303948000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFgUPk9eEwj54PfSexCH7HEs7EZEA" href="ucsc-pd-community-policing-actions-summary-2020.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Already our police department has been working to align</span></a><span> itself with President Obama&#8217;s </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/taskforce/taskforce_finalreport.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1593721303948000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHWHpDgQWRH8agppYOfJVH-IZyPaA" href="https://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/taskforce/taskforce_finalreport.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>21st Century Policing model</span></a><span>, which calls on us to recognize &#8220;past and present injustice and discrimination and how it is a hurdle to the promotion of community trust.&#8221; But we must do more.&#160;</span></p>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span><strong>Conduct an annual assessment that tracks how the department is performing across the six pillars of the report.</strong> </span><span>The first assessment will be due in March 2021 and will be published online. The Campus Safety Community Advisory Board will review the annual assessment and provide feedback to me.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>We will conduct a survey of students, faculty and staff in October through the UC Berkeley School of Public Policy to get feedback on individual interactions with and perceptions of campus police.&#160;</strong></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Our police department will pursue full accreditation by the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators.</strong><span> This will expand accountability and competency across all aspects of our campus police department as we set the highest expectations in serving our campus.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I am appointing a work group to make recommendations on furthering the strong foundation of diversity in hiring and recruitment within our police department.</strong><span> Already, the hiring process includes a robust diversity recruitment effort and has actively recruited UC graduates who understand the campus environment.

</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>We will host multiple procedural justice training sessions over the course of the year for members of our campus community and of our police department to train together. </strong><span>All members of the Campus Safety Community Advisory Board will go through this training, including CP/EVC Kletzer and myself.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The police department will partner with UCSC Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) and others to develop a Crisis Intervention Team model for responding to mental health calls.</strong><span> This work will be framed by the National Alliance on Mental Illness model.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This work is in addition to continuing training by our campus police in cultural awareness, procedural justice, implicit bias, cultural diversity, hate crimes, trauma-informed interviewing, intimate partner violence, criminal law, constitutional law, and civil rights, as well as managing stressful situations.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The past year has been a difficult one in many ways. Only by embracing challenges and addressing barriers through transformative and collaborative work can we achieve real and sustainable change.</span></p>

Marm Kilpatrick this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kilpatrick, UC Santa Cruz professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, delivered that hard-hitting message at the tail end of his online Kraw Lecture, part of a popular series of science and technology talks made possible by&#160; a gift from UC Santa Cruz alumnus George Kraw (Cowell &#8216;71, history and Russian literature).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a Zoom talk that drew 1,300 people, Kilpatrick laid out the life-or-death stakes of human behavior in the face of this epidemic. &#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can stop the pandemic by making small changes in our behavior,&#8217;&#8217; he said.&#160; &#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have to actively choose to do so and do it together.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though governments can help immensely, it is the vigilance of the people, not our leaders, who will determine the final outcome, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kilpatrick also urged &#8220;no close sustained unmasked indoor contact between households.&#8221; He warned that transmission within households is very difficult to prevent, so &#8220;we need to stop the virus from spreading between households." He called for people to increase the space between them when they socialized outdoors -- &#8220;more is better&#8221;-- while wearing masks, even if they feel fine, to protect those around them.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kilpatrick spoke those cautionary words at a time when health officials have been pleading with the U.S. population to celebrate July 4th at home, with eight states reporting single-day highs in cases, and when Santa Cruz&#8217;s mayor, Justin Cummings, has</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">asked residents to consider staying home and steering clear of beaches during the holiday weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Governor Gavin Newsom reported a 45 percent increase in cases and a 43 percent increase in hospitalizations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> According to a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">database, more than 2,653,200 people in the United States have been infected with the coronavirus and at least 127,400 have died.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If people have been socially distancing, but succumb to the temptation to meet up with friends at bars and restaurants from households that haven&#8217;t taken the same precautions, &#8220;we will get more transmission,&#8217;&#8217; Kilpatrick said. &#8220;Some people wonder, &#8216;if the bar is open, why can&#8217;t I get a drink in a bar with a friend from another household that I haven&#8217;t seen in three months?' If you want to get together safely, do this outdoors, from a distance, and wear masks.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his online dialogue with UC Santa Cruz assistant professor of microbiology Jacqueline Kimmey, Kilpatrick also addressed a frequently asked and fatalistic question about COVID: &#8220;why delay the inevitable? We will all get infected anyway.&#8221; Kilpatrick addressed the fallacy that lies at the heart of the loaded question. Infection, he said, is far from inevitable.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most California communities, including Santa Cruz County, less than five percent of the population has been infected. But letting the virus spread now, unimpeded, would lead to 30 to 70 percent of the population becoming infected, causing 20 to 50 times more hospitalizations and deaths, he said. And each month we delay infection, we discover new treatments and make progress on vaccines. He mentioned the three vaccines that are now in clinical trials. There are more than 140 vaccines in development.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every month of renewed vigilance is crucial, he said. He mentioned new treatments, including Dexamethasone, which has reduced mortality for between 20 to 33 percent for a subset of patients, and others that reduce hospital stay, including Remdesivir. &#8220;Limiting transmissions for a few more months could make a huge difference in illnesses and deaths,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kilpatrick also dismantled the idea that communities with a relatively small rate of COVID-19 infection should let down their guard and follow the philosophy that there&#8217;s no need to take action &#8216;when things seem OK. Things can get bad very quickly.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the face of such a daunting disease, what can people do to stop the spread? Kilpatrick emphasized the three-step approach of &#8220;test, trace, and isolate.&#8221; To stop transmission via contact tracing, people need to get tested at the very first sign of mild symptoms, he said. Testing must be incentivized by making it free, and easy as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Safe isolation space must be provided for cases and contacts. He also doubled down on the importance of masks to protect communities. When worn properly, they can reduce expelled droplets and microbes by 80 percent, while offering some protection to the wearer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He saw no clear, simple and easy path forward for school reopenings. &#8220;Everyone working on COVID-19 says reopening schools should be a high priority.&#8217;&#8217; But daunting challenges remain. One way to keep schools open is to insist upon &#8220;very high frequency testing. A recent paper says you can reduce infection if you test daily.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it would be difficult to have sufficient testing capacity, and the cost of such an undertaking could be prohibitive, even if the costs per test were greatly reduced, Kilpatrick said.&#160; The bottom line is that reopening schools and universities safely, cheaply and easily is a challenging proposition, he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kilpatrick also addressed the phenomenon of &#8220;super-spreading events.&#8217;&#8217; He mentioned a truism for all infectious diseases including COVID-19: a few cases lead to the most infections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Communication is the number-one priority,&#8217;&#8217; Kilpatrick said. &#8220;We need to make sure everyone understands that the main way the virus spreads is with close sustained unmasked indoor contact. We need to make it clear that we all need to do our part to reduce those kinds of contacts in our lives.&#8220;</span></p>

<p>Approximately 90 percent of all stars end their lives as white dwarfs, very dense stellar remnants that gradually cool and dim over billions of years. With their final few breaths before they collapse, however, these stars leave an important legacy, spreading their ashes into the surrounding space through stellar winds enriched with chemical elements, including carbon, newly synthesized in the star&#8217;s deep interior during the last stages before its death.</p>
<p>Every carbon atom in the universe was created by stars, through the fusion of three helium nuclei. But astrophysicists still debate which types of stars are the primary source of the carbon in our own galaxy, the Milky Way. Some studies favor low-mass stars that blew off their envelopes in stellar winds and became white dwarfs, while others favor massive stars that eventually exploded as supernovae.</p>
<p>In the new study, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1132-1">published July 6 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em></a>, an international team of astronomers discovered and analyzed white dwarfs in open star clusters in the Milky Way, and their findings help shed light on the origin of the carbon in our galaxy. Open star clusters are groups of up to a few thousand stars, formed from the same giant molecular cloud and roughly the same age, and held together by mutual gravitational attraction. The study was based on astronomical observations conducted in 2018 at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii and led by coauthor Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the analysis of the observed Keck spectra, it was possible to measure the masses of the white dwarfs. Using the theory of stellar evolution, we were able to trace back to the progenitor stars and derive their masses at birth,&#8221; explained Ramirez-Ruiz, who also holds a Niels Bohr Professorship at the University of Copenhagen.</p>
<p>The relationship between the initial masses of stars and their final masses as white dwarfs is known as the initial-final mass relation, a fundamental diagnostic in astrophysics that integrates information from the entire life cycles of stars, linking birth to death. In general, the more massive the star at birth, the more massive the white dwarf left at its death, and this trend has been supported on both observational and theoretical grounds.</p>
<p>But analysis of the newly discovered white dwarfs in old open clusters gave a surprising result: the masses of these white dwarfs were notably larger than expected, putting a &#8220;kink&#8221; in the initial-final mass relation for stars with initial masses in a certain range.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our study interprets this kink in the initial-final mass relationship as the signature of the synthesis of carbon made by low-mass stars in the Milky Way,&#8221; said lead author Paola Marigo at the University of Padua in Italy.</p>
<p>In the last phases of their lives, stars twice as massive as our Sun produced new carbon atoms in their hot interiors, transported them to the surface, and finally spread them into the interstellar medium through gentle stellar winds. The team&#8217;s detailed stellar models indicate that the stripping of the carbon-rich outer mantle occurred slowly enough to allow the central cores of these stars, the future white dwarfs, to grow appreciably in mass.</p>
<p>Analyzing the initial-final mass relation around the kink, the researchers concluded that stars bigger than 2 solar masses also contributed to the galactic enrichment of carbon, while stars of less than 1.5 solar masses did not. In other words, 1.5 solar masses represents the minimum mass for a star to spread carbon-enriched ashes upon its death.</p>
<p>These findings place stringent constraints on how and when carbon, the element essential to life on Earth, was produced by the stars of our galaxy, eventually ending up trapped in the raw material from which the Sun and its planetary system were formed 4.6 billion years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we know that the carbon came from stars with a birth mass of not less than roughly 1.5 solar masses,&#8221; said Marigo.</p>
<p>Coauthor Pier-Emmanuel Tremblay at University of Warwick said, &#8220;One of most exciting aspects of this research is that it impacts the age of known white dwarfs, which are essential cosmic probes to understand the formation history of the Milky Way. The initial-to-final mass relation is also what sets the lower mass limit for supernovae, the gigantic explosions seen at large distances and that are really important to understand the nature of the universe.&#8221;</p>
<p>By combining the theories of cosmology and stellar evolution, the researchers concluded that bright carbon-rich stars close to their death, quite similar to the progenitors of the white dwarfs analyzed in this study, are presently contributing to a vast amount of the light emitted by very distant galaxies. This light, carrying the signature of newly produced carbon, is routinely collected by large telescopes to probe the evolution of cosmic structures. A reliable interpretation of this light depends on understanding the synthesis of carbon in stars.</p>
<p>In addition to Marigo, Tremblay, and Ramirez-Ruiz, the coauthors of the paper include scientists at Johns Hopkins University, American Museum of Natural History in New York, Columbia University, Space Telescope Science Institute, University of Warwick, University of Montreal, University of Uppsala, International School for Advanced Studies in Trieste, Italian National Institute for Astrophysics, and the University of Geneva. This research was supported by the European Union through an ERC Consolidator Grant and the DNRF through a Niels Bohr Professorship.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="20d70ff58072701763b3cba6d8496415"><name>covarrubias-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Connecting on campus</title><summary>Social psychologist Rebecca Covarrubias documents the experiences of students who are the first in their family to attend college.</summary><start-date>1594018800000</start-date><display-name>Connecting on campus</display-name><path>/2020/07/covarrubias-profile</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/07/covarrubias-profile</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1593983832027</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594668081229</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Faculty Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Ashleigh F.

<p>An associate professor of psychology at UC Santa Cruz, Covarrubias is a prominent figure in research about students who are the first in their family to attend college and about the built-in obstacles they must overcome to graduate.</p>
<p>"Universities developed a predominantly white, American, and middle-to-upper middle class culture," says Megan Robbins, an associate professor of psychology at UC Riverside who is a friend and former colleague. "Covarrubias is doing groundbreaking work, demonstrating with scientific evidence that this imposed culture doesn't fit for everyone."</p>
<p>Family achievement guilt is the emotion that arises from gaining access to more resources than family members or causing familial sacrifice to support higher education. The difficulties of navigating a university system built for one type of student can challenge first-generation students as they strive to achieve their academic potential. Getting the vibe that they're not welcome or their culture isn't valued can stunt their ability to learn.</p>
<p>"It's the implicit things, the things that make you feel funny in a classroom but you don't know why," Covarrubias says.</p>
<p>A social psychologist, Covarrubias leads several research projects to foster more equitable educational opportunities for first-generation, low-income, and students of color. Her team is creating a more precise dictionary for describing students' emotional experiences and working with faculty members to alleviate students&#8217; guilt and inequities. The goal is to address the spoken and unspoken elements in a classroom that can deter underrepresented students from graduating.</p>
<p>For example, using community-oriented phrasing (&#8220;we&#8221;) instead of individualistic words (&#8220;you&#8221;) in campus communications can make a difference, she says. Her research has shown that revising campus messaging to include "we" language can help first-generation students of color feel less guilt for leaving their families behind.</p>
<p>Covarrubias also stresses the importance of recognizing that some students are unfamiliar with campus resources that others take for granted. Not explaining how office hours work or that they're available to all students presupposes that everyone knows how to take advantage of this assistance. "Naming these things is work towards equity," she says.</p>
<h2>Growing Up</h2>
<p>Covarrubias was raised with a steadfast respect for rules and loved being a good student. She grew up in a low income area near downtown Phoenix, Arizona, but it had everything she needed and more. Her neighborhood was filled with a strong sense of community, parks safe for all ages, and a library two blocks away from her house.</p>
<p>"It was an under-resourced neighborhood when I was growing up, but it had so many strengths as a community,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It wasn't until years later that I fully appreciated all of its riches."</p>
<p>The library in particular became a special place. Reading programs, with trinkets for prizes, piqued her interest and turned Covarrubias into a regular.</p>
<p>Covarrubias&#8217; mother raised four kids in a two-bedroom home and took care of everything around the house. Her father, a school bus driver and landscaper, was the spark who kept everyone entertained and laughing. He was also known as a legendary storyteller, instilling in Covarrubias the importance of an engaging narrative. Later in life, when the fear of presenting her work to large groups challenged her reserved nature, she remembered her father&#8217;s tales and discovered her ability to tell a compelling story.</p>
<p>The overflowing familial and community support during Covarrubias&#8217; early years gave her the confidence to excel in class. "She was bright and challenged each of her classmates to do better," recalls her middle school math teacher, Lily Wong. "She was one of those students that, as a teacher, you wish you had a whole classroom of them."</p>
<p>Near the end of middle school, teachers encouraged Covarrubias to take an assessment exam for a high school that offered a rigorous International Baccalaureate program. She was selected and excelled in the coursework, but for the first time, she realized that not all of her peers grew up in a neighborhood like hers, with bilingual parents who had to work hard to put food on the table.</p>
<p>"There were a lot of wealthy, white students,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I remember thinking for the first time, 'Am I smart enough?'"</p>
<h2>Away from home</h2>
<p>This newfound hyperawareness of inequity followed Covarrubias to college at the University of Arizona in Tucson. On its desert oasis-like campus with swaying palm trees and wealth splashed around, Covarrubias felt out of place. "No one came up to me and said I didn't belong there," she says, but she didn't see anyone who looked like her or seemed to come from a low-income background.</p>
<p>It was also her first time away from home. No one in her family had ever moved away for college, and she felt guilty about leaving everyone behind while she got to experience the nearly endless opportunities on campus.</p>
<p>Like most incoming freshmen, Covarrubias decided to live on-campus her first year. But getting used to having a large room shared with only one other student took some time. "I grew up with a big family, so I got used to sharing space with a lot of people," she says. Slowly, Covarrubias adjusted and found ways to make the room feel like her own with a childhood diary and family photos.</p>
<p>One thing that remained missing&#8212;an item found in nearly every other student's room&#8212;was a computer. Covarrubias didn&#8217;t want to ask her family to buy her new, crisp sheets for her extra-long college dorm room bed, let alone expensive electronics. Instead, she typed homework assignments at the campus computer lab or borrowed her roommate's laptop when it wasn't being used. This sometimes meant her school work had to wait until the middle of the night while her roommate slept.</p>
<p>Months into her first year, Covarrubias received a call from Mrs. Wong. An extra computer, still in perfect working order, sat unused in her middle school classroom. Later that week, Mrs. Wong drove nearly two hours to Tucson to deliver the computer to her dorm room.</p>
<p>As part of her family studies major, Covarrubias took an introductory psychology course that revealed a way for her to describe the emotions she had been experiencing since high school.</p>
<p>"I learned that research allows us to understand a framework and use tools to name it, study it, and do something about it," she says.</p>
<p>In her third year at University of Arizona, Covarrubias entered the federally-funded Ronald E. McNair Achievement Program, which is designed to accelerate the path of first-generation and low income students towards doctoral work. For the first time, Covarrubias met other college students with similar backgrounds and interests, and she got involved in research that felt powerfully rewarding.</p>
<p>Her team investigated stereotyping of Indigenous children in elementary and middle schools. This work exposed Covarrubias to the idea that a teacher or educational setting could influence a student's ability and motivation.</p>
<p>"That's what felt most eye opening,&#8221; she says. &#8220;These social and cultural cues tell you very strongly whether you'll do well or you belong in a particular place.&#8221;</p>
<p>These personal realizations led Covarrubias to pursue a Ph.D. at the University of Arizona in social and cultural psychology. The guilt that she had experienced as an undergraduate, which only intensified with her decision to enter a graduate program, became a focus of her research. She and her advisor, Stephanie Fryberg, surveyed 300 college students about their emotions related to college achievement and their families' lack of opportunities. The researchers found that first-generation students reported feeling more guilt than students whose parents had attended college did; Latino students were particularly affected. The results led Covarrubias and Fryberg to coin the term 'family achievement guilt' to explain the students&#8217; emotional strife.</p>
<p>A second study identified ways to alleviate that guilt. When participants were asked to reflect on a time when they helped a family member with a problem, then answered the same questions about their emotions surrounding college, they tended to report less intense family achievement guilt. By encouraging first-generation students to share family stories, faculty members could ease the students&#8217; burden and affirm their place in the academic system, Covarrubias says.</p>
<h2>The Next Generation</h2>
<p>Despite earning a Ph.D., Covarrubias struggled to see herself in academia. She didn't have many role models in faculty positions and was put off by the "publish or perish" culture. But when UC Santa Cruz offered Covarrubias the opportunity to translate her research into practice, she took a calculated leap of faith.</p>
<p>"They said, 'Come as you are,'&#8221; she says. &#8220;I didn't have to prioritize certain pieces. All of me and my work was valued.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ibette Valle says when she first read Covarrubias&#8217; 2015 study on family achievement guilt as an undergraduate, she felt "fiery" inside. Also a low-income first-generation student and McNair scholar, Valle immediately connected with the theories and newly-defined terms in the paper.</p>
<p>"She was doing research on something I had experienced but could never name," Valle says. This spark inspired her to apply for a position in Covarrubias' lab.</p>
<p>Now a graduate student working with Covarrubias, Valle is helping a local high school prepare first-generation and low-income students for college culture. Other students under Covarrubias' guidance are testing a new way to communicate with students who are on academic probation. To replace the cold-sounding email that's used today, the researchers are experimenting with a warmer tone that implies a sense of understanding and sensitivity towards adversity.</p>
<p>Covarrubias recounts a time shortly after she began teaching at UCSC that captured the essence of her work. Her team held a workshop for first-year, first-generation students of color to discuss their transition to college and solicit feedback for staff and faculty. One student wrote, "We just want you to have more compassion, we want you to know who we are, we want you to care about us." The advice resonated so much with Covarrubias&#8217; own experiences that she memorized it. Those words, she feels, convey the most critical way educators can help students succeed.</p>
<p>"It's simple,&#8221; she says. &#8220;They're asking for connection."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

Santa Cruz emerita professor of literature Karen Tei Yamashita is a dazzling collection of short stories a</span><span>bout growing up and living in Japanese America.</span></p>
<p><span>Blending fiction and history, Jane Austen and the Japanese immigrant experience, American pop culture and Japanese traditions, these inventive, witty, often surreal, and sometimes poignant stories explore the pain and strength of the Japanese American experience.</span></p>
<p><span><i>Sansei and Sensibility</i> is a retrospective of Yamashita&#8217;s short pieces, including her very </span><span>first short story, <i>The Bath</i>, which was originally published in 1975 in <i>Amerasia Journal</i>.</span></p>
<p><span>Featuring an intergenerational cast of Japanese-American characters, the book offers the perspective of what it&#8217;s like to be a &#8220;sansei&#8221;&#8212;the grandchild of Asian immigrants&#8212;contemplating what to pass on to the next generation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The first half of the book are stories previously published but also dipping into our sansei world over the years,&#8221; said Yamashita. &#8220;I included a timeline to show comparatively the Japanese American generations (issei, nisei, sansei) along with significant historical events, particularly pertaining to Los Angeles and Southern California, where I was raised.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;When my mother died at age 99 in 2015, I finally figured out that we sanseis were no longer the juveniles of the sixties, the rabble rousers who forced the hand of the Japanese American redress movement and Asian American studies; we were the has-been,&#8221; she added.&#160;&#8220;It seemed to me that some record of what we've been and done might be of interest, if to no one but our memorial selves&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Yamashita described how the book came about.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The inspiration for this collection is my sister Jane Tomi.&#160;She has been a longtime reader of Jane Austen and a Janeite, a very conscientious and active member of the Jane Austen Society.&#160;Truth is, I hadn't really read Jane Austen, so I finally did, all of the novels, and wondered why my sister, a Japanese American sansei, would become a fan of this literature.&#160;I still don't really know why she's a fan, but as I read Austen, I began to think about my sister and me, growing up as we did in a tightly knit provincial Japanese American community in Los Angeles.&#160;And I transferred our&#160;experiences into that world.&#8221; &#160;</span></p>
<p><span>In writing the new collection, as well as her previous book, <i>Letters to Memory</i>, Yamashita had to revisit the history of the Japanese American internment through the eyes of her parents and their generation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;My sister and I were born after the war, and we did not learn of the imprisonment of our parents and their families until we were older, say in junior high school,&#8221; said Yamashita.&#160;&#8220;Even then, the consequences of that history were not clear to us.&#160;As I reflected on our childhood in that community and wrote these stories, I began to understand that what had been hidden in memory and shame had always been there percolating, that it was the backdrop that formed our social relationships, the quiet antagonisms, and the hurt that festered in our proposed future.&#160;For Japanese Americans, the postwar has meant something particular; perhaps that is what these stories try to feel for.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>The author of eight books, Yamashita received a 2011 California Book Award in the Fiction category for her novel&#160;<i>I Hotel</i>, and was&#160;a finalist for the National Book Award.&#160;<i>I Hotel</i>&#160;also won the American Book Award, the Asian/Pacific American Librarians Association Award, and the Association for Asian American Studies Book Award.</span></p>
<p><span>Known for her intensely researched works that reflect her interest in communities whose stories often go untold, Yamashita received the&#160;Chancellor&#8217;s Award for Diversity&#160;in 2009 and was co-holder with feminist studies professor Bettina Aptheker of the UC Presidential Chair for Feminist Critical Race and Ethnic Studies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;During my 20 years at UCSC, teaching and working with students, I worked with faculty in hopes of creating an Asian American studies program,&#8221; said Yamashita.&#160; &#8220;We came away with Critical Race and Ethnic Studies, and I worked with Bettina Aptheker in Feminist Studies to support the programming in these fields of study.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>"Over time, in my literature lecture courses, I'd see more Asian American students, who were not in the humanities but in the sciences, business, computer science; they'd balk at the reading in the syllabus, but I'd say, please stay, take it pass/no pass, but stay; this is important; it's about race and immigration, and you need to know this to understand the world out there whatever work you choose to do.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Now I think about our teachers in ethnic studies, American history, critical race and gender studies, all across the nation, how what they've had to say in their classes has been so necessary and essential to American education,&#8221; she added. &#8220;They too are essential workers.&#160; We need to support and to give them space.&#8221;</span></p>

We affirm that the diversity of community is our strength and refuse to succumb to actions or statements that seek to invalidate some members of our community.<br/><br/>America&#8217;s history of lynching of Black people is a national shame. Lynching was a horrific public spectacle designed to silence, traumatize, and disempower individuals and entire communities. Campus police are investigating an incident that involved four people hanging a looped rope on one of our street signs at the base of campus. Regardless of what may have been intended, these actions recall some of the ugliest legacies of white supremacy and remind us all of the daily threat of violence faced by ABC-identified students, staff, faculty, and community members. Anti-Blackness cannot stand.<br/><br/>In Santa Cruz, the director of the Hillel Center shared information that the center was recently vandalized by someone who appeared to be having mental health challenges and did not seem motivated by hate. The director noted that the event occurred during a time when anti-Semitic and hate-driven incidents are on the rise. We want to acknowledge the impact this incident has on our Jewish community members, who may feel unsafe and vulnerable.<br/><br/>Every day we must all work toward a more just and equitable country, one that acknowledges its failings and strives for equality and justice. We will not succumb to divisiveness. We will continue to support each other and strive to create a healthy and more affirming climate.<br/><br/>We encourage our community to reach out for support.

<p dir="ltr"><span>The breadth and scope of Dr. Drake&#8217;s experience as a university leader, his deep familiarity of the University of California, and his training as a physician will greatly benefit our system. His expertise will be key as we collectively navigate a return to our core missions of education, research and public service in a world that has been greatly changed by COVD-19.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Dr. Drake served as UC Irvine chancellor, as Vice President for Health Affairs for the UC system, and was on the faculty of UC San Francisco for more than two decades. He grew up in Sacramento. He knows California well, and is a passionate advocate for the Golden State and its residents. Importantly, he also knows our challenges. I am excited for the opportunity to work with him as we build on the upward trajectory of our Santa Cruz campus.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I also want to take a moment to thank retiring UC President Janet Napolitano for her strong leadership over the past seven years. She has been a steadfast advocate for California students, helping to stabilize tuition while also expanding access to higher education to thousands of young people, many from traditionally underserved communities. We are a stronger system because of her leadership.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2f850d2c8072701763b3cba6bcec4e29"><name>uc-welcomes-our-next-president</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC welcomes our next president: Michael V.

Drake, M.D., as the 21st president of UC&#8217;s world-renowned system of 10 campuses, five medical centers, three nationally affiliated labs, more than 280,000 students and 230,000 faculty and staff.</strong></p>
<p>Drake has a long and distinguished career in higher education, most recently as president of The Ohio State University (OSU) from 2014 until this past week. Prior to his six years at OSU, his entire academic career has been at UC, including as chancellor of UC Irvine for nine years from 2005 to 2014 and as the systemwide vice president for health affairs from 2000 to 2005.</p>
<p>Drake received his A.B. from Stanford University and his residency, M.D., and fellowship in ophthalmology from UCSF. He subsequently spent more than two decades on the faculty of the UCSF School of Medicine, including as the Steven P. Shearing Professor of Ophthalmology.</p>
<p>Under his leadership, Drake greatly enhanced UC Irvine&#8217;s reputation as a premier university. UC Irvine rose to join the top 10 public universities in U.S. News &amp; World Report&#8217;s annual list and was ranked by Times Higher Education as the No. 1 university in the U.S. under 50 years old. During his tenure at the campus, the four-year graduation rate increased by more than 18 percent, while undergraduate enrollment and diversity significantly increased. In addition, Drake oversaw the establishment of new schools of law and education as well as programs in public health, nursing and pharmacy.</p>
<p>Drake&#8217;s tenure at OSU was marked by record-high applications and graduation rates, groundbreaking research and strong donor support. He established several successful programs to increase student access and affordability, including a tuition guarantee program; enhanced scholarships covering the cost of attendance; and increased grants to support middle- and lower-income students. In fact, OSU&#8217;s need-based financial aid increased by more than $200 million between 2015 and 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much has changed in the 15 years since I was given the privilege of becoming chancellor at UC Irvine, but not my absolute belief in this great University and its time-honored mission,&#8221; Drake said. &#8220;I look forward to working with the regents, chancellors, students, faculty, staff, alumni, and our broader community as we, together, guide the University through the challenging times ahead. Brenda and I are thrilled to be back. Fiat Lux!&#8221;</p>
<h3>&#8216;Personifies the qualities we looked for in selecting a new president&#8217;</h3>
<p>Drake has published numerous articles and co-authored six books. He served as a reviewer for several medical journals, including the Journal of the American Medical Association, Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science and the American Journal of Ophthalmology. Drake is a member of several national scientific and scholarly societies, and has received various awards for teaching, public service, mentoring and research. He is a member of the National Academy of Medicine and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He received the UCSF School of Medicine&#8217;s Clinical Teaching Award, the Hogan Award for Laboratory Research, the Chancellor&#8217;s Award for Public Service, the Martin Luther King Jr. Award for University Service, the UC Irvine Medal, and the University of California Presidential Medal in recognition of his exemplary service to the University.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Drake personifies the qualities we looked for in selecting a new president: He is committed to seeing the whole student and to supporting all our students. He recognizes the incalculable value of faculty and staff to the University&#8217;s mission, and he understands the importance of the public and private partnerships that help us achieve that mission,&#8221; said John A. P&#233;rez, chair of the UC Board of Regents. &#8220;As the first person of color to serve as UC president, Dr. Drake returns to UC at an important point in the University&#8217;s journey. This is a homecoming the University of California is very excited to be celebrating early.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;Much has changed in the 15 years since I was given the privilege of becoming chancellor at UC Irvine, but not my absolute belief in this great University and its time-honored mission. Fiat Lux!&#8220;</em></strong><br/><strong>&#8211;Dr. Michael V. Drake</strong></p>
<p>Drake&#8217;s extensive public service experience includes various roles for the American Medical Association, the National Eye Institute, the Association of American Medical Colleges, and multiple commissions on health in the state of California. He is a former chair of the board of directors of the Association of American Universities and currently serves as a member of the board of directors for the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities. He is also the chair of the board of governors of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, a member of the American Talent Initiative Steering Committee, and a member of the board of directors of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stepping down as president of the University of California is bittersweet, especially after seven wonderful, dynamic years, but I depart knowing Dr. Michael Drake will lead with experience and integrity, with the critical support and guidance of the UC Board of Regents,&#8221; said current UC President Janet Napolitano. &#8220;Michael has my full confidence, and I am excited to see how his fresh infusion of ideas and new perspectives will shape the University in the months and years ahead.&#8221;</p>
<h3>A rigorous&#160;search</h3>
<p>The 10-month long search for the University&#8217;s next systemwide leader began in September after&#160;Napolitano announced&#160;she would leave UC in August 2020. The regents&#160;approved rigorous criteria&#160;to guide their search.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC faculty, staff and students repeatedly told us they want a president who will prioritize issues of equity and fairness and be a powerful advocate at the state and national level,&#8221; said Regent Gareth Elliott, chair of the Special Committee in charge of the presidential search. &#8220;When we needed the right person to steward UC&#8217;s global reputation, it turns out we didn't have to look too far from home. I am very proud of this thorough and inclusive search, and I&#8217;m delighted it resulted in such a great match with Dr. Drake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are thrilled that Dr. Drake has chosen to return to UC at this pivotal moment in the midst of profound global and national change,&#8221; said professor Kum-Kum Bhavnani, chair of UC&#8217;s Faculty Academic Senate and the Academic Advisory Committee. &#8220;President-designate Drake&#8217;s demonstrated commitment to undergraduate and graduate students and the work of faculty, understanding of the needs of UC employees, his commitment to social mobility, and his intimate insights into diversity, policing and inclusion ensure UC will continue to be a leader in higher education nationally and internationally as the world enters a bold new era.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Participating in the search for the next UC president was a privilege that I did not take lightly,&#8221; said Student Regent Hayley Weddle, who also served on the Special Committee. &#8220;The top three qualities I was looking for in a new president were a proven record of success in promoting equity and access in higher education, a commitment to working closely with students as partners to address pressing issues such as basic needs and sexual harassment, and a clear vision to advance UC&#8217;s public service mission. President-designate Drake has all of these qualities and more, and I am excited to welcome him back to the University of California.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Board approved Drake&#8217;s salary at $890,000. Pending an academic personnel review, Drake will be appointed as a tenured professor at UCSF.</p>
<p>Drake, 69, and his wife, Brenda, have two grown sons and four grandchildren.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2fbfc4b48072701763b3cba60f9e962c"><name>botanical-supplements</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz leads research center on botanical dietary supplements</title><summary>A new $5 million NIH grant supports a collaborative research program to understand the cellular mechanisms by which botanical natural products may affect human health.</summary><keywords>John MacMillan</keywords><start-date>1594191600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz leads research center on botanical dietary supplements</display-name><path>/2020/07/botanical-supplements</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/07/botanical-supplements</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1594233963674</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594234298147</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/07/images/john-macmiillan-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/07/images/john-macmiillan-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>john-macmiillan-350.jpg</name><display-name>john-macmiillan-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>102249</file-size><width>350</width><height>377</height></image><image-alt>John MacMillan</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/07/images/john-macmiillan-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/07/images/john-macmiillan-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>john-macmiillan-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>john-macmiillan-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25640</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>John MacMillan</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>John MacMillan (photo by C.

Clinical trials like those used to evaluate drugs have largely failed to show efficacy for botanical natural products.</p>
<p>A new research center led by UC Santa Cruz and funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will focus on understanding how botanicals work on the molecular and cellular levels to provide a better foundation for clinical trials of these complex natural products.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to put a scientific foundation behind the use of botanical natural products, so that people can make informed decisions about what botanicals might be helpful to an individual,&#8221; said principal investigator John MacMillan, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In addition to MacMillan&#8217;s lab at UCSC, the center includes research groups led by principal investigator Roger Linington at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, and Nadja Cech at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro. With a grant of $5 million over five years, it is one of five research centers to receive joint funding from the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements, National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), and National Institute on Aging (NIA) to support clinical trials of complex natural products.</p>
<p>&#8220;These research centers demonstrate NIH&#8217;s firm commitment to rigorous investigation of natural products as they pertain to complementary and integrative health approaches,&#8221; said Helene Langevin, M.D., director of NCCIH. &#8220;Exploring basic biological mechanisms of natural products is a strategic priority for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UCSC-led center will address two major challenges in studying botanicals. One is the variability of botanical materials and the difficulty of determining what their active components are. The other issue relates to how clinical trials are designed.</p>
<p>&#8220;In drug trials, we usually have a clear end point&#8212;we want to know if it reduces a particular lipid level or shrinks a tumor. But many people take botanicals for overall health benefits or to enhance their immune system, so how do you measure that? If we have a mechanistic understanding of how they work, then maybe we can design a clinical trial with a more definitive and measurable end point,&#8221; MacMillan said.</p>
<p>The center will use two innovative screening platforms the researchers have developed to measure the effects on cells of complex botanical natural products&#8212;FUSION, developed by MacMillan&#8217;s lab, and Cytological Profiling, developed by Scott Lokey, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC. These high-throughput, information-rich screening platforms, combined with a bioinformatic pipeline for data analysis, will yield insights into the basic mechanisms underlying the activity of the botanical products.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both approaches take advantage of fairly simple cell systems to provide a lot of detailed information,&#8221; MacMillan said. &#8220;We can look at hundreds of features within the cells, from the dynamics of specific proteins to the expression of specific genes, to see what these botanicals might be doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The center&#8217;s approach will also enable the researchers to address the question of whether multiple compounds in complex botanical products interact synergistically to have an effect. &#8220;With our tools, we think we can start to understand synergy in complex mixtures,&#8221; MacMillan said.</p>
<p>The team has selected a list of priority botanicals for deep analysis, focusing on several well-known natural products that have been used for anti-inflammatory effects or for enhancing the immune system. The list includes sweet Annie <em>(Artemisia annua,</em> also called sweet wormwood), goldenseal <em>(Hydrastis canadensis)</em>, feverfew <em>(Tanacetum parthenium)</em>, and ashwagandha <em>(Withania somnifera)</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether these natural products have the benefits for which people take them is still an open question,&#8221; MacMillan said. &#8220;We want to know what molecules are present in these botanicals, is there a robust biological effect on immune cells, and if so, what chemicals are responsible for driving that response?&#8221;</p>
<p>The results of the center&#8217;s analyses will be made broadly available to the natural products research community through open-access algorithms and web-based search tools.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3432ee0c8072701763b3cba6abc5f4cc"><name>campus-union-reach-agreement-ta-wildcat-strike-actions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus, union reach agreement for majority of TA wildcat strike actions</title><summary>Following several months of discussions, UC Santa Cruz and the union that represents teaching assistants and other academic student employees (United Auto Workers 2865) have reached an agreement related to one of the charges filed by UAW 2865 and to other elements of the wildcat strike of this past year. </summary><start-date>1594278000000</start-date><display-name>Campus, union reach agreement for majority of TA wildcat strike actions</display-name><path>/2020/07/campus-union-reach-agreement-ta-wildcat-strike-actions</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/07/campus-union-reach-agreement-ta-wildcat-strike-actions</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1594308619761</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594308619761</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span>As the campus continues to prepare for fall quarter, we can close some of the chapters of a turbulent past academic year. Following several months of discussions, UC Santa Cruz and the union that represents teaching assistants and other academic student employees (United Auto Workers 2865) have reached an agreement related to one of the charges filed by UAW 2865 and to other elements of the wildcat strike of this past year. This settlement does not resolve all claims between the campus and the academic student-employee union concerning the wildcat strike, but it does address a number of employment discipline and student-conduct matters.</span><br/><br/><span>Our agreement:</span><br/>
<ul>
<li>sets a clear, expedited course toward potential employment eligibility in fall quarter for academic student employees who were dismissed from their jobs;</li>
<li>removes grade-deletion matters from the student-conduct process;</li>
<li>creates a process to remove employment letters of warning from academic student-employee personnel files;</li>
<li>means the union will withdraw its unfair practice charge related to student conduct and employee discipline.</li>
</ul>
<span>We believe this agreement is a significant first step toward rebuilding trust. Graduate students are valued members of our scholarly community, they make important contributions to our teaching and research missions, and we want to make sure they are supported while they work toward earning a UC Santa Cruz degree. With this agreement in place, we are committed to working with our graduate students to understand their needs and how we can best support them.</span><br/><br/><strong>A path toward re-employment<br/></strong><span>One of the most important terms of the settlement involves fall-quarter employment eligibility for student employees dismissed from spring-quarter appointments. As UCSC continues to hire academic student employees for fall quarter, the campus and UAW have agreed to mediation and expedited arbitration in August. Expedited hearings for those terminated allows a neutral third party to help campus and UAW resolve these disciplinary actions separately and, if we cannot agree, allows for a quick hearing and decision prior to fall quarter.</span><br/><br/><span>We understand the need for our graduate students to secure academic student employment to support their pursuit of graduate degrees while we also hold firmly the belief that actions that significantly disrupt university operations and have adverse impacts on our students should have consequences.</span><br/><br/><strong>Shifting grade deletions away from student conduct<br/></strong><span>Under the agreement, 75 graduate students who deleted grade information during fall quarter will have their actions resolved as employment-related misconduct instead of as violations of the Code of Student Conduct. Students found responsible for taking part in grade deletion during the fall quarter who received a student conduct-related disciplinary sanction will see those sanctions converted to employee letters of warning. As a step toward rebuilding trust in our campus processes and increasing transparency, the campus will embark on a review of our Code of Student Conduct (academic and non-academic) processes in the upcoming academic year.</span><br/><br/><strong>Removing letters of warning for failing to submit grades<br/></strong><span>UC Santa Cruz and the UAW also agreed on a process for removing letters of warning from employment files. The university will remove letters of warning from the personnel file of any student who submitted 99% or more of their grades for each quarter of the 2019-20 academic year in which they held an academic student employee appointment with grading responsibility. This applies to each academic student employee who received an employment letter of warning or had their conduct discipline commuted to an employment letter of warning, and importantly, allows individuals to start a new academic year without these actions recorded in their personnel file.</span><br/><br/><strong>Unfair practice charges<br/></strong><span>The UAW has agreed to withdraw its unfair practice charges related to student conduct and employee discipline. The University of California and UAW, respectively, have unfair practice charges pending and have agreed to reschedule the hearings prior to fall quarter by mutual agreement.</span><br/><br/><span>Fall quarter will bring its own set of new challenges in the face of the ongoing health and humanitarian crisis across the country. This settlement is a small yet important step for our community, one we believe sets us up for a stronger future together.</span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive and Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3958e1f48072701763b3cba6d1320347"><name>online-resources</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Remote instruction resources and support</title><summary> The remote instruction team is providing updates on instructional resources and available support.</summary><start-date>1594364400000</start-date><display-name>Remote instruction resources and support</display-name><path>/2020/07/online-resources</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/07/online-resources</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1594394993101</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594395034192</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear All,</p>

<h2>Major Updates to Instructional Tools and Resources</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>YuJa</strong> is UCSC&#8217;s new video platform. It can be used to create and curate instructional videos. The first workshop&#8212;which is an overview of the platform, Yuja features (in-video quizzes, captions), and how to embed media into Canvas&#8212;is on June 25 from 10:00&#8211;11:00. You can access the workshop event <a href="https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&amp;tmeid=NGdmdGhlbzE3djZiMGY3OWtnajFnMHJoc3QgZGNvbmFyZEB1Y3NjLmVkdQ&amp;tmsrc=dconard%40ucsc.edu">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Gradescope</strong> is now available and can be directly integrated within Canvas. Gradescope is a grading efficiency tool featuring flexible rubrics and feedback for digital or paper-based assignments, detailed analytics for overall assignments or individual questions, and seamless workflow for multiple instructors or TAs grading simultaneously. <a href="https://its.ucsc.edu/gradescope/">Visit this page</a> for more information about how your course can benefit from using Gradescope. Gradescope workshops will be offered in the summer, dates to be announced.</li>
<li><strong>Zoom Cloud Recording <em>(now available)</em></strong> - Zoom Cloud Recording is now active and on by default for Summer instructors. This means that the next time you click the Record button in your Zoom meeting, you will be prompted with the option to record locally on your computer or to the cloud. Local recordings will be converted at the end of your meeting and stored on your computer. Cloud recordings will start converting at the end of your meeting and uploaded to your Zoom account automatically - an email notification will be sent to you when the recording is ready. Visit <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/sections/200208179-Recording">Zoom&#8217;s support documentation</a> for more information on recording. Cloud recordings will be deleted after 30 days, but see the next bullet for a solution on that.</li>
<li><strong>Zoom Cloud &gt; Yuja</strong> - As a summer instructor, your Zoom cloud recordings will be automatically uploaded into Yuja. This is both for ease of access to share with your students, and so that your Zoom recordings will persist after 30 days. Yuja has unlimited storage, so no worries about recording long lecture sessions. Videos will also automatically be captioned in this process. A couple of tips if you are using Teaching Assistants for Zoom support:
<ul>
<li>Be sure that you, as the instructor, initiate the recordings in Zoom so that they are created and stored in your YuJa account. If you have someone else make the recording, it will not automatically transfer.</li>
<li>If you have a TA that will also need to create recordings of sessions, please have them contact the FITC at <a href="mailto:canvas.help@ucsc.edu">canvas.help@ucsc.edu</a> to request access to Zoom Cloud recording and the YuJa Zoom connector for auto-transfer of their recordings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UCSC Online Education has just released a full redesign of their <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TY4EJEjcMjzhP_62PvtfN4yEmns6qrdAx1jj6sPX_jM/edit">Orientation Module</a>, which provides students with information on how to use Canvas, to access the library, as well as information on the Student Code of Conduct, accessibility, and critical campus resources to ensure that students are supported to be successful in your course. The module can be imported into your course using the instructions linked above.</li>
<li>As a reminder, students will not be able to access your course materials until you publish your course in Canvas, and all of the content items in the course. <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-13030-how-do-i-publish-a-course">Learn more about publishing in Canvas</a>.</li>

Now, for the first time, scientists have determined the complete sequence of a human chromosome from one end to the other (&#8216;telomere to telomere&#8217;) with no gaps and an unprecedented level of accuracy.</p>
<p>The publication of the telomere-to-telomere assembly of a complete human X chromosome <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2547-7">July 14 in <em>Nature</em></a> is a landmark achievement for genomics researchers. Lead author Karen Miga, a research scientist at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute, said the project was made possible by new sequencing technologies that enable &#8220;ultra-long reads,&#8221; such as the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2012/02/nanopore-sequencer.html">nanopore sequencing technology</a> pioneered at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Repetitive DNA sequences are common throughout the genome and have always posed a challenge for sequencing because most technologies produce relatively short &#8220;reads&#8221; of the sequence, which then have to be pieced together like a jigsaw puzzle to assemble the genome. Repetitive sequences yield lots of short reads that look almost identical, like a large expanse of blue sky in a puzzle, with no clues to how the pieces fit together or how many repeats there are.</p>
<p>&#8220;These repeat-rich sequences were once deemed intractable, but now we&#8217;ve made leaps and bounds in sequencing technology,&#8221; Miga said. &#8220;With nanopore sequencing, we get ultra-long reads of hundreds of thousands of base pairs that can span an entire repeat region, so that bypasses some of the challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Filling in the remaining gaps in the human genome sequence opens up new regions of the genome where researchers can search for associations between sequence variations and disease and for other clues to important questions about human biology and evolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re starting to find that some of these regions where there were gaps in the reference sequence are actually among the richest for variation in human populations, so we&#8217;ve been missing a lot of information that could be important to understanding human biology and disease,&#8221; Miga said.</p>
<p><strong>Telomere to telomere</strong></p>
<p>Miga and Adam Phillippy at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), both corresponding authors of the new paper, co-founded the <a href="https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/t2tworkinggroup">Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium</a> to pursue a complete genome assembly after working together on a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/nanopore-genome.html">2018 paper</a> that demonstrated the potential of nanopore technology to produce a complete human genome sequence. That effort used the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencer, which sequences DNA by detecting the change in current flow as single molecules of DNA pass through a tiny hole (a "nanopore") in a membrane.</p>
<p>The new project built on that effort, combining nanopore sequencing with other sequencing technologies from PacBio and Illumina, and optical maps from BioNano Genomics. Using these technologies, the team produced a whole-genome assembly that exceeds all prior human genome assemblies in terms of continuity, completeness, and accuracy, even surpassing the current human reference genome by some metrics.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there were still multiple breaks in the sequence, Miga said. To finish the X chromosome, the team had to manually resolve several gaps in the sequence. Two segmental duplications were resolved with ultra-long nanopore reads that completely spanned the repeats and were uniquely anchored on either side. The remaining break was at the centromere, a notoriously difficult region of repetitive DNA found in every chromosome.</p>
<p>In the X chromosome, the centromere encompasses a region of highly repetitive DNA spanning 3.1 million base pairs (the bases A, C, T, and G form pairs in the DNA double helix and encode genetic information in their sequence). The team was able to identify variants within the repeat sequence to serve as markers, which they used to align the long reads and connect them together to span the entire centromere.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, the idea that we can put together a 3-megabase-size tandem repeat is just mind-blowing. We can now reach these repeat regions covering millions of bases that were previously thought intractable,&#8221; Miga said.</p>
<p><strong>Polishing strategy</strong></p>
<p>The next step was a polishing strategy using data from multiple sequencing technologies to ensure the accuracy of every base in the sequence.</p>
<p>&#8220;We used an iterative process over three different sequencing platforms to polish the sequence and reach a high level of accuracy,&#8221; Miga explained. &#8220;The unique markers provide an anchoring system for the ultra-long reads, and once you anchor the reads, you can use multiple data sets to call each base.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nanopore sequencing, in addition to providing ultra-long reads, can also detect bases that have been modified by methylation, an &#8220;epigenetic&#8221; change that does not alter the sequence but has important effects on DNA structure and gene expression. By mapping patterns of methylation on the X chromosome, the team was able to confirm previous observations and reveal some intriguing trends in methylation patterns within the centromere.</p>
<p>The new human genome sequence, derived from a human cell line called CHM13, closes many gaps in the current reference genome, known as Genome Reference Consortium build 38 (GRCh38).</p>
<p>The T2T consortium is continuing to work toward completion of all of the CHM13 chromosomes. &#8220;It&#8217;s an open consortium, so in many respects this is a community-driven project, with a lot of people dedicating time and resources to it,&#8221; Miga said.</p>
<p>In addition to Miga and Phillippy, the authors of the paper include co-first author Sergey Koren at the National Human Genome Research Institute and scientists at nearly two dozen institutions in the U.S. and U.K., including the University of Washington, Johns Hopkins University, UC San Diego, and the Wellcome Sanger Institute. This work was supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="39c4cffe8072701763b3cba61d25dd6d"><name>stem-diversity</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>STEM Diversity Programs honored by ‘Insight into Diversity’ magazine</title><summary>'Insight into Diversity' magazine has recognized the STEM Diversity Programs at UC Santa Cruz with its 2020 Inspiring Programs in STEM Award. </summary><keywords>Yulianna Ortega</keywords><start-date>1594364400000</start-date><display-name>STEM Diversity Programs honored by ‘Insight into Diversity’ magazine</display-name><path>/2020/07/stem-diversity</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/07/stem-diversity</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1594402066405</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594402442361</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/07/images/award-logo-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/07/images/award-logo-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>award-logo-400.jpg</name><display-name>award-logo-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>72403</file-size><width>400</width><height>335</height></image><image-alt>Award logo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/07/images/award-logo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/07/images/award-logo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>award-logo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>award-logo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23027</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Award logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>Insight into Diversity</em> magazine has recognized the <a href="http://stemdiv.ucsc.edu/">STEM Diversity Programs</a> at UC Santa Cruz with its 2020 Inspiring Programs in STEM Award.</p>
<p>UCSC will be featured along with 49 other recipients in the September 2020 issue of <em>Insight Into Diversity</em> magazine, the largest and oldest diversity and inclusion publication in higher education. The Inspiring Programs in STEM Award honors colleges and universities that encourage and assist students from underrepresented groups to enter the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).</p>
<p>Winners were selected based on efforts to inspire and encourage a new generation of young people to consider careers in STEM through mentoring, teaching, research, and successful programs and initiatives.</p>
<p>Yulianna Ortega, director of the Office of STEM Diversity Programs, praised the dedication of her team of staff, faculty, and students. &#8220;Our work focuses on shaping future leaders that will diversify the multiple facets of science, policy, administration, faculty, and scholarly contributions to our society,&#8221; Ortega said. &#8220;We have the privilege to work with talented and exceptional students every day, and each day we are reminded of why diversity equals excellence.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UCSC STEM Diversity Programs encompass a variety of programs that support underrepresented students in STEM fields. The Office of STEM Diversity Programs is an umbrella office that includes programs funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, as well as state-funded and donor-supported programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that many STEM programs are not always recognized for their success, dedication, and mentorship for underrepresented students,&#8221; said Lenore Pearlstein, owner and publisher of <em>Insight Into Diversity</em> magazine. &#8220;We want to honor the schools and organizations that have created programs that inspire and encourage young people who may currently be in or are interested in a future career in STEM. We are proud to honor these programs as role models to other institutions of higher education and beyond.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3af008688072701763b3cba6bdc098d6"><name>covid-19-planning-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>COVID-19 Planning Update</title><summary>Over the past four months, every member of our Banana Slug community has been impacted by COVID-19.

<p><br/>Over the past four months, every member of our Banana Slug community has been impacted by COVID-19. In spite of the personal impacts of the pandemic, we have seen countless faculty and staff, whether remote or in-person, demonstrate their passion and commitment to our campus mission and to our students. During this time, more than 200 members of our campus community have played an active role in the task teams and work groups charged with recovery and resiliency planning. This communication is an update on those efforts.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Current situation</strong><br/>Coronavirus case numbers in our state and in the counties in which UC Santa Cruz has operations continue to rise. Santa Cruz County surpassed the <a href="https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">500 total cases mark</a> this week, with the number of confirmed cases growing at an elevated rate over the past two weeks. We continue to monitor state and county data as we plan for fall quarter. At this point, all campus operations that can operate remotely will remain remote. California has yet to permit higher education to resume unrestricted in-person instruction and operations. It is unclear when that will happen and what, if any, guidelines will be put in place. <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/06/planning-for-academic-year-2020-2021.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">As communicated by Chancellor Larive in June</a>, if we are permitted to do so by the state, and if local conditions allow, we will offer a small number of laboratory, studio, field study, and field research courses in person this fall. The majority of our classes will be offered remotely or online.</p>
<p>A protocol has been developed to review any additional operations that should be resumed on-site this fall. We are currently working with principal officers across all divisions to identify those operations. We anticipate that employees who can effectively continue working remotely will do so at least until Jan. 4, 2021.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Operational resumption planning and new website</strong><br/>In my <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/06/covid-19-recovery-and-resiliency-planning-update.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">June planning update</a> to campus, I laid out several areas of planning and the implementation of several mitigation measures as we move through summer and prepare for fall quarter. I also referenced the release of our <a href="https://recovery.ucsc.edu/assets/images/draft-resumption-plan.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">campus resumption plan</a>. This plan has now been posted and is available on our new <a href="https://recovery.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UCSC COVID-19 recovery website</a>. The resumption plan is considered a living document, and will be updated regularly as planning progresses, conditions change, and our plans adapt. In addition to the full plan, <a href="https://recovery.ucsc.edu/assets/images/ucsc-recovery-resiliency-briefing-book.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a briefing booklet</a> is available that covers the key elements of the plan and campus mitigations. As with the larger plan, the briefing book will also be adapted as conditions change.</p>
<p>In addition to these planning materials, the new recovery website provides an array of resources and information on support for students, faculty and staff. We hope this new layout will better serve the information needs of our campus.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Information sessions</strong> <br/>Over the next three months, we will conduct regular information sessions to keep the campus community updated on planning efforts. Some sessions will be broad in topic and intended for all employees, while others will be targeted in topic and population. The first information session is tentatively scheduled for the week of July 27, and will provide an update on planning efforts and the six areas of campus mitigation: symptom checks, training, worksite plans, testing, compliance, and the Slug Strong actions that every member of the community can take. Weblink information and the form for submitting questions will be forthcoming in Tuesday Newsday and posted on the recovery website.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Slug Strong: Do your part</strong><br/>Every member of the UC Santa Cruz community will have a critical role to play in our campus efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19. On the new website, we have outlined the six <a href="https://ucsc-recovery.netlify.app/returning-to-campus/do-your-part/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Slug Strong</a> actions each of us can take.<br/>Thank you so much for everything you do to support our campus community as we continue down the path of recovery and resilience.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for everything you do to support our campus community as we continue down the path of recovery and

Rutland,</i></span><span><i> </i>a<i> </i></span><span>new documentary by UCSC associate professor of film and digital media Jennifer Maytorena Taylor, is an exploration of the</span><span>&#160;multiple problems now faced by rural America&#8212;most notably the opioid epidemic, income inequality, racism, and xenophobia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Shot over three years in the small blue-collar town of Rutland, Vermont, the 91-minute feature recently had its virtual month-long premiere at the Hot Docs Film Festival in Toronto.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The film portrays Rutland as a microcosm of today&#8217;s divided America. It follows the story of Stacie Griffin, a women in recovery trying to raise her kids and stay off heroin, as the town deals with the spiraling effects of the opioid epidemic.</span></p>
<p><span>The town&#8217;s troubles are compounded when Rutland&#8217;s mayor takes the controversial step of accepting 100 Syrian refugees as part of an </span><span>an attempt to bring new life to an economically struggling and predominantly white community. </span><span>It tears apart the city of 15,000, unleashing extreme partisan anger, bitterness and resentment.</span></p>
<p><span>But despite being marginalized for her addiction and poverty, Stacie eventually resists the white rage that surrounds her and emerges as an unexpected town leader, identifying with the new refugees through the intense daily struggles that she shares with them.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;</span><span>By offering viewers an open-ended story with flawed, human protagonists and with a very intimate and stripped down verit&#233; style, I hope the film will spark dialogue and engagement about the human lives behind the headlines about the opioid epidemic, the refugee crisis, and rural America,&#8221; said Taylor.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;</span><span>As the film explores how the town of Rutland is reckoning with change and its persistent yet often unspoken class divisions, I especially want to challenge narratives and assumptions&#8212;from both conservative and liberal points of view&#8212;about how income inequality factors into our current political and ideological polarization.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;</span><span>Over the course of the film, Stacie moves from some resistance against refugee resettlement to full support of welcoming newcomers into her community, and seeing their fates as intertwined with her own,&#8221; she added. &#8220;If Stacie can see herself in people who are apparently so different from her&#8212;while also struggling with the gravest of personal and economic disadvantages&#8212;what excuse does anyone else have?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>As director of graduate studies</strong> in UCSC&#8217;s Social Documentation M.F.A. Program, Taylor was able to use her film as an example in teaching the storytelling and logistical aspects of creating a documentary film.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I always share examples of my work and work processes with students in both graduate and undergraduate classes,&#8221; said Taylor. &#8220;For example, this spring, as we moved to remote classes, I was able to get several members of the <i>For the Love of Rutland</i> team to do master classes via Zoom&#8212;including the editor, the sound designer, and the composer of the film&#8217;s original score.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Our students are so curious and engaged, and ask so many good questions, that working with them creates a really great sort of feedback loop between teaching filmmaking and making films myself,&#8221; she added. &#8220;It keeps me on my toes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Taylor recently presented </span><span>at an online workshop on film music for the Sundance Institute. She is also teaching a virtual course this summer for Sundance on documentary film storytelling.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Over the years I&#8217;ve served on the documentary jury at the Festival, have participated in several Sundance Labs with different film projects, and very fortunately have received funding, fellowships, and lots of meaningful support from the Sundance Documentary Film Institute for my work&#8212;including this latest film,&#8221; Taylor noted.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;</span><span>Members of the Institute staff are also very generous with their time and often do guest appearances in my classes at UCSC to talk about film funding and professional development.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Taylor also has a number of new exciting projects in the works.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;</span><span>I&#8217;m working with Latino Public Broadcasting over the summer to help create a new series about the lives of essential workers, featuring short films made by emerging filmmakers like our own film and digital media alums,&#8221; said Taylor.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;</span><span>I&#8217;ve also got two new documentary projects underway,&#8221; she added. &#8220;One is about the science and ideology of music and sound, and the other is an update to a piece my frequent collaborator Mustafa Davis and I made a few years ago for <i>The Talk</i>, a PBS special about how families of color deal with police violence.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/carmel-festival-documentary.html</url><title>Carmel

challenges of COVID-19</article-subhead><article-text><p>CITRIS and the Banatao Institute at UC Santa Cruz is providing seed funding for three innovative projects to address the challenges caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The projects, selected for CITRIS UCSC&#8217;s second annual Campus Seed Funding Program, range from educational technology for remote learning to robotic testing platforms and a senior-friendly online telepresence system.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were excited to see the diverse and creative range of projects this year, from work addressing educational challenges to health and community issues,&#8221; said CITRIS UCSC Campus Director J.J. Garcia-Luna-Acevez, distinguished professor of computer science and engineering. &#8220;The three finalists chosen by the review committee all hold great promise to help us deal with the new reality this global pandemic has brought and prepare more effectively for any similar future crises.&#8221;</p>
<p>The CITRIS UCSC Campus Seed Funding program provides funding up to $40,000 for individual projects that use information technology to solve a significant social challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Remote learning</strong></p>
<p>Experiential, project-based courses face special challenges with the shift toward remote learning during the pandemic. Both mentorship and collaboration become significantly harder in a remote setting, explained David Lee, assistant professor of computational media in the Baskin School of Engineering. Lee&#8217;s project addresses this challenge through the use of digitally-supported organizational structures for scaffolding experiential learning.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is to organize learning after the workplace, with a project goal for the course decomposed into a hierarchy of small experiential roles representing smaller scopes of work,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;In this project, we aim to build on a proof-of-concept to deliver a full course and to develop generalizable principles and patterns for creating a micro-role-based curriculum.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robotic testing platform</strong></p>
<p>COVID-19 testing in the United States has run into a number of bottlenecks, and a shortage of high-throughput automated machines that can perform hundreds of tests at once is now rapidly emerging. Ali Yanik, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering, and Rebecca DuBois, associate professor of biomolecular engineering, are working to develop a low-cost, scalable, open-source robotics platform for high-throughput testing.</p>
<p>Automated testing machines are highly sophisticated, difficult to manufacture, and expensive. Open-source liquid handling robots are more affordable, but cannot readily replace the more sophisticated high-throughput machines, Yanik explained. &#8220;Molecular assays require rigorous extraction and intricate enzymatic processes that are far too complicated to perform using low-cost open-source robotics,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Yanik&#8217;s lab has developed a novel assay technology that enables ultrasensitive viral antigen detection using immunoassay kinetics. The researchers aim to merge this assay with low-cost open-source robotics to demonstrate a proof-of-concept high-throughput scalable platform for COVID-19 testing. &#8220;We have successfully manufactured recombinant SARS-CoV-2 antigens and monoclonal antibodies against them, and we have all the necessary resources to complete the proof-of-concept part of this project through CITRIS funding,&#8221; DuBois said.</p>
<p><strong>Equitable health technologies</strong></p>
<p>Shelter-in-place orders during the pandemic have deepened social isolation for many seniors, who already faced difficulties in accessing food and health care as well as maintaining social ties. Sri Kurniawan, professor and chair of computational media, and Nancy Chen, professor of anthropology, will investigate the use of health technologies to enhance social interactions for elderly members within essential-worker communities while creating new career opportunities for minority youths.</p>
<p>&#8220;We plan to collaborate with Santa Cruz County non-profit organizations to determine guidelines for telemedicine technologies to assist seniors and identify the most pressing technological barriers,&#8221; Kurniawan said.</p>
<p>The researchers aim to develop a senior-friendly multiplatform online telepresence system that facilitates intergenerational communication within the essential-worker communities of Pajaro Valley (currently a medical desert). The system will enable online and remote physical health assistance, tutorials for seniors to take full advantage of online services, and social interactions to alleviate social isolation.</p>
<p>The Center of Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) is a multi-campus initiative focused on research and emerging technologies. Established in 2001, CITRIS and the Banatao Institute leverages the interdisciplinary research strengths of UC Santa Cruz, Berkeley, Davis and Merced to advance the University of California's mission. The institute was created to shorten the pipeline between world-class laboratory research and the development of impact applications, platforms, companies, and new industries. Together with many public and private partners, the institute is shaping the future of technology in ways that cross traditional boundaries.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4fa39b818072701763b3cba69c412280"><name>message-visas</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New federal guidance regarding international students</title><summary>I am pleased to report that the Trump administration has reversed course on a sudden policy change that threatened to strip international students of their U.S. visas if their fall-quarter coursework was entirely online.</summary><start-date>1594710000000</start-date><display-name>New federal guidance regarding international students</display-name><path>/2020/07/message-visas</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/07/message-visas</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1594768989034</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1595460047541</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am pleased to report that the Trump administration has reversed course on a sudden policy change that threatened to strip international students of their U.S. visas if their fall-quarter coursework was entirely online.</p>
<p>The proposed change, announced July 6, prompted immediate lawsuits from multiple universities including the University of California. On Tuesday, the Trump administration and Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the first two universities to file lawsuits, reached a resolution. The agreement reinstates a policy implemented in March giving international students flexibility to take all their classes online and remain legally in the country with F-1 visas.</p>
<p>The July 6 announcement was abrupt and outside of normal administrative procedures. Most importantly, it created great anxiety and stress for our international students during what is already a difficult time. The health and well-being of our students remains our top priority.</p>
<p>University of California Board of Regents Chair John A. P&#233;rez and President Janet Napolitano issued a joint statement today on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security decision to rescind the directive.</p>
<p>&#8220;This sudden reversal by ICE is a win for common sense and for public health. Revoking the visas of international students in the midst of a pandemic would have put students&#8217; futures, their communities&#8217; health, and the U.S. economy in further jeopardy. College and university leaders must be allowed to make decisions about campus operations that are guided by public health experts &#8212; not by a hastily drafted, arbitrary and mean-spirited policy.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5328734a8072701763b3cba69410e608"><name>diana-powell</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astrophysics graduate student Diana Powell wins 2020 Ford Fellowship</title><summary>Powell won a Ford Foundation Dissertation Fellowship to support her work as she completes her Ph.D. thesis on exoplanets.</summary><start-date>1594796400000</start-date><display-name>Astrophysics graduate student Diana Powell wins 2020 Ford Fellowship</display-name><path>/2020/07/diana-powell</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/07/diana-powell</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1594828026673</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594828431450</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/07/images/diana-powell-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/07/images/diana-powell-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>diana-powell-350.jpg</name><display-name>diana-powell-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>98848</file-size><width>350</width><height>394</height></image><image-alt>Diana Powell</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/07/images/diana-powell-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/07/images/diana-powell-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>diana-powell-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>diana-powell-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>48573</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Diana Powell</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Diana Powell</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Diana Powell, an astrophysics graduate student at UC Santa Cruz, was among 132 outstanding scholars awarded fellowships in the 2020 Ford Foundation Fellowship Programs administered by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.</p>
<p>Powell won a Ford Foundation Dissertation Fellowship to support her work as she completes her Ph.D. thesis on exoplanets (planets around other stars). Her research focuses on understanding planet formation and planetary atmospheres, and she has been working with Ruth Murray-Clay, Gunderson Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics, and Xi Zhang, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eventually, we want to understand which planets are most likely to host life, and the techniques I am developing to study planetary atmospheres can tell us how Earth-like a planet is,&#8221; Powell said. &#8220;My research also addresses long-standing problems in planet formation theory.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Ford Fellowship programs seek to increase the diversity of the nation&#8217;s college and university faculties by increasing their ethnic and racial diversity, to maximize the educational benefits of diversity, and to increase the number of professors who can and will use diversity as a resource for enriching the education of all students.</p>
<p>Powell, when she graduates in spring of 2021, will become the 22nd Black woman to receive a Ph.D. in astronomy or astrophysics. As a UCSC graduate student, she has been active in mentoring undergraduates as well as graduate student peers. In her first year, she won the Graduate Division&#8217;s Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award, as well as her department&#8217;s Excellence in Mentoring Award.</p>
<p>Powell worked with Murray-Clay to develop a new &#8220;Introduction to Research&#8221; course for first-year and transfer students interested in physics, served as head mentor for the course, then went on to develop a mentorship program for undergraduates in physics and won a grant to institutionalize the program. She also established the first graduate student branch of LUMA, a peer mentoring group for women of color in astronomy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are just beginning to see the positive impacts of the mentoring programs I have worked on at UCSC, and I am confident that the long-term impacts on the fields of astronomy and physics will be substantial,&#8221; Powell said. &#8220;I am determined to expand and refine these programs, while implementing other novel ways of increasing diversity in academia, throughout my career.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a Ford Fellow, Powell is following in the footsteps of her father, Philip Powell, who was part of the first cohort of Ford Foundation Postdoctoral Fellows. Now retired, he studied child psychology, focusing on gifted children, and was a professor of educational psychology at the University of Texas, Austin.</p>
<p>Powell said she first became interested in astronomy as a child in Texas, where the clear night skies of central Texas and the support of her parents helped foster her newfound passion. After earning a B.A. in astrophysics and physics at Harvard University, she chose UC Santa Cruz for graduate school, she said, because it is the only top-ranked astrophysics program at a minority-serving institution.</p>
<p>Powell&#8217;s research on exoplanets involves understanding the microphysics of small particles. For example, planet formation occurs in disks of material around young stars, where small dust particles evolve in the presence of gas to form the building blocks of planets. These initial stages of planet formation remain poorly understood, and Powell&#8217;s models provide new insights into the parameters that determine the final composition of planets.</p>
<p>In planetary atmospheres, the small particles Powell studies are the components of clouds. Clouds not only play an important role in regulating a planet&#8217;s climate, they also strongly affect astronomers&#8217; observations of planetary atmospheres. &#8220;I model clouds in planetary atmospheres to explain their observed properties and make predictions of what we will see with the next generation of space telescopes,&#8221; Powell explained.</p>
<p>The most exciting aspect of the Ford Fellowship, she said, is becoming a part of the broader community of Ford Fellows. &#8220;It connects me with other fellows, and as a Black woman, it&#8217;s nice to see Black professors at different stages in their careers,&#8221; Powell said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a networking community that can help me on my path.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5388b8fe8072701763b3cba6f5f3e359"><name>illegal-fishing</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Report exposes rampant illegal fishing in North Korean waters</title><summary>Ground-breaking study reveals hundreds of vessels fishing illegally in one of the world’s most contested ocean regions, contravening UN sanctions and fueling overfishing.</summary><keywords>Katherine Seto</keywords><start-date>1595440800000</start-date><display-name>Report exposes rampant illegal fishing in North Korean waters</display-name><path>/2020/07/illegal-fishing</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/07/illegal-fishing</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1594834335970</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1595441369322</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/07/images/chinese-fleet-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/07/images/chinese-fleet-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>chinese-fleet-500.jpg</name><display-name>chinese-fleet-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>66007</file-size><width>500</width><height>210</height></image><image-alt>Chinese fishing boats in harbor</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/07/images/nkorean-vessel-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/07/images/nkorean-vessel-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nkorean-vessel-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>nkorean-vessel-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20273</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>North Korean fishing boat</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Chinese fleets anchored in Sadong port, Ulleung-do, South Korea, due to bad weather in North Korean waters.

<p>Katherine Seto, assistant professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz, is a coauthor of the study, <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/30/eabb1197">published July 22 in the journal <em>Science Advances</em></a>. The investigation found more than 900 vessels of Chinese origin in 2017, and 700 in 2018, violated United Nations sanctions by fishing in North Korean waters. The vessels likely caught almost as much Pacific flying squid as Japan and South Korea combined&#8212;more than 160,000 metric tons worth over $440 million in 2017 and 2018.</p>
<p>&#8220;The scale of the fleet involved in this illegal fishing is about one-third the size of China's entire distant-water fishing fleet. It is the largest known case of illegal fishing perpetrated by a single industrial fleet operating in another nation&#8217;s waters,&#8221; said Jaeyoon Park, senior data scientist at Global Fishing Watch and co-lead author of the study. &#8220;By synthesizing data from multiple satellite sensors, we created an unprecedented, robust picture of fishing activity in a notoriously opaque region.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following North Korea&#8217;s testing of ballistic missiles, the UN Security Council adopted resolutions in 2017 to sanction the country, and some of these prohibit foreign fishing.</p>
<p>The detected vessels originate from China and are assumed to be owned and operated by Chinese interests. However, because these vessels often do not carry appropriate papers, they are likely &#8220;three-no boats&#8221;&#8212;operating without official Chinese authority and with no registration, flag, or license.</p>
<p><strong>Devastating impact </strong></p>
<p>The study also found about 3,000 North Korean vessels fished illegally in Russian waters in 2018.</p>
<p>&#8220;Competition from the industrial Chinese trawlers is likely displacing the North Korean fishers, pushing them into neighboring Russian waters,&#8221; said study co-lead Jungsam Lee of the Korea Maritime Institute. &#8220;The North Koreans&#8217; smaller wood boats are ill-equipped for this long-distance travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hundreds of North Korean boats have washed ashore on Japanese and Russian coasts in recent years. These incidents often involve starvation and deaths, and many fishing villages on North Korea&#8217;s eastern coast have become known as &#8220;widows&#8217; villages.&#8221;</p>
<p>"The consequences of this shifting effort for North Korean small-scale fishers are profound, and represent an alarming and potentially growing human rights concern," said UCSC&#8217;s Seto.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue vessels </strong></p>
<p>The study claims the previously unidentified vessels pose a huge challenge for squid stock management, with reported catches plummeting by 80 percent and 82 percent in South Korean and Japanese waters respectively since 2003. Pacific flying squid is South Korea&#8217;s top seafood by production value, one of the top five seafoods consumed in Japan and, until recent sanctions, was the third largest North Korean export.</p>
<p>Disagreement over boundaries in the waters between the Koreas, Japan and Russia have prevented joint fisheries management and hampered national efforts due to a lack of comprehensive stock assessments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Illegal fishing in these waters is a very serious matter in Japan, and the lack of shared data and management is a major challenge considering the critical importance of squid in the region,&#8221; said Masanori Miyahara, president of the Japan Fisheries Research and Education Agency. &#8220;We must face this challenge using the evidence provided by this study and other credible science.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Satellite technologies </strong></p>
<p>The study used four satellite technologies to illuminate the dark fleets. Automatic identification systems (AIS)&#8212;a collision avoidance system that constantly transmits a vessel&#8217;s location at sea&#8212;provide detailed vessel information, but are used by only a fraction of vessels. The study added radar images, which can identify large metal vessels and penetrate clouds; night-time imaging, which picks up the presence of fishing vessels using lights to attract catch or conduct operations at night; and high-resolution optical imagery, which offers the best visual &#8220;proof&#8221; of vessel activity and type. These technologies have never before been combined to publicly reveal the activities and estimated catches of entire fleets at this scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;These novel insights are now possible thanks to advances in machine learning and the rapidly growing volume of high-resolution, high-frequency imagery that was unavailable even a couple of years ago,&#8221; said David Kroodsma, research and innovation director at Global Fishing Watch and coauthor of the study. &#8220;We&#8217;ve shown we can track industrial fishing vessels that are not broadcasting their locations.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Inter-Korean cooperation</strong></p>
<p>The 2018 inter-Korean summits underlined the need to build peace through cooperation on the waters, create a joint fisheries management area, and address illegal fishing. Achieving these laudable ambitions will rely on unbiased information that all sides can trust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Global fisheries have long been dominated by a culture of unnecessary confidentiality and concealment. Achieving a comprehensive view of fishing activity is an important step toward truly sustainable and cooperative fisheries management, and satellite monitoring is a key part of the solution,&#8221; said coauthor Quentin Hanich of the Australian National Centre for Ocean Resources and Security (ANCORS) at the University of Wollongong. &#8220;This analysis represents the beginning of a new era in ocean management and transparency.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study was itself an example of international cooperation, with scientists from Japan, South Korea, Australia and the United States collaborating to reveal fishing activity in the region.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="549a27e08072701763b3cba69825dc70"><name>galaxy-quenching</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>How galaxies die: New insights into the quenching of star formation</title><summary>A simple model explains a wide range of observations by describing a contest between galaxy halos and their central black holes that eventually turns off star formation.</summary><keywords>Sandra Faber</keywords><start-date>1594882800000</start-date><display-name>How galaxies die: New insights into the quenching of star formation</display-name><path>/2020/07/galaxy-quenching</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/07/galaxy-quenching</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1594852255683</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594911664257</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/07/images/galaxies-graph-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/07/images/galaxies-graph-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>galaxies-graph-500.jpg</name><display-name>galaxies-graph-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>72041</file-size><width>500</width><height>369</height></image><image-alt>Graph of galaxy mass and black hole mass</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/07/images/galaxies-graph-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/07/images/galaxies-graph-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>galaxies-graph-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>galaxies-graph-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17142</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>A star-forming galaxy</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>A new theory explains how black holes grow as a function of galaxy mass and eventually quench star formation in their host galaxies.

Although many theories have been proposed to explain this process, known as &#8220;quenching,&#8221; there is still no consensus on a satisfactory model.</p>
<p>Now, an international team led by Sandra Faber, professor emerita of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, has proposed a new model that successfully explains a wide range of observations about galaxy structure, supermassive black holes, and the quenching of star formation. The researchers presented their findings in a paper <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab9633">published July 1 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em></a>.</p>
<p>The model supports one of the leading ideas about quenching which attributes it to black hole &#8220;feedback,&#8221; the energy released into a galaxy and its surroundings from a central supermassive black hole as matter falls into the black hole and feeds its growth. This energetic feedback heats, ejects, or otherwise disrupts the galaxy&#8217;s gas supply, preventing the infall of gas from the galaxy&#8217;s halo to feed star formation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is that in star-forming galaxies, the central black hole is like a parasite that ultimately grows and kills the host,&#8221; Faber explained. &#8220;That&#8217;s been said before, but we haven&#8217;t had clear rules to say when a black hole is big enough to shut down star formation in its host galaxy, and now we have quantitative rules that actually work to explain our observations.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Size and mass</strong></p>
<p>The basic idea involves the relationship between the mass of the stars in a galaxy (stellar mass), how spread out those stars are (the galaxy&#8217;s radius), and the mass of the central black hole. For star-forming galaxies with a given stellar mass, the density of stars in the center of the galaxy correlates with the radius of the galaxy so that galaxies with bigger radii have lower central stellar densities. Assuming that the mass of the central black hole scales with the central stellar density, star-forming galaxies with larger radii (at a given stellar mass) will have lower black-hole masses.</p>
<p>What that means, Faber explained, is that larger galaxies (those with larger radii for a given stellar mass) have to evolve further and build up a higher stellar mass before their central black holes can grow large enough to quench star formation. Thus, small-radius galaxies quench at lower masses than large-radius galaxies.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the new insight, that if galaxies with large radii have smaller black holes at a given stellar mass, and if black hole feedback is important for quenching, then large-radius galaxies have to evolve further,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If you put together all these assumptions, amazingly, you can reproduce a large number of observed trends in the structural properties of galaxies.&#8221;</p>
<p>This explains, for example, why more massive quenched galaxies have higher central stellar densities, larger radii, and larger central black holes.</p>
<p>Based on this model, the researchers concluded that quenching begins when the total energy emitted from the black hole is approximately four times the gravitational binding energy of the gas in the galactic halo. The binding energy refers to the gravitational force that holds the gas within the halo of dark matter enveloping the galaxy. Quenching is complete when the total energy emitted from the black hole is twenty times the binding energy of the gas in the galactic halo.</p>
<p><strong>Physical processes</strong></p>
<p>Faber emphasized that the model does not yet explain in detail the physical mechanisms involved in the quenching of star formation. &#8220;The key physical processes that this simple theory evokes are not yet understood,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The virtue of this, though, is that having simple rules for each step in the process challenges theorists to come up with physical mechanisms that explain each step.&#8221;</p>
<p>Astronomers are accustomed to thinking in terms of diagrams that plot the relations between different properties of galaxies and show how they change over time. These diagrams reveal the dramatic differences in structure between star-forming and quenched galaxies and the sharp boundaries between them. Because star formation emits a lot of light at the blue end of the color spectrum, astronomers refer to &#8220;blue&#8221; star-forming galaxies, &#8220;red&#8221; quiescent galaxies, and the &#8220;green valley&#8221; as the transition between them. Which stage a galaxy is in is revealed by its star formation rate.</p>
<p>One of the study&#8217;s conclusions is that the growth rate of black holes must change as galaxies evolve from one stage to the next. The observational evidence suggests that most of the black hole growth occurs in the green valley when galaxies are beginning to quench.</p>
<p>&#8220;The black hole seems to be unleashed just as star formation slows down,&#8221; Faber said. &#8220;This was a revelation, because it explains why black hole masses in star-forming galaxies follow one scaling law, while black holes in quenched galaxies follow another scaling law. That makes sense if black hole mass grows rapidly while in the green valley.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>CANDELS</strong></p>
<p>Faber and her collaborators have been discussing these issues for many years. Since 2010, Faber has co-led a major Hubble Space Telescope galaxy survey program (<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2010/03/3619.html"><span>CANDELS</span></a>, the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey), which produced the data used in this study. In analyzing the CANDELS data, she has worked closely with a team led by Joel Primack, UCSC professor emeritus of physics, which developed the <a href="http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/Bolshoi.html"><span>Bolshoi cosmological simulation</span></a> of the evolution of the dark matter halos in which galaxies form. These halos provide the scaffolding on which the theory builds the early star-forming phase of galaxy evolution before quenching.</p>
<p>The central ideas in the paper emerged from analyses of CANDELS data and first struck Faber about four years ago. &#8220;It suddenly leaped out at me, and I realized if we put all these things together&#8212;if galaxies had a simple trajectory in radius versus mass, and if black hole energy needs to overcome halo binding energy&#8212;it can explain all these slanted boundaries in the structural diagrams of galaxies,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>At the time, Faber was making frequent trips to China, where she has been involved in research collaborations and other activities. She was a visiting professor at Shanghai Normal University, where she met first author Zhu Chen. Chen came to UC Santa Cruz in 2017 as a visiting researcher and began working with Faber to develop these ideas about galaxy quenching.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is mathematically very good, better than me, and she did all of the calculations for this paper,&#8221; Faber said.</p>
<p>Faber also credited her longtime collaborator David Koo, UCSC professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics, for first focusing attention on the central densities of galaxies as a key to the growth of central black holes.</p>
<p>Among the puzzles explained by this new model is a striking difference between our Milky Way galaxy and its very similar neighbor Andromeda. &#8220;The Milky Way and Andromeda have almost the same stellar mass, but Andromeda&#8217;s black hole is almost 50 times bigger than the Milky Way&#8217;s,&#8221; Faber said. &#8220;The idea that black holes grow a lot in the green valley goes a long way toward explaining this mystery. The Milky Way is just entering the green valley and its black hole is still small, whereas Andromeda is just exiting so its black hole has grown much bigger, and it is also more quenched than the Milky Way.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Faber, Chen, Koo, and Primack, the coauthors of the paper include researchers at some two dozen institutions in seven countries. This work was funded by grants from NASA and the National Science Foundation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="58a0da6a8072701763b3cba6573508b6"><name>admissions-strong-diverse</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz admits a strong, diverse cohort for fall</title><summary>Nearly a third of admitted first-year students earned a GPA above 4.13 and 55 percent earned a GPA between 3.6 and 4.12.

<p>The work has succeeded with UC Santa Cruz admitting a cohort of students that reflects excellence and diversity. Nearly a third of admitted first-year students earned a GPA above 4.13 and 55 percent earned a GPA between 3.6 and 4.12. UC Santa Cruz also significantly increased the number of students admitted from low-income families, underrepresented groups, and those who will be the first in their family to earn a four-year degree.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz last year was ranked as a leading university for <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/09/usnwr-social-mobility.html">social mobility</a>, just before it was <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/11/aau.html">invited into the highly-respected Association of American Universities</a>, an organization comprised of the nation&#8217;s top research universities. Together, the dual honors underscore the campus&#8217;s excellence in research and dedication to student achievement and success.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our admitted cohort of students has already proven to be talented, well-prepared, and ready to take on whatever comes their way,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;Our faculty and staff are dedicated to providing a vibrant and engaging experience for our new first-year students and transfer students, who have shown incredible strength and determination in pursuing their education despite all the challenges created by a global pandemic.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than 12,000 first-generation college students from California were admitted this year, and 11,895 of the admitted students are from low-income families, according to <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/content-analysis/ug-admissions/ug-pages/admissions.html">preliminary data released</a> by the UC Office of the President.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz faculty ensure applicants are fully reviewed and assessed for their achievements within the context of their opportunities.</p>
<p>Underscoring its commitment to providing access to a high-quality education, UC Santa Cruz offered admission to a record number of California students for fall 2020.</p>
<p>The campus extended admission offers to more than 27,000 California seniors, a 35 percent increase over the previous year, and to more than 7,100 students attending a California community college, an 11 percent increase over the previous year.</p>
<p>The racial and ethnic diversity of admitted students increased this year. UC Santa Cruz extended offers to more than 1,100 African American high school seniors from California&#8212;a 42 percent increase from the previous year. Offers to first-year Chicanx/Latinx first-year students increased by 45 percent.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz continued its regional and statewide outreach efforts to increase interest and applications from transfer students who are seeking a four-year degree. Providing access for California community college students further diversifies our community.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz takes pride in creating a learning environment that supports cultural and geographic diversity. In support of that, the campus admitted 5,447 international first-year students and 3,248 first-year students from other states.</p>
<p>The broad diversity California, international, and out-of-state first-year and transfer students bring to campus enhances the community through their varied experiences and perspectives.</p>
<p>Like other University of California campuses, UC Santa Cruz is focused on supporting the health and well being of its campus community. The campus is planning to offer most of its fall courses through remote instruction, with a small number of in-person learning opportunities when fall classes start on October 1.</p>
<p>Incoming students will participate in a robust virtual Welcome Week intended to connect and engage students with each other and the campus. Welcome Week is a continuation of the Slug Orientation online courses, and is designed to further expose new frosh and transfers to vital resources that will support them in their academic and social transition. Through the mandatory college and major advising presentations they will meet staff and faculty from their affiliated college and major. During this week students will have many opportunities to meet other students via virtual activities and gatherings, be exposed to student clubs and organizations, and attend workshops that will connect them to work and internship opportunities.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-admission-california-students-all-time-record-high</url><title>UC admission of California students at all-time record high</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5952a8088072701763b3cba6cfe2a9da"><name>nlp-director</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Adwait Ratnaparkhi appointed executive director of Natural Language Processing program</title><summary>The Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz has appointed Adwait Ratnaparkhi, former director of voice and natural language understanding R&amp;D at Roku, as executive director of the new master’s degree program in Natural Language Processing.</summary><start-date>1594882800000</start-date><display-name>Adwait Ratnaparkhi appointed executive director of Natural Language Processing program</display-name><path>/2020/07/nlp-director</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/07/nlp-director</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1594931455978</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594931621027</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Appointments</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>James McGirk</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcgirk@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/07/images/adwait-ratnaparkhi.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/07/images/adwait-ratnaparkhi.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>adwait-ratnaparkhi.jpg</name><display-name>adwait-ratnaparkhi.jpg</display-name><file-size>42997</file-size><width>321</width><height>321</height></image><image-alt>Adwait Ratnaparkhi</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/07/images/adwait-ratnaparkhi-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/07/images/adwait-ratnaparkhi-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>adwait-ratnaparkhi-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>adwait-ratnaparkhi-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17657</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Adwait Ratnaparkhi</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Adwait Ratnaparkhi</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz has appointed Adwait Ratnaparkhi, former director of voice and natural language understanding R&amp;D at Roku, as executive director of the new master&#8217;s degree program in Natural Language Processing.</p>
<p>Ratnaparkhi has over 20 years of experience as a researcher and manager at companies such as IBM, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Nuance, and at startups such as 33Across, where he served as chief scientist. He holds a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Pennsylvania and a B.S.E. in computer science from Princeton University. At Roku, Ratnaparkhi developed natural language understanding and conversational AI technologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve spent a long time in Silicon Valley hiring natural language processing engineers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think I can turn that experience around, designing a curriculum that will prepare students to get those jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Natural language processing (NLP) involves creating computer programs that can understand, generate, or learn from human language. Chatbots and voice assistants created with NLP technology mimic the way humans communicate with one another, allowing people to more quickly and comfortably adapt to new devices or software.</p>
<p>Ratnaparkhi predicts demand for NLP tools will increase rapidly as new industries embrace the technology. He said he foresees a proliferation of smaller, customized voice assistants that will require NLP engineers and programmers.</p>
<p>&#8220;My other goal for the program is to prepare students for the unknown,&#8221; Ratnaparkhi said. &#8220;I want our students to be able to enter a new realm and create an artificial intelligence from scratch.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is becoming an important center of NLP expertise. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of great NLP work being done here,&#8221; Ratnaparkhi said. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to join Professors Marilyn Walker and Jeffrey Flannigan. With the existing NLP research happening in the Ph.D. program, there&#8217;s a critical mass of interesting synergies that can happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The M.S. degree program in natural language processing is a one-year program, beginning in the fall quarter. The program includes a three-quarter capstone project in which students will receive real-world experience working in small groups on an industry-relevant, challenging NLP problem.</p>
<p>Ratnaparkhi will direct the capstone project, reach out to industry and establish partnerships, lead marketing and student outreach efforts, and teach courses as a lecturer.</p>
<p>Classes will be located at the UCSC Silicon Valley Campus once the county&#8217;s shelter-in-place order is lifted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really in the heart of the action here, within arm&#8217;s reach of the major AI companies, so it&#8217;s easy for students to reach out for internships or to make industrial collaborations,&#8221; Ratnaparkhi said.</p>

<p>Friedlaender, an associate researcher in the <a href="https://ims.ucsc.edu/">Institute of Marine Sciences</a> at UC Santa Cruz, quickly assembled a team to begin collecting blubber samples from humpback whales in the bay, which the scientists could use to measure the whales&#8217; stress hormones. At the same time, he applied to the National Science Foundation (NSF) for funding through the NSF&#8217;s Rapid Response Research (RAPID) program, which has now awarded the team a $100,000 research grant.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is such an amazing opportunity,&#8221; Friedlaender said. &#8220;We can measure stress hormones in the blubber, we can get data on ship traffic, and there are hydrophones that continuously record acoustic data in the bay. We want to collect samples from whales during this period of reduced noise, and then go out again at the same time next year and compare stress hormone levels in relation to changes in human use of the bay.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hydrophones are deployed by the <a href="https://montereybay.noaa.gov/">Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary</a> and by the <a href="https://www.mbari.org/">Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute</a> (MBARI) as part of its Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS) observatory. Other partners in the project include the <a href="https://www.marinemammalcenter.org/">Marine Mammal Center</a>, Jeremy Goldbogen&#8217;s group at Stanford&#8217;s <a href="https://hopkinsmarinestation.stanford.edu/">Hopkins Marine Station</a>, and <a href="https://www.caoceanalliance.org/">California Ocean Alliance</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were able to collect more than 40 blubber samples in April and May when there was relatively little noise in the environment,&#8221; Friedlaender said. &#8220;Because we got a lot of samples, we can see how hormones vary among males and females, and when we go out again next year we&#8217;ll be sampling the same population and hopefully some of the same individuals.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the hormone analyses, Friedlaender&#8217;s lab will also perform genetic analyses to determine the sex and identities of individual whales.</p>
<p>During the period when the researchers were collecting biopsy samples, he said, all recreational boating and whale watching trips had stopped, and commercial ship traffic was also probably reduced to some extent, although he has not yet looked at the shipping data.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know the noise has been reduced, and a year from now we can see what things changed the most, or alternatively what didn&#8217;t change. It may be that ongoing commercial shipping was still causing stress even in the absence of other changes in boating,&#8221; Friedlaender said.</p>
<p>The results of the study will not only help scientists understand how much stress whales experience from different levels of disturbance, but will also inform ongoing efforts to set science-based goals for reducing the amount of noise produced by large vessels.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5dc42a228072701763b3cba679fe674e"><name>east-antarctica</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New study shows retreat of East Antarctic Ice Sheet during previous warm periods</title><summary>Evidence of glacial retreat in the Wilkes Basin 400,000 years ago suggests ice loss in this region could add 10 to 13 feet (3 to 4 meters) to future global sea level rise.</summary><keywords>Terry Blackburn, Slawek Tulaczyk</keywords><start-date>1595430000000</start-date><display-name>New study shows retreat of East Antarctic Ice Sheet during previous warm periods</display-name><path>/2020/07/east-antarctica</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/07/east-antarctica</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1595006003715</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1595429913804</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/07/images/edwards-tulaczyk-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/07/images/edwards-tulaczyk-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>edwards-tulaczyk-450.jpg</name><display-name>edwards-tulaczyk-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>91825</file-size><width>450</width><height>318</height></image><image-alt>Researchers at Taylor Glacier</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/07/images/edwards-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/07/images/edwards-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>edwards-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>edwards-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17518</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Graham Edwards at Taylor Glacier</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UCSC researchers including graduate student Graham Edwards and Professor Slawek Tulaczyk, seen here in front of Taylor Glacier in Antarctica, investigated ice loss from the East Antarctic ice sheet during past interglacial warm periods.

For decades, scientists thought the East Antarctic Ice Sheet had remained stable for millions of years, but recent studies have begun to cast doubt on this idea. Now, researchers at UC Santa Cruz have reported new evidence of substantial ice loss from East Antarctica during an interglacial warm period about 400,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The study, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2484-5">published July 22 in <em>Nature</em></a>, focused on the Wilkes Basin, one of several bowl-like basins at the edges of the ice sheet that are considered vulnerable to melting because the ice rests on land that is below sea level. The Wilkes Basin currently holds enough ice to raise sea level by 3 to 4 meters (10 to 13 feet).</p>
<p>Ice flows slowly through the basins from the interior of the continent out to the floating ice shelves at the margins. Ice loss causes the grounding line&#8212;the point at which the ice loses contact with the ground and starts floating&#8212;to shift inland, explained first author Terrence Blackburn, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our data shows that the grounding line in the Wilkes Basin retreated 700 kilometers [435 miles] inland during one of the last really warm interglacials, when global temperatures were 1 to 2 degrees Celsius warmer than now,&#8221; Blackburn said. &#8220;That probably contributed 3 to 4 meters to global sea level rise, with Greenland and West Antarctica together contributing another 10 meters.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, a period of global warming comparable to what is expected under current scenarios for manmade greenhouse gas emissions resulted in an increase in sea level of around 13 meters (43 feet). Of course, this wouldn&#8217;t happen all at once&#8212;it takes time for that much ice to melt.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve opened the freezer door, but that block of ice is still cold and it&#8217;s not going anywhere in the short term,&#8221; Blackburn said. &#8220;To understand what will happen over longer time scales, we need to see what happened under comparable conditions in the past.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Novel technique</strong></p>
<p>The problem with studying the interglacial periods during the Pleistocene is that they all ended in another ice age when the ice sheet advanced again and covered up the evidence. For the new study, Blackburn and his colleagues used a novel technique based on isotope measurements in mineral deposits that record past changes in subglacial fluids.</p>
<p>Uranium-234 (U-234) is an isotope of uranium that accumulates very slowly in water that is in contact with rocks due to the high-energy decay of uranium-238. This happens everywhere, but in most places hydrological processes carry water away from sources of enrichment, and the U-234 gets diluted in large bodies of water. In Antarctica, however, water is trapped at the base of the ice sheet and moves very slowly as long as the ice is stable, allowing U-234 to build up to very high levels over long periods of time.</p>
<p>Blackburn explained that the ice sheet acts like an insulating blanket, so that heat from Earth&#8217;s interior causes melting at the base. But temperatures are colder where the ice is thinner at the margins of the ice sheet, causing subglacial water to refreeze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Water flowing beneath the ice starts refreezing at the edges, which concentrates all the dissolved minerals until it becomes supersaturated and the minerals precipitate out to form deposits of opal or calcite,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those deposits trap uranium-234, so we can date the deposits and measure their composition, and we can track that through time to get a deep history of the composition of water under the ice sheet.&#8221;</p>
<p>What that history suggests is that the U-234 in subglacial water in the Wilkes Basin was flushed out during the interglacial period 400,000 years ago as the ice melted and the grounding line retreated. That reset the U-234 concentration to low background levels, and accumulation then restarted when the ice advanced again.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Falls</strong></p>
<p>Blackburn noted that present-day evidence for the accumulation of U-234 in subglacial fluids can be found in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, the only place where Antarctic glaciers terminate on land. There, highly concentrated brines emerge from the glaciers in places such as Blood Falls, where the blood-red color comes from high iron concentrations in the brine.</p>
<p>&#8220;The isotopic compositions of those brines are comparable to the precipitates that we&#8217;ve dated from a range of locations, and they all share the characteristic U-234 enrichment,&#8221; Blackburn said. &#8220;The brines are what&#8217;s left when the subglacial fluids get all the way to the edge of the ice sheet.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the new study was inspired by a 2016 paper in which researchers studying deep-sea corals reported evidence of a major change in ocean chemistry, including a spike in U-234, coinciding with the end of the last ice age, when the vast Laurentide Ice Sheet that covered much of North America melted.</p>
<p>&#8220;They speculated that it accumulates under the ice sheets and pointed to some possible sites in Antarctica where that might be happening,&#8221; Blackburn said. &#8220;I happened to be in one of those places at the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>So was his colleague, glaciologist Slawek Tulaczyk, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz. They discussed the paper and began planning this study, which eventually involved several UCSC faculty and students. The team collected some samples of mineral deposits themselves, but some of the most important samples used in the study were collected in the 1980s and archived at the Byrd Polar Rock Repository at Ohio State University.</p>
<p>In addition to Blackburn and Tulaczyk, the coauthors of the paper include James Zachos, professor and chair of Earth and planetary sciences, graduate students Graham Edwards and Gavin Piccione, undergraduates Michael Scudder and James Babbe, and instrument specialist Brandon Cheney, as well as Bernard Hallet at the University of Washington and Noah McLean at the University of Kansas.

<p><span>But this year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it will instead be hosting a weeklong&#160;<a href="https://dickens.ucsc.edu/programs/virtual-universe/index.html"><strong><i>Virtual Dickens Universe</i></strong></a>, running from July 26&#8211;31.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The originally planned program on campus was set to focus on Dickens&#8217; <i>David Copperfield</i>&#160;plus&#160;<i>Iola Leroy: Or, Shadows Uplifted</i>&#160;by Francis E.W. Harper, one of the first African American women to be published in the United States.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>While that is now scheduled to take place in 2021, this summer&#8217;s week of virtual programming will offer a range of online panels and conversations that will provide context for those books, featuring&#160;scholars from Victorian studies and early African American studies. They will discuss links between the two fields, as well as approaches for addressing race and racism in the classroom, and ways to engage with Black studies in the 19th century.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Harper, a prolific poet and essayist, was also a prominent public speaker on issues of women&#8217;s rights and African American freedom during and after the American Civil War,&#8221; noted John Jordan, director and co-founder of the Dickens Project. &#8220;Her fourth novel, <i>Iola Leroy,</i> was published in 1892. Like many African American intellectuals of this period, Harper admired the novels of Dickens and saw him as a champion for disenfranchised and outcast members of society.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Like <i>David Copperfield</i>, <i>Iola Leroy</i> tells the story of a young person&#8217;s coming of age and struggle to survive during a time of social conflict and national unrest,&#8221; Jordan added. &#8220;Although they differ in many respects, both books are, in a sense, historical novels that trace the course of an individual life against a backdrop of social change and transformation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>J</span><span>ordan noted than an important evolution within the larger field of Victorian Studies in recent years has been its globalization and, in particular, its sharper focus on 19th</span><span><sup>.</sup></span><span>-century transatlantic relations, especially with respect to issues of slavery and its legacy in both Britain and North America.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;As part of this development, the Dickens Project had already begun to examine issues of race and race-centered pedagogy in sessions at our 2018 and 2019 summer conferences,&#8221; said Jordan. &#8220;The decision to pair <i>Copperfield</i> with an African American text was in this sense an extension of work already undertaken collectively by the Project faculty.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>He added that two other factors give the Virtual Dickens Universe of 2020 a special relevance and urgency.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The first is the growing prominence of the Black Lives Matter movement over the past few months in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and the subsequent widespread protests calling for an end to racial injustice in this country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160; </span>Among other things, the <i>Virtual Universe</i> will address the relevance of Critical Race Studies for students and scholars of Victorian literature, and of the humanities more generally, and will include a panel on practical strategies of anti-racist pedagogy in the classroom,&#8221; said Jordan<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;A second development is the publication earlier this month, in the <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>, of an important essay by three young scholars, all women of color, challenging the field of Victorian Studies to re-examine the racial assumptions underlying its self-definition as a discipline and calling on its members to devote more attention to issues of race&#8212;not only in texts by writers of color but also in all areas of Victorian literature and culture. Two of the authors of this major intervention (Ronjaunee Chatterjee and Alicia Mireles Christoff) will be among the participants in the Virtual Dickens Universe.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>And while there won&#8217;t be any Victorian teas, small group seminars or Victorian dancing this year (at least not in person), there will be a special event to culminate the <i>Virtual Universe</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>On Friday, July 31, high school students from South Los Angeles, who spent a large part of the 2019 school year studying <i>David Copperfield</i> and translating it into theatre, will present a dramatic online performance reflecting how their own lives relate to the novel. A Q&amp;A session will follow the production.</span></p>

He also received a 2020 Test-of-Time Award for a paper presented in 2001 at the International Conference on Embedded Software (EMSOFT).</p>
<p>The LICS Test-of-Time Award recognizes papers published in the LICS proceedings within the previous 20 years that have best met the "test of time" as shown by the influence they have had in the years since their publication.</p>
<p>De Alfaro&#8217;s research interests include game theory, system modeling and analysis, image processing, reputation systems, crowdsourcing, and machine learning. The LICS Test-of-Time Award recognizes a paper by de Alfaro and coauthor Thomas Henzinger from the 2000 LICS conference held in Santa Barbara. The paper, &#8220;Concurrent Omega-Regular Structure,&#8221; addressed a key issue for &#8220;concurrent games&#8221; used to model interactions between systems and their environments.</p>
<p>The LICS committee noted that the paper &#8220;studied the theoretical properties of the games and provided clever algorithms for computing the sets of winning states for three different qualitative modes of winning, reflecting different probabilistic guarantees. By settling several fundamental results of this theory, this is a landmark paper that has been extended to include further qualitative parameters (energy and other weighted games), richer winning conditions, and applications beyond traditional synthesis and control.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Alfaro and Henzinger gave an acceptance talk at the LICS 2020 conference, held online in early July.</p>
<p>The EMSOFT paper, &#8220;Interface Theories for Component-Based Design,&#8221; was also coauthored with Henzinger. The authors will be honored at the Embedded Systems Week virtual conference (<a href="http://esweek.hosting2.acm.org/">ESWEEK 2020</a>) in September 2020.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7d3da2668072701763b3cba63524de8a"><name>precautions-for-coyote-interactions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Take extra precautions with aggressive coyotes on campus</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department encourages people on campus or visiting campus to be extra aware of their surroundings after receiving several reports of coyotes acting aggressively or coming in proximity to people.</summary><start-date>1595487600000</start-date><display-name>Take extra precautions with aggressive coyotes on campus</display-name><path>/2020/07/precautions-for-coyote-interactions</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/07/precautions-for-coyote-interactions</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1595534058058</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1595534094174</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz Police Department encourages people on campus or visiting campus to be extra aware of their surroundings after receiving several reports of coyotes acting aggressively or coming in proximity to people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent reports have come from people at Family Student Housing, Rachel Carson College and Oakes College. In one incident, a campus resident was able to fend off a coyote attacking their small dog. The coyote followed them home.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The California Department of Fish and Wildlife offers </span><a href="https://wildlife.ca.gov/Keep-Me-Wild/Coyote" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">these suggestions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help prevent interactions between humans and coyotes:&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never feed or attempt to tame coyotes. The result may be deadly conflicts with pets or livestock, or serious injuries to small children.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not leave small children or pets outside unattended.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be aware that coyotes are more active in the spring, when feeding and protecting their young.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If followed by a coyote, make loud noises. If this fails, throw rocks in the animal&#8217;s direction.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a coyote attacks a person, immediately contact the nearest Department of Fish and Wildlife or law enforcement office.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to coyotes, UC Santa Cruz is home to mountain lions, snakes, bats, and more.

Music and Bookshop Santa Cruz to present </span><span><i>Celebrating Woman Suffrage and the Struggle for Voting Rights&#8212;</i></span><span>a live Zoom panel discussion followed by audience Q&amp;A&#8212;on Sunday, August 9, at 11 am.</span></p>
<p><span>In anticipation of the 100th anniversary of the passage of the19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote, and the upcoming November presidential election, it will explore the complex and controversial history of enfranchisement in the United States and its relevance to issues of equal rights today.</span></p>
<p><span>Moderated by Santa Cruz County Clerk/Registrar of Voters, <strong>Gail Pellerin</strong>, the panel will include UC Santa Cruz distinguished professor emerita of feminist studies, <strong>Bettina Aptheker</strong>; judge <strong>Marla Anderson</strong> from the Superior Court of California, Monterey County; and professor <strong>Aida Hurtado</strong>, chair of UC Santa Barbara&#8217;s Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The panel will be followed that evening by a live online Cabrillo Festival concert featuring the orchestral world premiere of <i>The Battle for the Ballot, </i>beginning<i> </i>at 5 p.m. A commissioned work by composer Stacy Garrop, it includes narration featuring the voices of black and white women who&#160;championed the struggle in the years leading up to the 1920 victory.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We are&#160;honoring the&#160;centenary of the winning of woman suffrage August 20, 1920, while at the same time honoring the long struggles of so many women to&#160;successfully exercise the right to vote&#8212;especially due to the&#160;systematic racist exclusion of Native American and Black women, women of Mexican heritage, and&#160;immigrant women,&#8221; said Aptheker. </span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;These exclusions gradually changed over generations and with the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965,&#8221; she added.&#160;&#8220;However, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013 by a 5-4 vote, and there are renewed legal and political challenges to voter suppression, particularly targeting people of color.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The fight against voter suppression</strong> has become particularly intense in the lead up to the Presidential election in November. Judge Marla Anderson will speak on the panel about the&#160;various laws that have been passed in state legislatures since the Supreme Court decision, including requiring voter ID&#8217;s,&#160;</span><span>gerrymandering, the purging of voting rolls, shrinkage in the number of polling places, shortening of hours for voting, and limits on&#160;early voting.<br/> </span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;All of these laws are intended to suppress the vote by Black, Latinx, Native American, and naturalized&#160;citizens,&#8221; said Aptheker. &#8220;Professor Aida Hurtado will particularly focus on the suppression of the Latinx vote, and on the ways in which&#160;citizenship and immigration intersect with voting rights.&#160;And Gail Pellerin, voter&#160;registrar in&#160;Santa Cruz county, will give factual&#160;information about voting in Santa Cruz.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Aptheker said she will spotlight the history of how a federal amendment for woman suffrage was won, paying particular attention to the ways in which lynching and terror against Black people in the South was a particularly potent weapon to intimidate any&#160;potential advances of civil rights and voting rights following the end of Reconstruction.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I will provide stories about the Black women who were part of the woman suffrage movement, like Ida. B. Wells-Barnett and Mary Church Terrell, specifically to counter this racial terror,&#8221; said Aptheker. I will show that woman suffrage and Black suffrage have been completely intertwined from the beginning of the struggle. And I will conclude with the heroic stories of the organizer Carrie Chapman Catt, who led the movement to victory in 1920; and the blazing courage of Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer, a sharecropper from&#160;Mississippi who helped to found the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party; and the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that finally extended the franchise to Black women and men in the South.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Aptheker added that she hoped that people wlll take away from the event an appreciation of the ways in which racial oppression and the denial of women&#8217;s rights have been and remain&#160;completely bound up with each other&#8212;on issues ranging from the suppression of voting rights to reproductive justice to immigration.&#160;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We also hope the panel&#160;will inspire folks to register to vote, help others to register,&#160;guarantee mail ballots throughout the country because of the pandemic, and&#160;encourage support for all candidates with a progressive or radical social justice platform,&#8221; said Aptheker.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;This is the moment of a monumental, pro-democracy movement in our country, led in the first instance by the Black&#160;women who launched the Black Lives Matter movement, and who have been voting in huge and decisive numbers, beginning in the South Carolina primary,&#8221; she added.</span></p>
<p><span>The annual international <a href="https://cabrillomusic.org/2020-season/rising-i/"><strong><i>Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music</i></strong></a> is usually held at the Santa&#160;Cruz Civic Auditorium each summer, but this year will take place online due to the pandemic from July 25 to August 9. The Voting Rights panel is part of the festival&#8217;s ongoing partnership with UCSC&#8217;s Humanities Institute (THI). This has lead to collaborative programming and festival events, such as the Ruth Bader Ginsburg tribute&#160;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/05/aptheker-justice-ginsburg.html"><strong><i>&#8220;My Own Words: The Law and Legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg&#8221;</i></strong></a>&#160;held in downtown Santa Cruz last year.</span></p>
<p><span>The THI-Cabrillo Festival collaboration additionally provides opportunities for public humanities research and work experience through the THI's <em><strong><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/12/humanities-public-fellows.html">Public Fellowship Program</a></strong></em>.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;THI is proud to be partnering with Cabrillo Festival once again,&#8221; noted managing director Irena Polic.&#160;&#8220;The panel on voting rights couldn&#8217;t be more timely, and we can&#8217;t wait for their virtual summer season to start. We've been impressed by the heroic efforts of the whole Cabrillo Festival team to keep the conversations and the music going, in times when we all need arts and humanities more than ever.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>"Cabrillo Festival has been grateful for THI&#8217;s partnership and support," added executive director Ellen Primack, &#8220;Our collaborations have elevated the level of educational programming we&#8217;re able to offer Festival audiences, and has expanded community outreach for us all. The programs we&#8217;ve developed together have been successful by every measure and profoundly rewarding.&#8221;</span></p>

Ms. Rose passed away in the evening hours of July 17, 2020.</p>
<p>Ms. Peggy, as she was affectionately and respectively called, was born in Yakima, Washington and came to UC Santa Cruz from CSU Stanislaus where she worked with transfer students. Peggy began her career at UCSC as an Early Academic Outreach Counselor, traveling across the northern parts of the state inspiring students of color that college was a viable pathway. Peggy saw an opportunity to impact students after they were admitted and began to serve as an Academic Counselor in Educational Opportunity Programs (EOP). The unique environment of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s college model provided opportunities to foster strong bonds between students, faculty and staff by living together. Peggy volunteered alongside colleagues like Lauren Reed and Liz Martin-Garcia, to serve as a Residential Preceptor. This role was a volunteer role staff members could take on to support students within the colleges to put on programs, resolve issues, and build connections within the campus community. In exchange for those aforementioned duties, the staff member and their family could live in a university apartment. Peggy served in this capacity in addition to her role as a counselor in EOP, liaising with Oakes College and Rachel Carson College (then known as College Eight), from 1999 to 2003. As with many things, Peggy went above and beyond, meeting with students, setting up multiple appointments, and cooking dinner for students.</p>
<p>After the program was no longer available, Peggy continued in her role within EOP and later became the Lead Academic Counselor and most recently was appointed as the EOP Associate Director. In these roles, Peggy provided supervision and mentorship to various counselors and student staff, managed office procedures, facilitated staff meetings, and coordinated the EOP professional staff &#8220;Boot Camp&#8221; training, to name a few things. The rigorous and comprehensive training served to prepare EOP Academic Counselors to understand the fundamentals of UCSC academic policies, common patterns of issues, the approach of case management and building rapport with students, creating plans of action, and ways to help students navigate, &#8220;The Navigator,&#8221; or the UCSC Catalog.</p>
<p>Peggy contributed to EOP with a fire and ingenuity centered on bettering student experiences and helping prepare them to be successful in the world after college. Peggy modernized and enhanced the EOP Bridge Academy, created the Improving My Academic Progress (IMAP) program, coordinated the Academic Excellence Reception (which became the EOP Faculty Dinner), set the foundation for our approach to teaching time management and study skills, helped to design and for a time co-supervised the inaugural African, Black, Caribbean (ABC) Retention Specialist, and influenced many other programs that are essential to our work within EOP and are understood across campus as best practices in supporting first-generation and low-income students.</p>
<p>She dedicated her life to supporting the success of all undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds and helping them to understand their fundamental rights as admitted students. She reminded students that, &#8220;You earned the right to be here and don&#8217;t let anyone tell you that you don&#8217;t.&#8221; She has impacted an innumerable amount of students, and their subsequent generations, in her work, but even after decades she would never forget a face and never wavered on her high expectations.</p>
<p>The community mourns her surprising and untimely loss. But we know that Peggy Rose is forever with us, in our hearts, our minds, and within the fabric of EOP. <br/><br/>Peggy is survived by her son, Bryce, her daughter, Ede Rose, and her granddaughter, Laila.&#160;<span>The family would appreciate the community's support in donating to the following:&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gf.me/u/yhm2gs&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1596042311712000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFh87c02fK77wkBen1XM6yJnNd2uA" href="https://gf.me/u/yhm2gs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://gf.me/u/yhm2gs</a>.&#160;<span>&#160;</span></p>

<p>The program targets middle school girls because that is an age at which many girls begin to lose interest and confidence in pursuing computing and technical subjects in school and as career options, said Isbister, who directs the <a href="https://setlab.soe.ucsc.edu/projects.php">Social Emotional Technology Lab</a> in the <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of it is due to social influences, because children at that age are very sensitive to what is acceptable to their peers,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Computer science has become a highly gendered domain, even though it didn&#8217;t start out that way, and a lot of girls just self-select themselves out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Studies have shown, however, that girls can become much more engaged when working on coding projects as part of a computational community and when the projects are socially relevant, Isbister said. The idea for the summer camp emerged from her team&#8217;s work on &#8216;social wearables,&#8217; wearable technology designed to support and enhance social interactions. The researchers have been working with groups engaged in live action role playing (LARPing), a popular type of fantasy game in which people create characters, make costumes, and act out various fictional scenarios.</p>
<p>&#8220;The LARP community is interesting because of their expertise in crafting social experiences and their attitudes toward technology&#8212;they will only adopt a technology if it enhances the shared experience of the group,&#8221; Isbister explained. &#8220;We thought this was relevant to the problem of getting girls interested in computing.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Edu-LARP</strong></p>
<p>The summer camp will use an educational LARP game as a sort of test bed for the development of social wearables by the participants, who will work together on designing and modifying wearable technology to support their social interactions in the game.</p>
<p>In designing the Social Wearables Edu-LARP (SWEL) camp, Isbister&#8217;s team at UC Santa Cruz will be working closely with the <a href="https://thegameacademy.org/">Game Academy</a>, which has years of experience offering classes and summer camps involving role-playing games. The Game Academy will also be running the camp sessions.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s advisers include Alexandria Leckliter, who oversees UCSC&#8217;s <a href="https://gie.soe.ucsc.edu/girls-engineering">Girls in Engineering</a> program as K-12 STEM outreach director for the <a href="https://epc.ucsc.edu/">Educational Partnership Center</a>. External evaluation of the camp&#8217;s effectiveness will be led by Jill Denner, senior research scientist at <a href="https://www.etr.org/">ETR</a>.</p>
<p>The first year of the project will focus on prototyping and testing, with the goal of running the first SWEL camp next summer. Isbister said she hopes that by then COVID-19 concerns will have abated, although the team is considering ways to adjust their plans if needed. &#8220;The good news is we can run it outside, but I&#8217;m hoping we&#8217;ll be at least somewhat out of the woods at that point,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Part of the plan for the project is to create a SWEL &#8220;camp in a box&#8221; that can be used broadly by schools and other organizations. The components used for the wearables will all be consumer-friendly hardware that is readily available online. The team will use an iterative approach to developing the camp and the camp-in-a-box kit, running trials with outside groups and working with the external evaluator.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our ultimate goal is to create a dynamic social and collaborative computational experience for the girls who attend these camps, which can have lasting impact on their future engagement with computation,&#8221; Isbister said.</p>

<p>The campus is testing 200-400 samples every week collected by Salud Para la Gente and Santa Cruz Community Health. UCSC is providing the tests on a cost recovery basis and Community Foundation Santa Cruz County will be paying for the cost of the tests.</p>
<p>&#8220;COVID-19 continues to affect our most chronically underserved and vulnerable populations nationally and locally. The Community Foundation is honored to partner with front line health care providers and UC Santa Cruz to ramp up testing for people at highest risk. Over the past four months, we continue to forge new partnerships that meet the needs of those most impacted by COVID-19.&#8221; said Susan True, CEO of the Community Foundation.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Molecular Diagnostic Lab received state approval for COVID-19 testing on May 1 and began running tests for Santa Cruz Community Health and the campus student health center. Researchers have been working to steadily increase testing capacity for Santa Cruz County to support efforts to detect the virus and reduce its spread.</p>
<p>With added capacity&#8212;the lab is now running 500 to 600 tests every week&#8212;the campus is ready to work with more local health care providers, said Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slowing and stopping the spread of COVID-19 requires that we all work together,&#8221; Kletzer said. &#8220;This partnership plays to the strengths of UC Santa Cruz, the Community Foundation, and our dedicated county health care providers.&#8221;</p>
<p>By working with local nonprofit health centers, the partnership will ensure that county residents will be able to get a COVID-19 test, regardless of their ability to pay.</p>
<p>Combined, the two nonprofit health centers provide care for about 39,000 Santa Cruz County residents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Public health data tells us the Pajaro Valley and the Latinx community are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19,&#8221; said Dori Rose Inda, chief executive officer for Salud Para La Gente. &#8220;Salud Para La Gente is committed to ensuring our patients and community have the best opportunity to be healthy during the pandemic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;COVID-19 testing is a vital part of that commitment and Santa Cruz Community Foundation and UCSC Molecular Diagnostic Lab&#8217;s partnership makes it possible to reach many with testing. This will support many more to remain safe, protect themselves and their loved ones, and return to work sooner and safer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the announcement of school closures on March 12, the Community Foundation started the COVID-19 Local Response Fund and has provided more than $2 million in local response grants and more than $5 million in donor advised grants for a total of over $7 million in COVID-19 relief funding.</p>
<p>Local nonprofit partners are immediately putting funds to work and 100 percent of gifts go directly to help residents of the county. In addition to relief funding, The Community Foundation has been working to support recovery efforts through funding the director of community recovery position for the SAVE Lives Santa Cruz County effort and leading the Economic Recovery Council with local business leaders and county public health officials.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="972d35398072701763b3cba643921b5b"><name>covid-recovery-forum</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus to host information forum on COVID-19 recovery, resiliency</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz will hold an information forum on COVID-19 recovery and resiliency planning efforts from 9:30–11 a.m. on Aug. 7.</summary><start-date>1595919600000</start-date><display-name>COVID-19 forum</display-name><path>/2020/07/covid-recovery-forum</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/07/covid-recovery-forum</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1595969189145</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1595969189145</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>UC Santa Cruz will hold an information forum on COVID-19 recovery and resiliency planning efforts from 9:30&#8211;11 a.m. on Aug. 7.</span></p>

<p><span>Established through the Sikh Foundation by Hardit and Harbhajan K. Singh in memory of their son, Sarbjit Singh Aurora, the chair supports research and teaching in Sikh and Punjabi studies at UCSC from a multicultural and global perspective.</span></p>
<p><span>Born in rural Punjab, Sahota grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and graduated with honors in history from UC Santa Cruz, receiving the Chancellor&#8217;s Award for his thesis on early Indian nationalism. He continued his studies at UC Berkeley, where he studied Sanskrit and Punjabi, and later entered the doctoral program in South Asian Languages and Civilizations at the University of Chicago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Before returning to teach at UCSC in the Literature Department, he also taught at the University of Minnesota, was a research fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Berlin, and a Fulbright Fellow in Delhi and London.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Sahota&#8217;s first book,&#160;<i>Late Colonial Sublime</i>,&#160;received the Mellon Foundation's Modern Language Initiative First Book Award. He is now working on a variety of writing and photography projects that intersect with the Sikh tradition and the literary languages of Punjab and the Punjabi diaspora.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Sahota described why he decided to take on the appointment as chair.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;In this moment of racial and ethnic self-reckoning in American society, I wanted to make sure UCSC can help open a new chapter in higher education that would forge a curriculum more in keeping with our times, more reflective of the needs of a multicultural California, and more deeply involved in questions of social justice such that new approaches, paradigms, critiques, histories, languages, and ways of seeing the world can be included in our institutions,&#8221; said Sahota.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The Aurora chair provides a platform for advocating for a stronger Asian humanities infrastructure at UCSC, while prefiguring what is possible through various curricula and scholarly activities at UCSC,&#8221; he added. &#8220;The position allows for a bridging of traditional South Asian studies (with its focus on classical Indian languages, literatures, religions, and arts), on the one hand, with critical race and ethnic studies (with its focus on social justice, diaspora, cultural difference, exile, and the politics of marginality).&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Sahota noted that his plans for the term as chair include a variety of events, programs, and public outreach projects&#8212;such as film screenings, conferences, photography projects to document the longstanding Sikh/Punjabi presence in California, and workshops to study key texts in the Sikh canon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>He will also teach at least one course per year on relevant topics and continue to make possible, for both undergraduates and graduate students, advanced research in Indian languages and literary traditions.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I hope the chair will afford me the opportunity to return to Punjab on occasion, to wander off the beaten track, make some forays into different archives, and maybe discover something captivating in the process,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Something of the sort seems to happen every time I am there!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Sahota&#8217;s appointment is for a five-year period from July 1, 2020, through June 30, 2025. Sahota will succeed UCSC professor Nirvikar Singh, who has served as the Sarbjit Singh Aurora Endowed Chair in Sikh and Punjabi Studies since 2010.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9ba1f5658072701763b3cba62c8f5cfc"><name>fidget-ball</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Toy or therapy device?

There&#8217;s no scientific evidence about whether they work, but that&#8217;s about to change, thanks for a new study by researchers at UC Santa Cruz and the UC Davis MIND Institute.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need science to weigh in on whether these devices can help, and how,&#8221; said Julie Schweitzer, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the UC Davis MIND Institute and the lead investigator on the project. &#8220;ADHD is associated with lower income, job instability, higher substance abuse and accident rates, and more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schweitzer said anxiety surrounding COVID-19 and working or attending school from home is a challenge, and the study has implications for how fidget devices might ease anxiety as well as increase focus.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are expected to be paying attention to virtual meetings for hours, and anything you can do to help improve people&#8217;s attention, alertness and emotional regulation could be helpful,&#8221; added Schweitzer.</p>

Participants will perform attention and memory tasks and be shown film clips to evoke an emotional response. The team will study natural physical movements, or fidgeting, in addition to giving some participants a specially designed &#8220;smart&#8221; fidget ball developed at UC Santa Cruz to squeeze, stroke, or tap.</p>
<p>The fidget ball&#8212;a silicon skeleton with a soft fabric cover&#8212;will measure each of those movements using internal sensors. The data are transmitted in real-time to a computer for analysis.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sensors measure not only when someone touches them, but how much pressure is used,&#8221; said co-investigator Katherine Isbister, a professor of computational media at UCSC&#8217;s Baskin School of Engineering whose team created the device.</p>
<p>The study participants will also be videotaped and hooked up to an electrocardiogram device. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be looking at whether there are physiological effects as well, such as changes in heart rate variability,&#8221; said Schweitzer. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be able to see when and how they use the ball, connect that with the physiology, and determine whether it&#8217;s working for them.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>AI analysis</strong></p>
<p>Another unique aspect of the study is its use of machine learning, an area of artificial intelligence, or AI, to analyze results. Using the data from the study, an AI program should be able to predict what fidget ball behaviors are effective and recommend fidgeting strategies as possible therapies. Co-investigator Daniel Shapiro, an adjunct professor of computational media at UC Santa Cruz, is developing the approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our end goal is really audacious,&#8221; said Schweitzer. &#8220;Eventually, we&#8217;d like to mass produce fidget devices that interact with a smart watch that would give the individual cues to let them know it was time to tap or squeeze the ball to help modulate their attention or emotions.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Previous research</strong></p>
<p>Schweitzer&#8217;s previous research showed that fidgeting, without a device, improved cognitive function in children with ADHD. &#8220;It&#8217;s a paradigm shift,&#8221; said Schweitzer. &#8220;My theory is that hyperactivity is actually an unconscious coping mechanism, so instead of trying to get adults and kids with ADHD to sit still, we can use this behavior to help people function better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now the goal is to see whether adding the fidget ball could be even more helpful, and perhaps less disruptive to others. &#8220;If we can help people by improving their attention and cognitive skills, as well as regulating their emotions, that would be pretty awesome,&#8221; she said.</p>
