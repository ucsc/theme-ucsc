Increasingly, however, attention has turned from these insoluble plaques to soluble forms of amyloid beta that can be taken up into neurons and are highly neurotoxic.</p>
<p>A new study by researchers at UC Santa Cruz pinpoints a segment of the amyloid beta protein that is recognized by receptors involved in neuronal uptake of this toxic peptide. The researchers used a novel approach to study the mechanisms of cellular uptake of amyloid beta. Their findings, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2009238117">published November 2 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>, suggest that targeting this process may be a promising approach for Alzheimer&#8217;s drug development.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many different ways that amyloid beta can be toxic inside cells, so wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if we could block its uptake by neurons? This is a pathway we can target,&#8221; said corresponding author Jevgenij Raskatov, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In the new study, Raskatov teamed up with co-corresponding author Glenn Millhauser, distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC, to study the interactions of amyloid beta with the cellular prion protein. Millhauser&#8217;s lab studies the structure and function of the prion protein, a membrane protein found on the surfaces of various cell types, including neurons in the brain.</p>
<p>Previous studies by other researchers have indicated that the normal cellular prion protein (not the abnormal variant that causes prion diseases) binds to clumps of amyloid beta and is involved in uptake and neurotoxicity. The UCSC researchers, led by graduate student Alejandro Foley and postdoctoral researcher Graham Roseman, sought to test whether the prion protein also acts as a receptor to take up soluble forms of amyloid beta, and to identify the site within amyloid beta that binds to this receptor.</p>
<p><strong>Mirror images</strong></p>
<p>The researchers took an approach based on previous work from Raskatov&#8217;s lab using mirror-image versions of amyloid beta to show that cellular uptake is mostly mediated by receptors on the cell surface. In the earlier work, researchers compared the uptake of natural amyloid beta with a synthetic version in which the arrangement of the atoms in the protein&#8217;s amino acids is a mirror image of the natural arrangement. This rearrangement subtly changes the protein&#8217;s structure in ways that would interfere with its binding to a receptor, so the finding that cellular uptake of the mirror-image version was greatly reduced pointed to receptor-mediated uptake.</p>
<p>Amyloid beta can be different lengths, but the most toxic variant is 42 amino acids long. To isolate the site involved in receptor binding, the researchers created a library of peptide segments of amyloid beta composed of, for example, just amino acids 1 through 16 or 1 through 30. For each segment, they made a version with natural amino acids (the &#8220;L stereoisomer&#8221;) and one with mirror-image amino acids (the &#8220;D stereoisomer&#8221;).</p>
<p>After testing all the peptides in the library for cellular uptake, they found that amino acids 1-30 showed the same stereoselectivity as full-length amyloid beta, with much greater uptake of the L form than the D form. In addition, this segment is completely soluble and does not form aggregates because it is missing a long hydrophobic domain involved in the aggregation of amyloid beta into clumps and fibrils.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this shortened amyloid beta, we are able to decouple cellular uptake from aggregation, giving us a great model for studying uptake,&#8221; Raskatov said.</p>
<p>By assessing amyloid beta uptake in cells with and without the prion protein, the researchers demonstrated for the first time the prion protein&#8217;s role in cellular uptake of soluble amyloid beta, consistent with its selectivity for the L stereoisomer of amyloid beta.</p>
<p>The non-aggregating amyloid beta segment 1-30 showed the same prion-dependent uptake and stereoselectivity. The researchers also used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to gather detailed information about the interactions involved in the binding of amyloid beta to the cellular prion protein.</p>
<p><strong>Oligomers</strong></p>
<p>Their findings show that the binding of amyloid beta at the cell surface, leading to its internalization, is largely due to the amino acid sequence 1-30 and not the state of aggregation. When amyloid beta molecules begin to aggregate, they form &#8220;oligomers&#8221; consisting of a small number of molecules stuck together that are still soluble and can be taken up by neurons. These soluble oligomers are increasingly considered to be the form of amyloid beta that triggers the pathological processes leading to Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, but there are many different aggregated forms.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are different levels of aggregation, different sizes and types of oligomers, and a big question has been which forms are internalized and cause neurotoxicity,&#8221; Raskatov said. &#8220;Our findings suggest that any form in which that sequence of amino acids is exposed will bind to the prion protein.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Millhauser, &#8220;The initial steps leading to Alzheimer&#8217;s disease may be the prion protein-mediated transport of soluble amyloid beta into neurons, where it then clumps, forming toxic aggregates that ultimately lead to the characteristic plaques associated with the disease.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the prion protein seems to be responsible for most of the amyloid beta uptake, the study suggests other receptors may offer alternate routes. Nevertheless, drugs that target the 1-30 segment of amyloid beta or the sites it binds to on receptors may hold therapeutic potential for treating Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our findings open up new avenues for understanding Alzheimer&#8217;s and suggest promising strategies for therapeutics,&#8221; Millhauser said.</p>

<div>On Tuesday, Americans will decide for themselves the direction they&#8217;d like to see our country head. Voting is a hard-fought right in the United States, and I urge all who are eligible to exercise it, either through mail-in balloting or by going to the polls. You have the power to shape our country&#8217;s future.<br/><br/>My hope is that we&#8217;ll have the national election results relatively quickly. My sense, however, is that with a record number of absentee and mail-in ballots already cast, declaring a winner in the presidential race may not be immediate. It&#8217;s possible we may not know who our next president will be for weeks. <br/><br/>Many in our community will undoubtedly want to come together Nov. 3 &#8212; even if only virtually &#8212; and in the days afterward to share experiences and raise their voices about this election. Coming together to declare shared values and find paths forward is important. As we all continue to navigate the COVID pandemic, the health and safety of our campus and broader communities must also be considered. Please continue to follow the recommendations of public health officials: practice physical distancing, wear a mask, and avoid large gatherings.<br/><br/>Free speech is both constitutionally protected and a fundamental value of our campus, and we have strong policies in place that protect it. We embrace our responsibility to sustain the free-speech rights of those who choose to exercise it. Every part of our mission as a university depends on the robust exchange of ideas. As campus citizens, though, it is also imperative that we embrace the responsibilities that accompany these rights. Our actions can show that it is possible to exercise your freedom of speech both passionately and safely. Learn more about free speech in our community and on our campus at UCSC&#8217;s new <a href="https://freespeech.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Freedom of Expression website</a>.<br/><br/>Whatever the outcome Nov. 3, we will remain steadfast in our community's commitment to pursue justice and social equity. Those values have been our ethos since our founding days, and we continually strive to more closely align our actions with our aspirations. <br/><br/><strong>Same-day voter registration</strong><br/>In the meantime, if you&#8217;re registered to vote and have yet to cast your ballot, take two minutes to double-check your registration online through <a href="https://voterstatus.sos.ca.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">California&#8217;s voter-status website</a>.

Hamilton as a low, quickly moving grass burn, sparing the reserve&#8217;s buildings and most of the oak trees.</p>
<p>But the August 20 blaze caused serious losses at a watershed research site established in the reserve by Margaret Zimmer, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz. An extensive array of hydrological instruments installed at the site by Zimmer&#8217;s Watershed Hydrology Lab in 2018 and 2019 was destroyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our entire field site burned, including the instrumentation we were using to track water movement and storage in the landscape,&#8221; Zimmer said. Lost equipment included streamflow gauges, groundwater wells, soil water sensors, and sap-flow sensors on trees.</p>
<p>Zimmer quickly realized, however, that the fire had created an unprecedented opportunity to study the impact of fire on a watershed immediately after it has burned. With funding from a Rapid Response Research grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF), her team is now working hard to rebuild and reinstall wells and instrumentation on the site, known as the Arbor Creek Experimental Watershed.</p>
<p>The focus of the new project is to understand how burned material, carbon, and nutrients move into streams and get flushed out of the watershed when the first rains fall on the burned landscape this winter.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a landscape burns, it produces charcoal and soot, called pyrogenic carbon, which behaves differently than unburned carbon,&#8221; Zimmer explained. &#8220;We want to know how it moves and where it goes. Fire also affects essential nutrients like nitrogen, so we want to see how nitrogen is exported from the watershed.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>First flush</strong></p>
<p>Previous studies have looked at watershed hydrology a year or two after a fire, but Zimmer said she&#8217;s not aware of any study that has been able to capture the first flush of nutrients and pyrogenic carbon from a fire-impacted landscape. Zimmer&#8217;s team will be able to capture this first flush in large part because the streams in this landscape are not perennial, meaning they are currently dry and will not carry streamflow until after it rains.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a unique opportunity with this field site, where we already have data from before the burn and can track what happens in the aftermath,&#8221; Zimmer said. &#8220;The immediate response is critical, because at this point it&#8217;s a completely charred landscape, and we want to know if the majority of the exported material gets flushed out by the first precipitation event, or during the first winter, or does it take longer. That has big implications for how ecosystems recover after a fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also has implications for water quality downstream from the burned landscape, she added. The site&#8217;s watersheds drain to drinking water resources used by about 2 million people in the San Jose region.</p>
<p>&#8220;Downstream water users want to know when to expect large amounts of sediments and nutrients washing down from burned areas,&#8221; said Zimmer, who collaborates with hydrologists at the Santa Clara Valley Water District.</p>
<p>The NSF grant enabled the team to acquire a powerful new instrument&#8212;a field-deployable spectrophotometer&#8212;which they can use to monitor suspended sediments and dissolved carbon and nitrogen in surface water and groundwater. A multi-source pump system will collect samples from up to 12 different locations at the confluence of two watersheds and deliver the samples to the spectrophotometer, providing measurements at regular intervals less than an hour apart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Historically, we would have to collect water samples and send them out to a lab, so with this system deployed in the field we can get much higher resolution data,&#8221; Zimmer said.</p>
<p>The team will still collect samples for laboratory analysis to calibrate and validate the sensor measurements. Zimmer&#8217;s collaborator on the project, Sasha Wagner of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, will lead the lab-based chemical analysis work. The project will support the research efforts of UCSC graduate students Lauren Giggy and Amanda Donaldson and technician Peter Willits.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Santa Cruz County Superior Court Judge Paul Burdick on Friday upheld UC&#8217;s detailed environmental review of Student Housing West. The project underwent a thorough analysis, underscoring the campus&#8217;s commitment to the environment.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The judge also determined that the project&#8217;s findings under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) were not properly adopted by the UC Board of Regents and on that basis has ordered the Board to set aside the project approval. The campus may return to the Board for approval of an on-campus housing project.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>"UC Santa Cruz values the input and feedback from the community regarding its projects, including housing. More campus housing is good for our students and good for our community," Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. "We look forward to returning to the Regents for their consideration and decision."</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>CEQA requires public agencies like UC Santa Cruz to inform decision makers and the public about the potential environmental impacts of its proposed projects and reduce those environmental impacts to the extent feasible.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>An environmental impact report (EIR) contains in-depth studies of potential impacts, measures to reduce or avoid those impacts, and an analysis of alternatives to the project. An EIR must be prepared and certified prior to project approval.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Student Housing West will provide new beds for our existing students and will help relieve pressure on local housing. The project will also provide a new childcare facility that will be able to extend service to the children of faculty and staff, in addition to students.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Before the pandemic, UC Santa Cruz was providing housing for more than 9,000 students. To support the health of the campus and the local community, the university is currently housing significantly fewer students and encouraging students to live at their permanent residence, if possible.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Parker&#8217;s poetry has been described as visceral, provocative, audacious and essential. Exploring issues of contemporary black womanhood, pop culture, and personal history, her poetry collections include <i>There Are More Beautiful Things Than Beyonc&#233; (2017)</i>, <i>Other People&#8217;s Comfort Keeps Me Up at Night (2015)</i>, and her latest, <i>Magical Negro (2019).</i></span></p>
<p><span>Praised as &#8220;</span><span>a riveting testimony to everyday blackness&#8221; by TIME magazine, </span><span><i>Magical Negro </i>was the winner of both a National Book Critics Circle Poetry Award and the California Book Award.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Parker&#8217;s poetry and essays have been published and anthologized in numerous publications, including the<i> Paris Review; The BreakBeat Poets: New American Poetry in the Age of Hip-Hop; Best American Poetry 2016; </i>the<i> New York Times;</i> and the<i> Nation</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>She is the recipient of a 2017 National Endowment for the Arts Literature Fellowship, winner of a 2016 Pushcart Prize, and has been hailed by<i> The</i> <i>New York Times</i> as &#8220;a dynamic craftsperson&#8221; of &#8220;considerable consequence to American poetry.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>A member of The Other Black Girl Collective, a Brooklyn-based black feminist duo with Angel Nafis, Parker is also the creator and host of the live talk show <i>Reparations, Live!</i> at the Ace Hotel in New York, and co-curator of the Poets with Attitude (PWA) reading series.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>She is additionally the author of the young adult novel, <i>Who Put This Song On?</i>, which is partly based on her own teenage life and diaries. And her debut book of nonfiction is forthcoming in 2022 from One World, a newly launched imprint of Random House.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Morton Marcus Memorial Poetry Reading</strong> is held each year to honor poet, teacher, film critic, and Santa Cruz cultural icon Morton Marcus (1936-2009). It was created to continue Marcus&#8217;s tradition of bringing acclaimed poets to Santa Cruz County, to acknowledge the significant role poetry has played in the community's history, and to help preserve poetry's influence in the county's culture.</span></p>

The record number of absentee and mail-in ballots cast means it&#8217;s possible we will not know the official election outcome for days.<br/><br/>I&#8217;m feeling anxious this morning, and I&#8217;m sure others are feeling the same. We must remain patient as the vote tally process unfolds. I believe that our democracy is sufficiently robust, and I am optimistic that the will of the people will prevail. It may simply take a while, and it is better to have an accurate count of all the ballots than a rapid result. <br/><br/>Many in our community will no doubt seek to come together today and in the days that follow to raise their voices about this election. Sharing experiences and finding common purpose are crucial to enacting change. As we continue to navigate the COVID pandemic, however, we must continue to consider the health and well-being of our campus and broader communities. Let&#8217;s all continue to follow the recommendations of public health officials by practicing physical distancing, wearing a mask, and avoiding large gatherings. We are entering a dangerous time in this pandemic, with cases and deaths spiking in communities nationwide. We must do our part to lessen its spread.<br/><br/>As I noted earlier this week, free speech is both constitutionally protected and a fundamental value of our campus, and we have strong policies in place to protect it. As campus citizens, it is also imperative that we embrace the responsibilities that accompany these rights. Our actions can show that it is possible to exercise freedom of speech both passionately and safely. Learn more about free speech in our community and on our campus at the new <a href="https://freespeech.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UCSC Free Speech website</a>.<br/><br/>I am grateful for our UC Santa Cruz community, where dedicated staff and faculty are coming together to support students and one another. This <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/11/election-resources.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">link</a> highlights some of the resources the campus is providing. Today, even more than yesterday, we must continue to find our voices, listen to different viewpoints, and identify ways to move forward together, united by our commitment to inclusivity, equality, and compassion.<br/><br/>Whatever the outcome of this election, know that this campus remains steadfast in its commitment to fairness, justice and social equity. These values are at the heart of what makes us a community. We will continue to strive to align more closely our actions with our aspirations.&#160;</div>

This annual award, presented by the journal <i>New Phytologist</i>, recognizes early-career researchers who are making outstanding contributions to the field.</p>
<p>Zhu said the win was both an honor and a bit of a surprise, since his approach to research differs notably from many past winners. Zhu specializes in applying advanced statistics and data science to help form a clearer picture of how ecosystems are responding to environmental change. As a passionate ecologist, he was thrilled to win an award named for Arthur Tansley, one of the founders of the field.</p>
<p>"Tansley is the scientist who first proposed the word ecosystem, which is really encouraging for me," Zhu said. "It's the concept of not just thinking about a narrow field of study, but taking a systems-level view."</p>
<p>Since Zhu joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 2017, his work has included calculating the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/07/zhu-forests.html">carbon sequestration</a> capacity of North American forests and studying how <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/03/zhu-fungi.html">soil fungal communities</a> may affect forest resilience. Zhu also received a major three-year <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/09/zhu-nsf.html">National Science Foundation grant</a> in 2019 to study the composition of soil fungi communities across North America.</p>
<p>His Tansley Medal win was based on the strength of his past scientific achievements, plus a <a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.16412">review paper</a> he submitted that was published in January. In that paper, Zhu synthesized both his own work and emerging research across the field to propose a new framework for integrating the study of forest regrowth processes with the effects of environmental change. Both factors have important implications for the future carbon sequestration potential of forests.</p>
<p>"I think it's time for us to integrate these two together and have a more inclusive view of how the forest might change in the future," Zhu explained.</p>
<p>As part of his Tansley Medal award, Zhu's work and personal story will be featured in a special editorial within a forthcoming issue of <i>New Phytologist</i></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9500e8018072701708c0293fb6e81def"><name>launchpad-fellowship</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Computer science grad student wins LaunchPad Fellowship for startup</title><summary>Fatemeh Mirzaei, a graduate student in computer science and engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering, is one of 40 student entrepreneurs selected for the Fall 2020 LaunchPad Fellowship program.</summary><keywords>Roberto Manduchi</keywords><start-date>1604563200000</start-date><display-name>Computer science grad student wins LaunchPad Fellowship for startup</display-name><path>/2020/11/launchpad-fellowship</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/11/launchpad-fellowship</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1604522665959</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1605110664197</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/11/images/fatemeh-mirzaei-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/11/images/fatemeh-mirzaei-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fatemeh-mirzaei-300.jpg</name><display-name>fatemeh-mirzaei-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>90948</file-size><width>300</width><height>374</height></image><image-alt>Fatemeh Mirzaei</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/11/images/fatemeh-mirzaei-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/11/images/fatemeh-mirzaei-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fatemeh-mirzaei-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>fatemeh-mirzaei-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17467</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Fatemeh Mirzaei</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Fatemeh Mirzaei</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Fatemeh Mirzaei, a graduate student in computer science and engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering, is one of 40 student entrepreneurs selected for the Fall 2020 <a href="https://www.blackstonelaunchpad.org/">LaunchPad Fellowship</a> program. The fellowship, offered by the Blackstone LaunchPad &amp; Techstars network, supports Mirzaei&#8217;s startup <a href="https://wiseper.com/home">Wiseper</a>, a decentralized fact-checking and exploration platform.</p>
<p>The LaunchPad Fellowship includes a $5,000 grant and 8 weeks of entrepreneurial resources, mentoring, and support. The fall 2020 cohort is focused on &#8220;social impact&#8221; student startups that seek a positive societal outcome.</p>
<p>Wiseper, which Mirzaei cofounded in 2019, aims to address the lack of reliable information regarding topics such as climate change, vaccines, health, and finance on social media, where 40 percent of people get their news. It is a social platform with an artificial intelligence component that enables users to collaboratively build context and resources around a topic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wiseper is a fact-first social network which is designed and optimized with emphasis on factual information, in contrast to existing social networks that have been optimized for engagement only and that are highly susceptible to misinformation,&#8221; Mirzaei said. &#8220;We want to provide greater context around online content for consumers, and reduce the amount of time people have to devote to sorting through information.&#8221;</p>
<p>The LaunchPad Fellowship program is structured around coaching sessions, weekly entrepreneurial workshops, and mentoring from Blackstone Campus Ambassadors and Techstars entrepreneurs and advisors. Students will also participate in a Techstars Mentor Week and attend the virtual LaunchPad Speaker Series.</p>
<p>Mirzaei said she and her co-founder, Amin Almassian, are excited about joining this program.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a great opportunity to connect to like-minded successful companies and entrepreneurs and learn from their success and failures,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Our hope is that this fellowship opens up more opportunities for Wiseper to grow its community and reach its capacity to serve millions of people to combat misinformation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the startup, Mirzaei is working toward her Ph.D. in the UCSC <a href="https://vision.soe.ucsc.edu/">Computer Vision Lab</a> led by Roberto Manduchi, professor of computer science and engineering. She is working with Manduchi on a project to develop a system that will make public transportation more accessible for people with visual impairments.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/humans-of-the-bsoe/fatemeh-mirzaei-graduate-student</url><title>Fatemeh Mirzaei Interview (BSOE)</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="953284ad8072701708c0293f9f90e461"><name>uc-continues-to-champion-diversity</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC to continue to champion diverse student body despite rejection of Prop. 16</title><summary>The University of California is disappointed that Proposition 16, the state ballot measure and constitutional amendment that would have repealed Proposition 209, did not pass in this election. </summary><start-date>1604520000000</start-date><display-name>UC to continue to champion diverse student body despite rejection of Prop. 16</display-name><path>/2020/11/uc-continues-to-champion-diversity</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/11/uc-continues-to-champion-diversity</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1604525917332</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1604525964789</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div class="yj6qo">The University of California is disappointed that Proposition 16, the state ballot measure and constitutional amendment that would have repealed Proposition 209, did not pass in this election. Proposition 16 would have helped reverse the detrimental and far-reaching initiative that banned the consideration of race, ethnicity and gender in admissions across public higher education, and other arenas, almost a quarter-century ago.<br/><br/>&#8220;UC remains steadfast in its commitment to attract and support a student body that reflects California&#8217;s dynamism and diversity, despite this setback,&#8221; said UC President Michael V. Drake, M.D. &#8220;We will continue our unwavering efforts to expand underrepresented groups&#8217; access to a UC education.&#8221;<br/><br/>The UC Board of Regents supported the passage of ACA 5, which became Proposition 16, a move that acknowledged the serious need to address systemic inequities in public higher education. By repealing Proposition 209, Proposition 16 would have ended the prohibition on granting preferential treatment to (or discriminating against) any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education or public contracting. The rejection of this ballot measure is an unfortunate continuation of the status quo.<br/><br/>&#8220;The University of California&#8217;s efforts to address racial inequities were greatly hindered by Proposition 209,&#8221; said UC Regents Chair John A. P&#233;rez. &#8220;The failure of Proposition 16 means barriers will remain in place to the detriment of many students, families and California at large. We will not accept inequality on our campuses and will continue addressing the inescapable effects of racial and gender inequity.&#8221; <br/><br/>UC has a longstanding commitment to enrolling a diverse student body, one that reflects California&#8217;s flourishing cultural, racial, geographic and socioeconomic heterogeneity. After the implementation of Proposition 209, the University saw a sharp decline in the admission and enrollment of students from historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. On every UC campus, the percentage of new California-resident, underrepresented freshmen decreased. While racial and ethnic diversity have improved in the past two decades, much of that growth is attributable to systemwide enrollment growth. UC still does not reflect the diversity of California&#8217;s population. Another negative impact: The percentage of students from underrepresented groups enrolled in UC&#8217;s outreach programs dropped from 90 percent before Proposition 209 to 75 percent thereafter. <br/><br/>Despite the failure of Proposition 16, the University will continue to look for innovative and creative approaches to further improve the diversity of its student body through outreach to underserved groups, schools and communities; support for college preparation; and efforts to close equity gaps among students attaining a UC education.<br/><br/>To uphold its commitment to diversity, UC will continue comprehensive review in admissions. The holistic method is used by most campuses and seeks to fully understand and evaluate each applicant through multiple dimensions. However, excluding race and gender from that consideration continues to be a tall barrier to women and students from underrepresented groups. UC will also explore opportunities to further encourage underrepresented groups to apply for and join UC&#8217;s outstanding student body. It will utilize and refine the many race-neutral alternatives developed following Proposition 209 for both outreach and admissions.</div></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz community</audience><admin>UC Office of the President</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="998f92658072701708c0293f58efcfc5"><name>cicek-muratcan</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Expanding the lines of communication</title><summary>Muratcan Cicek, a Ph.D. candidate in computer engineering who won a prestigious 2020 Google Ph.D. fellowship, is working to improve head-based pointing methods for those who cannot use a mouse or trackpad.</summary><start-date>1604563200000</start-date><display-name>Expanding the lines of communication</display-name><path>/2020/11/cicek-muratcan</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/11/cicek-muratcan</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1604599124552</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1604599124552</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/11/images/cicek-muratcan-portrait.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/11/images/cicek-muratcan-portrait.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cicek-muratcan-portrait.jpg</name><display-name>cicek-muratcan-portrait.jpg</display-name><file-size>44720</file-size><width>500</width><height>320</height></image><image-alt>Muratcan Cicek is a Ph.D. candidate in computer engineering at UC Santa Cruz and one of on</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/11/images/cicek-muratcan-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/11/images/cicek-muratcan-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cicek-muratcan-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cicek-muratcan-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>2518</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Muratcan Cicek is a Ph.D. candidate in computer engineering at UC Santa Cruz and one of on</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Muratcan&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cicek is a Ph.D. candidate in computer engineering at UC Santa Cruz and one of only 50 people from thousands of applicants to win a prestigious 2020 Google Ph.D. fellowship.</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Muratcan Cicek, a Ph.D. candidate in computer engineering who won a prestigious 2020 Google Ph.D. fellowship, is working to improve head-based pointing methods for those who cannot use a mouse or trackpad</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Muratcan Cicek&#8217;s mother tried to enroll him in first grade in their homeland of Turkey, she was told the school couldn&#8217;t accommodate her son, who was born with cerebral palsy and had a speech impediment.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took four years but thanks to his mother&#8217;s persistence, Cicek&#8217;s drive to learn, and a change in Turkish law, Cicek was eventually able to start school&#8212;although his father died of lung cancer before he could see it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the 27-year-old Cicek is a Ph.D. candidate in computer engineering at UC Santa Cruz and one of only 50 people from thousands of applicants to win a prestigious 2020 Google Ph.D. fellowship. His research focus is on machine learning applied to human-computer interaction, specifically working to improve head-based pointing methods for those who cannot use a mouse or trackpad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am really excited about it (the fellowship) because it will make things easier for my research,&#8221; Cicek said, speaking over a Zoom call using prototype software that is part of Project Euphonia, a Google research initiative that aims to improve computers&#8217; abilities to understand impaired speech. Fellow UC Santa Cruz electrical and computer engineering Ph.D. candidate Mustafa Mutlu, who is working on plasmonic nano-bio sensor development, also helped translate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Cicek, he was born in a rural part of Turkey but knew from a young age that if he wanted to reach his goals, he needed to move to a bigger city where there were more opportunities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how to get there?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I felt I had to work so hard,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taught how to read and do simple math by his mother, he finally joined his classmates for third grade and graduated first in his class in high school. He taught himself how to code and was awarded a scholarship to Ozyegin University in Istanbul after he won the top prize in a competition at a coding camp. He earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in computer science and later studied at Oregon State University. In 2017, he was admitted to UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Ph.D. program in computer engineering and joined Professor Roberto Manduchi&#8217;s Computer Vision Lab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There, he is working with Manduchi to improve computer head-based pointing (HBP) techniques. As it stands now, eye-gazing technology has a number of limitations, and while HBP is more popular among its users, too much light or a too-busy background can often blind the computer camera so the assistive technology doesn&#8217;t work. In addition, while a person can move their head in multiple directions&#8212;up-and-down, left-to-right, tilting side-to-side, forward-and-back, etc.&#8212;current technology only recognizes up-and-down and left-to-right movements. It isn&#8217;t natural or ergonomic, according to Manduchi. He and Cicek are researching ways to teach a machine to read varied head movements so the assistive technology is more innate and user friendly.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having someone like Cicek, who is a direct user of the technology, is important for their research, Manduchi said. Too often, a technological solution is discovered only to find out later that it didn&#8217;t fit an actual user&#8217;s needs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cicek, he said, is not only an excellent coder but &#8220;he&#8217;s got lots of energy and is extremely motivated.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This summer, Cicek also interned with Google as part of Project Euphonia, recording more than 2,000 phrases used to build a personalized speech-recognition model that can transcribe his words as he speaks. The idea behind the initiative is to help people with dysarthria (impaired speech) caused by stroke, traumatic brain injury, ALS, and other conditions to communicate more easily, according to a Google website.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while the prototype Cicek was using for the interview had a few bugs that required Mutlu to step in with a translation here and there, Cicek believes the program will help him communicate better in his career as a computer scientist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to companies like Google, he said, he will be able to continue his research to help more people communicate in improved ways.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="99bc457c8072701708c0293f60d2cf9c"><name>genome-alignments</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New genome alignment tool empowers large-scale studies of vertebrate evolution</title><summary>Important new studies of the evolution of birds and mammals relied on Progressive Cactus, a genome alignment tool developed at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute.</summary><keywords>Benedict Paten</keywords><start-date>1605110400000</start-date><display-name>New genome alignment tool empowers large-scale studies of vertebrate evolution</display-name><path>/2020/11/genome-alignments</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/11/genome-alignments</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1604602053978</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1605292124519</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/11/images/bird_collage-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/11/images/bird_collage-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bird_collage-410.jpg</name><display-name>bird_collage-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>114401</file-size><width>410</width><height>410</height></image><image-alt>images of birds</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/11/images/bird_collage-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/11/images/bird_collage-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bird_collage-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>bird_collage-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22496</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>images of birds</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Comparative genomics sheds new light on the diversity of birds and other vertebrates.

<p>Comparative genomics uses genomic data to study the evolutionary relationships among species and to identify DNA sequences with essential functions conserved across many species. This approach requires an alignment of the genome sequences so that corresponding positions in different genomes can be compared, but that becomes increasingly difficult as the number of genomes grows.</p>
<p>Researchers at the <a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a> developed a powerful new genome alignment method that has made the new studies possible, including the largest genome alignment ever achieved of more than 600 vertebrate genomes. The results provide a detailed view of how species are related to each other at the genetic level.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re literally lining up the DNA sequences to see the corresponding positions in each genome, so you can look at individual elements of the genome and see in great detail what has changed and what&#8217;s stayed the same over evolutionary time,&#8221; explained Benedict Paten, associate professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz and a corresponding author of two of the new papers.</p>
<p>Identifying DNA sequences that are conserved, remaining unchanged over millions of years of evolution, enables scientists to pinpoint elements of the genome that control important functions across a wide range of species. &#8220;It tells you something is important there&#8212;it hasn&#8217;t changed because it can&#8217;t&#8212;and now we can see that with higher resolution than ever before,&#8221; Paten explained.</p>
<p><strong>Reference bias</strong></p>
<p>The previous generation of alignment tools relied on comparing everything to a single reference genome, resulting in a problem called &#8220;reference bias.&#8221; Paten and coauthor Glenn Hickey originally developed a reference-free alignment program called Cactus, which was state-of-the-art at the time, but worked only on a small scale. UCSC graduate student Joel Armstrong (now at Google) then extended it to create a powerful new program called Progressive Cactus, which can work for hundreds and even thousands of genomes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most previous alignment methods were limited by reference bias, so if human is the reference, they could tell you a lot about the human genome&#8217;s relationship to the mouse genome, and a lot about the human genome&#8217;s relationship to the dog genome&#8212;but not very much about the mouse genome&#8217;s relationship to the dog genome,&#8221; Armstrong explained. &#8220;What we&#8217;ve done with Progressive Cactus is work out how to avoid the reference-bias limitation while remaining efficient enough and accurate enough to handle the massive scale of today&#8217;s genome sequencing projects.&#8221;</p>
<p>Armstrong is a lead author of all three papers, and first author of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2871-y">the paper that describes Progressive Cactus</a> and presents the results from an alignment of 605 genomes representing hundreds of millions of years of vertebrate evolution. This unprecedented alignment combines two smaller alignments, one for 242 placental mammals and another for 363 birds. The other two papers focus separately on the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2876-6">mammal</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2873-9">bird genome</a> alignments.</p>
<p><strong>International collaboration</strong></p>
<p>This international collaborative effort was coordinated by an organizing group led by coauthors Guojie Zhang at the University of Copenhagen and China National GeneBank, Elinor Karlsson at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, and Paten at UCSC. The genomic data used in these analyses were generated by two broad consortia: the <a href="https://b10k.genomics.cn/">10,000 Bird Genomes (B10K)</a> project for avian genomes and the Zoonomia project for mammalian genomes.</p>
<p>Scientists have been making plans for years to sequence and analyze the genomes of tens of thousands of animals. Coauthor David Haussler, director of the UCSC Genomics Institute, professor of biomolecular engineering, and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, helped initiate the <a href="https://genome10k.soe.ucsc.edu/">Genome 10K</a> project in 2009. Related efforts include the Vertebrate Genome Project and the Earth BioGenome Project, and all of these projects are now gathering steam.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are very much forward-looking papers, because the methods we&#8217;ve developed will scale to alignments of thousands of genomes,&#8221; Paten said. &#8220;As sequencing technology gets cheaper and faster, people are sequencing hundreds of new species, and this opens up new possibilities for understanding evolutionary relationships and the genetic underpinnings of biology. There is a colossal amount of information in these genomes.&#8221;</p>

The bottom planet, with less radiogenic heating, is geologically &#8220;dead,&#8221; with no volcanism.

<p>That&#8217;s because internal heating from the radioactive decay of the heavy elements thorium and uranium drives plate tectonics and may be necessary for the planet to generate a magnetic field. Earth&#8217;s magnetic field protects the planet from solar winds and cosmic rays.</p>
<p>Convection in Earth&#8217;s molten metallic core creates an internal dynamo (the &#8220;geodynamo&#8221;) that generates the planet&#8217;s magnetic field. Earth&#8217;s supply of radioactive elements provides more than enough internal heating to generate a persistent geodynamo, according to Francis Nimmo, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz and first author of a paper on the new findings, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abc251">published November 10 in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we realized was that different planets accumulate different amounts of these radioactive elements that ultimately power geological activity and the magnetic field,&#8221; Nimmo explained. &#8220;So we took a model of the Earth and dialed the amount of internal radiogenic heat production up and down to see what happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>What they found is that if the radiogenic heating is more than the Earth&#8217;s, the planet can&#8217;t permanently sustain a dynamo, as Earth has done. That happens because most of the thorium and uranium end up in the mantle, and too much heat in the mantle acts as an insulator, preventing the molten core from losing heat fast enough to generate the convective motions that produce the magnetic field.</p>
<p>With more radiogenic internal heating, the planet also has much more volcanic activity, which could produce frequent mass extinction events. On the other hand, too little radioactive heat results in no volcanism and a geologically &#8220;dead&#8221; planet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just by changing this one variable, you sweep through these different scenarios, from geologically dead to Earth-like to extremely volcanic without a dynamo,&#8221; Nimmo said, adding that these findings warrant more detailed studies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that we see the important implications of varying the amount of radiogenic heating, the simplified model that we used should be checked by more detailed calculations,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><strong>Habitability</strong></p>
<p>A planetary dynamo has been tied to habitability in several ways, according to Natalie Batalha, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics whose <a href="https://astrobiology.science.ucsc.edu/">Astrobiology Initiative</a> at UC Santa Cruz sparked the interdisciplinary collaboration that led to this paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has long been speculated that internal heating drives plate tectonics, which creates carbon cycling and geological activity like volcanism, which produces an atmosphere,&#8221; Batalha explained. &#8220;And the ability to retain an atmosphere is related to the magnetic field, which is also driven by internal heating.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coauthor Joel Primack, a professor emeritus of physics, explained that stellar winds, which are fast-moving flows of material ejected from stars, can steadily erode a planet&#8217;s atmosphere if it has no magnetic field.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lack of a magnetic field is apparently part of the reason, along with its lower gravity, why Mars has a very thin atmosphere,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It used to have a thicker atmosphere, and for a while it had surface water. Without the protection of a magnetic field, much more radiation gets through and the surface of the planet also becomes less habitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Primack noted that the heavy elements crucial to radiogenic heating are created during mergers of neutron stars, which are extremely rare events. The creation of these so-called r-process elements during neutron-star mergers has been a focus of research by coauthor Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would expect considerable variability in the amounts of these elements incorporated into stars and planets, because it depends on how close the matter that formed them was to where these rare events occurred in the galaxy,&#8221; Primack said.</p>
<p>Astronomers can use spectroscopy to measure the abundance of different elements in stars, and the compositions of planets are expected to be similar to those of the stars they orbit. The rare earth element europium, which is readily observed in stellar spectra, is created by the same process that makes the two longest-lived radioactive elements, thorium and uranium, so europium can be used as a tracer to study the variability of those elements in our galaxy&#8217;s stars and planets.</p>
<p><strong>Natural range</strong></p>
<p>Astronomers have obtained europium measurements for many stars in our galactic neighborhood. Nimmo was able use those measurements to establish a natural range of inputs to his models of radiogenic heating. The sun&#8217;s composition is in the middle of that range. According to Primack, many stars have half as much europium compared to magnesium as the sun, and many stars have up to two times more than the sun.</p>
<p>The importance and variability of radiogenic heating opens up many new questions for astrobiologists, Batalha said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a complex story, because both extremes have implications for habitability. You need enough radiogenic heating to sustain plate tectonics but not so much that you shut down the magnetic dynamo,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Ultimately, we&#8217;re looking for the most likely abodes of life. The abundance of uranium and thorium appear to be key factors, possibly even another dimension for defining a Goldilocks planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using europium measurements of their stars to identify planetary systems with different amounts of radiogenic elements, astronomers can start looking for differences between the planets in those systems, Nimmo said, especially once the James Webb Space Telescope is deployed. &#8220;The James Webb Space Telescope will be a powerful tool for the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In addition to Nimmo, Primack, and Ramirez-Ruiz, the coauthors of the paper include Sandra Faber, professor emerita of astronomy and astrophysics, and postdoctoral scholar Mohammadtaher Safarzadeh.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9a5a9e428072701708c0293f1149d1b6"><name>freezer-challenge</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Biology Teaching Labs wins honorable mention for Freezer Challenge  2020</title><summary>Julio Harvey, biology teaching laboratories manager in the Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology Department, has won an honorable mention in the 2020 Freezer Challenge.</summary><start-date>1604610000000</start-date><display-name>Freezer challenge</display-name><path>/2020/11/freezer-challenge</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/11/freezer-challenge</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1604612431396</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1604613801911</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>UC Santa Cruz Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Julio Harvey, biology teaching laboratories manager in the Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology Department, has won an honorable mention in the 2020 Freezer Challenge, a friendly competition meant to encourage researchers to use best practices in managing laboratory cold storage. <br/><br/>Harvey was one of three honorable mentions in the individual category among 88 research institutions and 218 labs that participated worldwide. UCSC&#8217;s Sustainability Office sponsored the Freezer Challenge on campus through its Green Labs Program.<br/><br/>The Freezer Challenge is a joint program run by My Green Lab and the International Institute for Sustainable Laboratories. Over the course of a year, labs receive points for taking sustainable actions related to their cold storage units, including actions that promote energy efficiency, sample accessibility, and sample integrity. <br/><br/>Winners are determined based on the number of points they earn as well as the amount of energy they saved. Participating labs and institutions for 2020 saved a combined &#126;3.2 million kWh/year, equivalent to reducing carbon emissions by 2,260 metric tons per year, or removing 360 passenger vehicles from the road for a year, according to the challenge.<br/><br/>Harvey was honored for his efforts to improve cold storage management and to reduce the environmental impact of the UC Santa Cruz Biology Teaching Labs which are an essential part of the curriculum for undergraduate STEM students.</p>

<p><span><a href="https://www.docnyc.net/film/for-the-love-of-rutland/">Limited tickets</a></span><span> are available to watch the film from Nov. 11-19, as part of the 11th edition of the <a href="https://www.docnyc.net/tickets-and-passes/">DOC NYC</a> film festival. Included with the ticket is an exclusive pre-recorded Q&amp;A with director/producer Taylor and guests, immediately following the film.</span></p>
<p><span>Taylor noted that this is an opportunity to view the film while it&#8217;s still on the festival circuit, as it is not yet in wide release.</span></p>
<p><span>Created in 2010,<i> DOC NYC</i> showcases new achievements in documentary film, along with panels and conversations. Normally based at the West Village&#8217;s IFC Center, Chelsea&#8217;s SVA Theater and Cinema, the festival has moved to a primarily online format for 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Described by the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> as &#8220;an essential summit for all kinds of documentary filmmaking,&#8221; the festival will screen over 300 films this year and host more than 100 special guests.</span></p>
<p><span>Past guests have included <strong>Martin Scorsese, Michael Moore, Jim Carrey, Susan Sarandon, Oliver Stone, Jonathan Franzen, Michel Gondry</strong>, and <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong>, as well as notable attendees such as <strong>Rosario Dawson, Fred Armisen, Jim Jarmusch, Michael Stipe, Katie Couric, Russell Simmons, Darren Aronofsky, Cornel West</strong>, and <strong>Naomi Watts</strong>.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/07/taylor-documentary-film.html"><strong><i>Taylor&#8217;s film</i></strong></a></span><span> is about Rutland, Vermont, a once prosperous American town that is now ravaged by drugs, poverty, and a diminishing population. When the mayor attempts to welcome 100 Syrian refugees, communal discord erupts over resources and civic priorities. Throughout all the noise, one woman stands apart, a single mom struggling with addiction and the demands of her family, who despite all her hardships, emerges as an unexpected town leader through her empathy for others.</span><span></span></p>

<p><span>Sponsored jointly by the AHA and the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University, the prize is awarded annually to honor and support work on an innovative and freely available new media project, and in particular "for work that reflects thoughtful, critical, and rigorous engagement with technology and the practice of history."</span></p>
<p><span>Sullivan&#8217;s project uses 3D technologies to enhance Geographic Information Systems (GIS)--one of the prevalent formats for data organization in modern archaeology&#8212;in order to create interactive models that can be navigated through space and time to explore the ancient Egyptian burial site of Saqqara.</span></p>
<p><span>Her publication is among the first to push the boundaries to include interactive 3D models that can be navigated both spatially and temporally. It was published earlier this year by Stanford University Press as part of their new series of monographs and scholarly publications.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>UCSC alumnus Vincent DiGirolamo</strong> also received the American Historical Association&#8217;s 2020 Palmegiano Prize in the History of Journalism for his book, <i>Crying the News: A History of America&#8217;s Newsboys</i>&#8212;which he started as a UCSC Master&#8217;s thesis in 1989. The book is an exploration of the newspaper industry and capitalism's exploitation of child workers.</span></p>
<p><span>DiGirolamo is now an associate professor of history at Baruch College of the City University of New York, where he specializes in 19th and 20th-century U.S. history, with a focus on workers, children, immigrants, city life, and print culture.</span></p>

Because his margin of victory over President Donald Trump is close, recounts have started in some states, while the courts are being asked to review the election process in selected areas. It&#8217;s unclear how long this will take, but we must continue to have faith in our democracy and display the patience that has served us so well this year.</span></p>

Approximately 160 million Americans voted, a record high for ballots cast in a presidential election and the highest voter turnout rate among eligible citizens since 1900. The wider, more representative the voter turnout, the better our democracy functions. I am grateful to all of you who participated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Survivors of the CZU August Lightning Complex fire have been sifting through the ashes, finding artifacts in the ruins of their lost homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now those objects are helping to unlock their stories of hope and grief as part of a unique visual and oral history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radio producer Nikki Silva of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Porter &#8216;73, aesthetic studies) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and award-winning Santa Cruz-based photojournalist Shmuel Thaler have teamed up with the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History (MAH) for an interactive project,</span><a href="https://www.santacruzmah.org/czu"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lost and Found: The CZU Lightning Complex Fire Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which collects stories of those who lost homes and businesses in the fires.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together with MAH staff, Silva and Thaler have asked participants to bring artifacts recovered from the blazes to their interview sessions. The results have been surprising and deeply moving for Silva, Thaler, and dozens of area residents who have come forward to talk about life after a devastating disaster.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Object lesson</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silva, a longtime Santa Cruz County resident, is half of the celebrated radio production team The Kitchen Sisters, along with Davia Nelson (Stevenson &#8216;75, politics). The duo is known for its broadcasts on NPR and other public media.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silva is an historian and curator who specializes in regional history. She has interviewed survivors of historic disasters, from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake to the 9/11 terror attacks.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAH put out a call for interview subjects to show up at the museum&#8217;s headquarters in downtown Santa Cruz for a socially distanced interview with Silva. (Silva and her subjects wear protective face masks during the sessions.)&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thaler&#8217;s photos and Silva&#8217;s interviews will reside in MAH&#8217;s historic collections for the use of historians and educators. They may also be part of a traveling exhibit.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Silva found that the recovered objects helped the subjects tell their stories.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It has been very moving, not just for us but for the people who have been telling the stories," she said. "It has been amazing to see the power of the objects they bring to the interviews. What does it mean when something emerges from the ashes? It takes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an extraordinary meaning. Why was this saved? Why is this object talking to me? What is my memory of it? How does it relate to the things I lost?&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each subject provides a different vantage point to the fire. One recent participant is a retired firefighter who helped battle the Lockheed Fire that swept through Swanton and Bonny Doon in the summer of 2009.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And he&#8217;s never seen anything like this,&#8217;&#8217; Silva said. &#8220;He was just astonished by it.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One person talked about her 16-year-old son, who had gone up with the express yearning to find this Boy Scout knife that his father had given to him,&#8221; Silva said. &#8220;That is all he wanted. And he found it, and the handle melted, but there you go. He had a vision of what he needed."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Cari Napoles (Porter, &#8216;91, American studies), senior director of development for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Humanities Division, came in for her interview, she held a pair of Japanese Shisa dog sculptures she bought on a trip to Okinawa as part of the</span><a href="https://okinawamemories.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Okinawa Memories Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a UC Santa Cruz public history project focusing on the U.S. military occupation of Okinawa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They have this incredible meaning behind them, these two little dogs that stand guard like little lion dogs," Napoles said. "People put them at their doorways and in front of their gates.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Napoles lost her home in Davenport during the fires.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Photographic memories</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thaler has been taking images of the found objects.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shmuel Thaler is an extremely beautiful photographer,&#8217;&#8217; Silva said. &#8220;These artifacts are like objects of art. They are totemic. They are not photographed &#8216;in situ&#8217;&#8212;at the site of the fires. They are photographed at the museum. When they are isolated in this way, they take on a different meaning.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 has added logistical challenges to the interviews.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Usually when I am interviewing someone, I am right in their face, and sitting really close,&#8217;&#8217; Silva said. &#8220;We can&#8217;t do that. I have a six-foot boom pole and we&#8217;re all wearing masks and have a table between us in the big atrium of the museum. Everything is sanitized, and we change the microphone&#8217;s windscreen between interviewees, so we&#8217;re being very careful.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering the painful subject matter and the need for precautions during a time of pandemic fears, Silva wasn&#8217;t sure who would show up and what to expect.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s difficult for people to talk about something so intensely personal and terrifying,&#8221; Silva said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know if people would want to come or what it would be like if they did come.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But it&#8217;s been very moving, not just&#160; for us but for the people who come here to share their stories with us. Everyone has said how important it has been just to talk about it. It&#8217;s like all of us when anything horrible or traumatic happens. You just have to tell the story over and over. It settles in you, and you can figure it out. And using objects is an amazing way to do it. It brings back memories and associations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>The power of voice</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the talks with Silva are much more than therapy sessions. They are vividly detailed and evocative accountings of a fire and its aftermath, going far beyond newspaper clippings and statistics.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;From the standpoint of the historical record, this project is so valuable,&#8221; Silva said. &#8220;So much of the time, we have something one person wrote, or one person filmed, from just one vantage point. But this project gives us so many perspectives on the fire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been doing audio storytelling for years,&#8217;&#8217; she said. &#8220;And there&#8217;s something about the voice that is not like the written word. There are other depths, beneath the words, and it all comes through for me&#8212;the informational, the descriptive, the emotional. There are just so many layers.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silva and Thaler have scheduled another interview session for November 11 and 14 at the MAH. Participants may sign up for one-hour sessions using safety measures.</span><a href="https://www.santacruzmah.org/czu"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For more information, visit the project&#8217;s web page.&#160;</span></a></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The campus has been through a lot this year: strikes, COVID-19, fire evacuations, and other momentous events both internal and external that have had an effect on our work. How we support you and the role that technology plays in your work are more important than ever.&#160;</span><strong id="m_-733911220366988340gmail-docs-internal-guid-a3f7fb35-7fff-99f0-f2f7-fd0fa7d4a302"></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We have seen unprecedented demand for services as campus needs changed and strategic objectives rapidly evolved. For example, did you know that UCSC held over 100,000 Zoom meetings in the month of May? That was up from just over 3,000 meetings per month one year earlier. And, that staggering number, with all of the support implications that it entails, will likely grow in 2021.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Below are some changes in IT services that are worth reviewing, some notable improvements, and a glance at coming attractions for the year ahead.&#160;</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>What We&#8217;ve Been Up To</span></h2>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Transforming Technology During a Pandemic</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Campus priorities dramatically changed on March 16 when the mandated shelter-in-place order took effect, and our county took extraordinary steps to respond to COVID-19. We immediately augmented support and quickly rolled out some key new services to smooth the transition for campus. Our efforts emphasized helping:&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Students to learn remotely</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Faculty to successfully engage in remote instruction and continue their critical research</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Staff to get set up to work productively from remote locations&#160;</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The surge in people learning/teaching/working remotely also required the Information Security team to address a sudden increase in phishing/social engineering security threats, which unfortunately continues to this day. Last month we took steps to inform students, faculty, and staff about these threats as part of the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://its.ucsc.edu/security/ncsam.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1605045001789000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3e3Xk9O7kyu2xmMkJl-tOU" href="https://its.ucsc.edu/security/ncsam.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>National Cybersecurity Awareness Month</span></a><span> campaign. </span><span><br/></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Helping Campus Respond to the CZU Lightning Complex Fire&#160;</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the days leading up to the order to evacuate, we took necessary steps to </span><span>rescue important research and administrative backups so that campus data was secure, </span><span>shut down key campus infrastructure, and made sure the campus Police Dispatch had an alternate, safe location so their important work could continue. Like many of you, we did our best to step up and fill in wherever we could to provide as much service and support as possible while preparing for the very real possibility of property loss both at work and at home. I witnessed an outpouring of empathy combined with acts of generosity and moments of true heroism throughout campus that transcended standard professional protocol. I am so proud of the resiliency that staff in ITS demonstrated.&#160;</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span>Personalized Instructional Support</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>UCSC student workers were assigned to help faculty one-on-one in the use of Zoom during their online remote courses. The student workers involved were themselves remote and were unsure of how their campus jobs would be affected by the shelter-in-place order. But, they still needed the hours and the pay to allow them to make ends meet and continue their studies. </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://its.ucsc.edu/news/student-corps.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1605045001789000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0F6JS_0XGwCIcTE66-aHjl" href="https://its.ucsc.edu/news/student-corps.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Read full article</span></a></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span>Easier Access to Video Content</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Faculty and students can now create and manage instructional videos using YuJa, which was deployed and integrated with Zoom and Canvas. Video-based content produced by faculty and students (or even staff) can be stored and captioned securely while the integration with Zoom makes recorded meetings/classes available in the same familiar platform. Growth of video-based content resulting from the push to remote instruction (and work) has been enormous, and UCSC is now prepared. </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://its.ucsc.edu/yuja/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1605045001789000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ie8ZVu0NWyW3QoMUGH36l" href="https://its.ucsc.edu/yuja/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>More details</span></a></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span>Moving from Paper to Digital Grading</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Gradescope, a product that streamlines the grading process was fully integrated with Canvas. Gradescope helps faculty and graduate TAs get through grading faster, thereby freeing up time for them to work on their research and other projects or service activities. </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://its.ucsc.edu/gradescope/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1605045001789000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ZDpQZm-zL2KUhGGok7LSW" href="https://its.ucsc.edu/gradescope/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>More details</span></a></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span>Moving from Paper to Digital Forms</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>DocuSign, a product that allows people to digitally sign documents securely, was deployed in late 2019 before the Coronavirus changed how the campus conducted business. Since its rollout academic and administrative departments have been reinventing their business processes on the fly and streamlining their workflows. The improved security and the elimination of the need for wet signatures was timely and ultimately reduced the disruptions caused by the shelter-in-place order. </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://its.ucsc.edu/docusign/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1605045001789000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3hWlxzSbPQhONw_eV8dOF9" href="https://its.ucsc.edu/docusign/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>More details</span></a></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Coronavirus Testing in UCSC&#8217;s Molecular Diagnostic Lab</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In August, through a partnership with the county, the Molecular Diagnostic Lab testing facilities on campus acquired new equipment to expand their capabilities. We worked with campus support providers to keep the technology and systems in the testing lab functional, online, and HIPAA compliant. Staff can now test hundreds of samples per day, which is critical to safely reopening the campus and keeping the broader Santa Cruz community safe.&#160;</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Securing Remote Access</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Since the campus now conducts business from all types of remote locations, we have observed a significant increase in people using the Virtual Private Network (VPN). In July, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), also known as &#8220;two-step&#8221; or &#8220;two-factor&#8221; authentication, was added to the VPN authentication process to provide an extra layer of security and make our campus operations safer from wherever people connect.&#160;</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Expanding Computational Research</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>UCSC&#8217;s computational research capabilities expanded in two ways: First, thanks to the leadership of Professor Brant Robertson, a new high performance computing (HPC) environment was deployed that enables climate modeling, astrophysical simulations, and machine learning. </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/10/lux-supercomputer.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1605045001790000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3P3qZXd2F9kR8VW2mEx6kn" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/10/lux-supercomputer.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>More details</span></a><span> We also stabilized and expanded access to the Hummingbird environment, allowing more people to use it for their remote research. </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.hb.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1605045001790000&amp;usg=AOvVaw31-MonkXoEQoRlwVlVl-SL" href="https://www.hb.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>More details</span></a></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Making Website Management Easier</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Resulting from a decision to adopt Drupal as a common web content management platform for the campus in 2019, Chancellor Larive and CPEVC Kletzer charged ITS and University Relations (UR) with creating a centrally managed Drupal instance that 1) uses a shared design system, 2) enables content reuse, 3) supports a content governance model, and 4) is scalable to support the campus web presence. Work in ITS and UR began in earnest with input from a campuswide Digital Marketing &amp; Communication Council to move this massive, multi-year initiative forward.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Streamlining HR Processes</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Over the past year, we have been hard at work deploying many new systems and feature upgrades to existing systems that directly benefit students, faculty, and staff who want to move through our online processes smoothly and with the least amount of headache possible. In partnership with Staff Human Resources, two notable rollouts were: The new ePerformance tool and the Talent Acquisition Module (TAM) that replaced the aging RMS system. Faculty and staff can access both of these systems via UCPath.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Although there is a learning curve involved, these state-of-the-art systems reduce the time it takes to move through important processes and allow business units to effectively manage and store mission critical information. Specifically, the ePerformance system makes collaboration on performance evaluations easier while the Talent Acquisition Module provides a modern and simplified interface for prospective job applicants.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Paying Tuition with a Credit Card</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>UCSC students now have the ability to conduct financial transactions (including tuition payment and refunds) using a credit card in the financial online system. Partnering with Student Business Systems, we updated multiple interfaces and engaged in the technical work necessary so that students can accomplish more via self-service.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Where We&#8217;re Heading 2020-21</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the coming year, we will continue to prioritize support for remote instruction, IT security, and support for research initiatives, particularly those related to COVID-19 testing. We will continue to improve communications with campus on the services we offer, the decisions made with your input, and the service implications for the technical changes that lay ahead. To that end, here are three important projects to be aware of in the coming year:</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Simplifying Student Recruitments</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A new workgroup has formed, under the direction of the Division of Student Affairs and Success, to replace the existing Student Recruitment system. Partners in this effort currently include the Career Center, Staff HR, Undergraduate Education (including Academic HR and Financial Aid) and ITS.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Managing Spaces Efficiently and Safely</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We will be replacing the systems that maintain campus space and facilities with a new system that provides a&#160; more modern mobile interface. As we adjust to life with COVID, this new system will help ensure that the campus offers clean and safe spaces for our students, faculty, and staff.</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Improving our Campus Website Experience</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Through a partnership with ITS and University Relations, the campus will begin rolling out a unified website design this year. The new design will establish a common look and feel while preserving while preserving the distinctiveness and uniqueness of each department&#8217;s website.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It has been an exceedingly productive year and we&#8217;re excited about what&#8217;s coming next, like improvements to student housing services, cross-campus enrollment, the rollout of a new Student Experience with Teaching survey system, and improvements to the dining experience for students.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this fall looks quite different due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced a pivot toward online operations almost eight months ago.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With only six in-person classes being offered this quarter and less than 15% of on-campus housing available to students&#8212;with priority given to students who do not have alternative housing options&#8212;campus is eerily quiet these days.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s newest freshman and transfer students are learning to be adaptable and creative, finding new ways to build a strong sense of community while living and learning remotely.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Although I had to start my university experience fully online, I&#8217;m trying my best to develop and maintain community in the virtual world by attending career webinars, joining campus organizations, and forming study groups with my classmates,&#8221; said transfer student Muhammad Khan (Kresge &#8216;22, accounting).</span></p>
<p><strong><i>New experiences</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New transfer student and Santa Cruz native Juliana Hale (Kresge &#8216;22, molecular, cell, and developmental biology) was looking forward to exploring the heavily wooded, 2,000-acre campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her first quarter, Hale, who only lives a short bike ride away from campus, was hoping to network with faculty in person, begin hands-on research opportunities, potentially join the track team, and form in-person study groups with her classmates.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Hale waits patiently for her highly anticipated on-campus experience, she is adapting to a virtual learning environment with a self-paced schedule and an at-home work and study space that keeps her focused and grounded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A couple of my classes have pre-recorded lectures, which gives me the ability to pause, rewind, and take better notes to fully comprehend the material,&#8221; said Hale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a few weeks into the fall quarter, Hale had already established a virtual support network through participation in two different STEM programs and the Academic Excellence Program (ACE). These programs have provided a much-needed support system while she navigates university life online.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Silver linings</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freshman Elliott Harrington (Rachel Carson &#8216;24, molecular, cell, and developmental biology) was able to make the transition to a fully online schooling experience without any difficulty.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Personally, having an independent learning style has made the online component of school much easier for me, and being able to maintain a daily routine while remote allows me to stay productive,&#8221; stated Harrington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Harrington was looking forward to meeting new people in person, he&#8217;s been able to meet and connect with his peers in online classes, including some of his fellow Southern Californians.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My professors have been doing an excellent job of familiarizing students with their classmates through breakout sessions to help build connections,&#8221; Harrington said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even through all the adversity this year has brought, new Slugs have still been able to identify the upside of remote learning.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I noticed that there are many resources available when studying remotely that you might not always have or at least have the time to tap into when studying in person,&#8221; Khan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khan credits the UCSC social media pages, his major department, and his college for keeping him connected to the campus community and informed on important events and news while in the virtual world.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Looking forward</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the new group of Slugs has yet to experience on-campus life, and it remains unclear when as a campus we will be able to return to normal operations, the need for community is greater than ever.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many students, the encouragement of loved ones, and knowing what to expect from this unusual year, helped ease them into a challenging situation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Having family support during the emotional shock of quarantine, and learning that school was going to be online indefinitely, was critical to helping me keep mentally healthy and moving forward,&#8221; said transfer student Dmitrius Rodriguez (Merrill &#8216;22, environmental studies and economics) who remains at his family&#8217;s home in the Bay Area.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he&#8217;s thriving in this new, remote-learning format, Rodriguez looks forward to &#8220;making genuine connections with people across campus, doing undergraduate research, and being able to explore the vast redwood forests that run through campus.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For transfer students&#8212;especially&#8212;the window of time that they have to experience UC Santa Cruz in person is minimal. So Khan, for his part, is going to make the most out of every moment he has on campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If I&#8217;m not able to get to campus until let&#8217;s say next fall, then you better believe I am going to make sure I fit four years of university experience into one,&#8221; he said. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b32a938e8072701708c0293f2d942dac"><name>telecommuting-roundtable</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus to host telecommuting roundtable on Nov. 20</title><summary>Topics will include ergonomics, wellness and safety, technology and cybersecurity, accommodations, and leading hybrid and remote teams.&#13;

<p>Recommender systems are among the most familiar practical applications of artificial intelligence (AI), suggesting music and movies people might like and products they might want to buy. Recommender dialogues, also known as conversational recommender systems, aim to go a step beyond and engage the user in an interactive dialogue to elicit more details about the user&#8217;s current interests and deliver more useful recommendations. But existing dialogue agents have limited capabilities.</p>
<p>Getoor and her collaborators bring a mix of backgrounds and expertise to the project. William Wang, director of UCSB's Natural Language Processing group and Center for Responsible Machine Learning, has broad interests in machine learning approaches to data science, including natural language processing and knowledge representation. Jay Pujara is a research assistant professor of computer science at USC whose research in artificial intelligence emphasizes user utility. He did postdoctoral research with Getoor at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;We form a strong tripod to support this project in terms of our backgrounds,&#8221; Getoor said. &#8220;We will also be working with leading experts at Google in machine learning, natural language processing, and knowledge-based reasoning.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s approach will be based on Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL), an open-source toolkit developed by Getoor&#8217;s group at UC Santa Cruz that has been applied to a wide range of machine learning problems. PSL is a highly scalable probabilistic programming framework that is able to reason both statistically, using similarities, and logically, using soft rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;PSL is different from deep learning because of the way you can express soft tendencies, such as rules that apply most of the time but not all of the time, so it&#8217;s very intuitive and its results are easier to interpret,&#8221; Getoor said.</p>
<p>The researchers plan to extend PSL in key ways to integrate it with neural network-based deep learning approaches, which are highly popular but have some significant limitations. &#8220;The core of the project is figuring out how to integrate these approaches. What that will enable is a more informed dialogue that takes into account more of the user&#8217;s context,&#8221; Getoor said.</p>
<p>Wang added that the project aims to improve the reasoning capabilities of dialogue agents, so that the system can better understand a user&#8217;s request, using context and other information to generate a more appropriate response.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, if I say I just had Italian for lunch, can you recommend a restaurant for dinner, a lot of dialogue systems don&#8217;t understand semantic constraints, so it might recommend a pizza place because of the implicit connection between pizza and Italian food,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;That&#8217;s an issue that is often frustrating for users.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team will explore a unified reasoning and discovery framework to design better algorithms and models for understanding the roles of context, knowledge, and uncertainty in dialogues. In particular, the team will investigate natural language understanding, knowledge discovery and reasoning, and natural language generation in task-oriented dialogues and beyond.</p>
<p>Google supports innovative research projects in areas of study that are of key interest to Google as well as the research community. Getoor received a Google Faculty Research Award in 2019, and the new project builds on the work supported by that earlier grant.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bd8e50a28072701708c0293f8115d161"><name>fish-free-feed</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Research breakthrough achieves fish-free aquaculture feed that raises key standards</title><summary>A new aquaculture feed formula eliminates conventional fish meal and fish oil ingredients by combining ingredients derived from two species of marine microalgae.&#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a potential game-changer for shifting aquaculture to more sustainable practices,&#8221; said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pallab Sarker</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, lead author of a </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75289-x"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientific Reports </span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">article on this research published Nov. 12. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarker, an associate research professor in environmental studies, works alongside Professor </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anne Kapuscinski</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a sustainability science and policy expert, to co-lead an ecological aquaculture research facility at the UCSC Farm. Their lab focuses on integrating circular economy concepts into aquatic food systems, particularly as a means of breaking aquaculture&#8217;s reliance on wild-caught forage fish for feed ingredients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarker and Kapuscinski developed their new feed by replacing fish oil with whole cells from a marine microalga called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schizochytrium </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sp.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and swapping out fish meal for</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">leftover biomass from</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">oil-extracted marine </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nannochloropsis oculata</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> microalga, a protein-rich waste product from commercial omega-3 dietary supplement production.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new fish-free feed formula was then tested against a conventional feed and a few other blends in an experiment where 480 Nile tilapia were cultivated for six months. By the end of the trial, tilapia on the fish-free diet showed 58 percent higher weight gain percentages, compared to those on conventional feed. Tilapia on the fish-free diet also had the highest amount of heart-healthy DHA omega-3 fatty acids in their filets, which is a key improvement over other feed formulations currently available on the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You can develop fish-free feed using soy and corn and other ingredients, but the problem is, you compromise the fatty acid profile of the filet,&#8221; Sarker explained. &#8220;Terrestrial vegetable oils lack long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, but from the combination of these microalgae, we found a higher amount of deposition from DHA into tilapia filets, which is good for human health.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feed produced using agricultural crops can also have an imbalance of limiting amino acids and lower palatability and digestibility, resulting in reduced fish growth. That's part of why feed redevelopment efforts over the years have been looking for ways to use less terrestrial crops and more microalgea in their formulas. Microalgae-based formulas also reduce the myriad sustainability issues associated with producing agricultural products for animal feed, rather than direct human consumption. And the team&#8217;s research shows promising results for the potential cost-competitiveness of their new formula, too.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite some of the ingredients in the fish-free feed being slightly more expensive compared to conventional feed, the tilapia on the fish-free diet grew so efficiently that the estimated production cost per kilogram of tilapia was actually lower for the new formula.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That outcome, in particular, is likely to pique interest across the aquaculture industry, since tilapia is one of the most popular farmed fish in the world. The insights from this successful feed formula may have applications for other species, too. Sarker and Kapuscinski now hope to leverage what they&#8217;ve learned to develop new and improved fish-free aquaculture feed formulas for </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/03/sarker-grant.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rainbow trout</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If successful, those efforts would be another major milestone, since salmonids are highly valued in aquaculture and consume enormous quantities of fish meal and fish oil. Aquaculture will need to continue expanding to support the protein demands of a growing human population, but through continued research, UC Santa Cruz scientists see an opportunity to help shape a more sustainable future in that process.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector in the world, but it&#8217;s still a young industry compared to agriculture,&#8221; Sarker said. &#8220;We have an opportunity to not make the same mistakes. This research could be a key leverage point for reforming aquaculture to ensure sustainable growth in ways that don&#8217;t damage terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems.&#8221; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="beef403b8072701708c0293f50b813cb"><name>ta-nehisi-rapp</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Humanities Institute to host acclaimed writer Ta-Nehisi Coates in special post-election event</title><summary>Coates will be in conversation with Adam Serwer, staff writer at The Atlantic magazine, to discuss his acclaimed novel "The Water Dancer"—as well as the state of the country after the election</summary><keywords>The Water Dancer, race, systemic racism, 2020 electionm,black lives matter, social justice, race in America, The Atlantic, journalism, UC Santa Cruz news, ucsc news, University of California news, Santa Cruz news, ucsc humanities, history, speculative fiction, historical fiction, post-election events</keywords><start-date>1605228900000</start-date><display-name>Humanities Institute: Ta-Nehisi Coates </display-name><path>/2020/11/ta-nehisi-rapp</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/11/ta-nehisi-rapp</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1605226151966</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1605231740922</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Academics</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/11/images/ta-nehisi-coates-headbook-500.png</path><link>site://news/2020/11/images/ta-nehisi-coates-headbook-500.png</link><site>news</site><name>ta-nehisi-coates-headbook-500.png</name><display-name>ta-nehisi-coates-headbook-500.png</display-name><file-size>401358</file-size><width>500</width><height>430</height></image><image-alt>Ta-Nehisi Coates and book cover of The Water Dancer</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/11/images/ta-nehesi-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/11/images/ta-nehesi-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ta-nehesi-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ta-nehesi-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15148</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Ta-Nehisi Coates</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu"><strong><i>The</i></strong> <strong><i>Humanities Institute</i></strong></a> at UC Santa Cruz, is partnering with Bookshop Santa Cruz and Marcus Bookstores in Oakland to offer a special online event with award-winning author and journalist </span><span><strong>Ta-Nehisi Coates</strong> on Friday, November 20th, at 6 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span>Coates will be in conversation with Adam Serwer, staff writer at <i>The Atlantic</i> magazine, to discuss his acclaimed novel <i>The Water Dancer&#8212;</i>as well as the state of the country after the election, truth telling, and the idea that stories and mythology can persuade and change attitudes when facts alone cannot.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>One of the most acclaimed writers in the United States, Coates gained a wide readership during his time as national correspondent at <i>The Atlantic</i>, where he wrote about cultural, social, and political issues, particularly regarding African Americans and white supremacy. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>In 2015, Coates won the National Book Award for <i>Between the World and Me</i>, a letter to his then 14-year-old son in which he warned about the perils of being African American. It was highly praised by Toni Morrison, who observed, </span><span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wondering who might fill the intellectual void that plagued me after James Baldwin died&#8230;clearly it is Ta-Nehisi Coates.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>He is also the author of the memoir <i>The Beautiful Struggle,</i> and&#160;<i>We Were Eight Years in Power</i>, a collection of essays about the intense, divided and emotional response to Barack Obama becoming the country&#8217;s first black president.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Set on a slave plantation</strong> in Virginia, Coates&#8217;s latest work is his debut novel, T<i>he Water Dancer,</i> about a fugitive slave who becomes an agent in the Underground, an organization devoted to the destruction of slavery in the United States during the mid-1800s. A blend of both historical and speculative fiction, it focuses on life after slavery, with an alternate historical timeline, and the protagonist&#8217;s ability to manipulate time and space.</span></p>
<p><span>As <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine noted in a recent review:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&#8220;</strong>Ta-Nehisi Coates is the most important essayist in a generation and a writer who changed the national political conversation about race with his 2015 memoir,&#160;<i>Between the World and Me</i>. So naturally his debut novel comes with slightly unrealistic expectations&#8212;and then proceeds to exceed them.&#160;<i>The Water Dancer</i> is a work of both staggering imagination and rich historical significance. . . . What&#8217;s most powerful is the way Coates enlists his notions of the fantastic, as well as his fluid prose, to probe a wound that never seems to heal. . . .Timeless&#160;and&#160;instantly canon-worthy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>This week, Oprah Winfrey and Brad Pitt </strong>announced that they are teaming up to adapt T<i>he Water Dancer</i>&#160;as a feature film for MGM. Winfrey&#8217;s Harpo Films and Pitt&#8217;s Plan B are producing along with Kamilah Forbes, who previously developed and directed&#160;the staged production&#160;of Coates&#8217;&#160;book, <i>Between the World and Me,</i>&#160;at the Apollo Theater and Kennedy Center.</span></p>
<p><span>Coates adapted his own novel, which was Winfrey&#8217;s first selection of her revived Oprah&#8217;s Book Club in partnership with Apple, and was listed as one of the best books of the year for 2019 by <i>Time</i>, NPR, <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>The</i>&#160;<i>Chicago Tribune</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i> and <i>Esquire</i>.</span></p>
<p><span>Earlier in July, HBO also announced that it was making Coates&#8217; award-winning book <i>Between the World and Me&#160;</i>into a TV special, with HBO&#8217;s president of programming noting that &#8220;Ta-Nehisi&#8217;s book is a modern literary classic that provides an essential message for our times.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>This event is being presented</strong> as part of The Humanities Institute&#8217;s 2020-2021 theme of <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/memory/"><strong><i>Memory</i></strong></a> and its significance in our lives&#8212;a yearlong discussion that includes events on transitional justice, indigenous resistance, and a <i>Questions That Matter</i> course on &#8220;Memory and the Americas.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>The idea is to explore what memory can tell us about our past, present, and future; the relationship between individual memory, collective memory, and history; and how memory is passed down through generations in order to build a better future.</span></p>

The message appears to come from the Career Center or often referred to as the job placement office, student services department, or even a specific professor. When you reply to the message, things start to get strange. The "employer" hires you without an interview. Then, they send you a check with instructions to purchase gift cards, money orders, prepaid debit cards, or other supplies you&#8217;ll need for your new job. However, <strong>the check is a fake</strong> &#8211; a detail your bank will let you know a day or two after you deposit it. Any money you sent to your "employer" is gone for good. Plus, you have to deal with the ramifications of a fake check with your bank.<br/><br/>Remember to <strong>never reveal personal information</strong> in email correspondence, phone, or text message to anyone you do not know. Further, members of the campus community are advised <strong>not to purchase gift cards and cash or deposit checks</strong> from unfamiliar companies. <br/><br/><strong>How to avoid employment scams:</strong><br/>
<ul>
<li><strong> Do your research.</strong> Before you say yes to any job, research the company that wants to hire you. Does the company have a professional website and legitimate contact information? Search for what others are saying about their experience with this company.</li>
<li><strong>Confirm your employment.</strong> Call the company back using a phone number listed online and verify you are speaking to the actual employee responsible for hiring.</li>
<li><strong>Beware of red flags.</strong> Scammers often send emails with many typos and grammatical errors. They offer to hire you without an interview and even pay you before you&#8217;ve done any work. None of these are behaviors of a reputable business.</li>
<li><strong>Never send money to strangers.</strong> Never send funds in the form of cash, checks, gift cards or wire transfers to someone you don&#8217;t know or haven&#8217;t met. No legitimate company will ask you to pay them to get a job.</li>
<li><strong>Do not provide your banking information.</strong> Until you confirm you are working with an actual business, that is actually hiring you, and not someone malicious. </li>
</ul>
<strong>Here are a few clues that the message is a forgery:</strong><br/><br/>
<ul>
<li>The email from address is from a generic email address such as '@gmail.com' or '@yahoo.com' versus a corporate business email address or a UCSC email address.</li>
<li>The potential employer is asking for personal information such as, street address, DOB, mobile number, and an alternative email (different from your @ucsc.edu email address).</li>
<li>The potential employer directs you to make purchases on their behalf such as supplies and/or gift cards, or blank checks.</li>
<li>The grammar and sentence structure is poor.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Remember:</strong> <br/>
<ul>
<li>If you receive an email containing a message that you did not expect, especially with words like "Internship" or "Work Assistant Needed" or &#8220;Employment" <strong>do not engage. </strong></li>
<li>If the email is unsolicited and offering money, <strong>do not engage.</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>What to do:</strong> <br/><br/>When you receive a phishing email, do not respond to it; instead, train your spam filter by reporting it to Google. No need to report phishing emails to the ITS Support Center unless you have responded directly to the phish.<br/><br/>To train your spam filter:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Open the message in Gmail (in your web browser)</li>
<li>Click the three vertical dots ' &#8942; ' next to reply</li>
<li>Choose 'Report phishing'</li>
</ul>
If you believe you have been a victim of fraud or identity theft, immediately notify your local police jurisdiction and cease all contact with the suspect organization. You can also contact the UC Santa Cruz Police Department Dispatch Center to speak with an officer at 831-459-2231 (option 1).<br/><br/><strong>For more information:</strong><br/><br/>To learn more about how to avoid employment scams, see <a href="https://www.bbb.org/article/tips/12261-bbb-tip-employment-scams" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BBB.org/EmploymentScam</a>.

To help our students, staff and faculty plan for the future, we write to update you about current campus plans for spring and summer instruction and housing. We continue to align with county and state guidelines and to prioritize public health and well-being, promote equitable access to education, and commit to high-quality instruction and student support in all of our planning.&#160;</span></p>

As we recover from the wildfire, ramp up COVID-19 testing capacity and continue to prepare buildings, we have been able to extend the opportunity for on-campus housing to additional students. We are hoping to house approximately 2,500 students in the winter quarter which was roughly our pre-fire, on-campus housing plan for fall quarter.&#160;</span></p>

<p>Natalie Batalha, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, will lead the consortium, one of eight new research teams selected by NASA to inaugurate its <a href="https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/research/astrobiology-at-nasa/icar/">Interdisciplinary Consortia for Astrobiology Research</a> (ICAR) program. In addition to UCSC, the consortium includes researchers at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, University of Colorado, Boulder, University of Kansas, and NASA Ames Research Center.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to understand the physical processes that impact planetary atmospheres,&#8221; Batalha said. &#8220;We must understand those physical processes and their effects in the absence of life so that we will be able to recognize the signs of life when we see them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Batalha served as the project scientist for NASA&#8217;s highly successful Kepler Mission, which discovered more than 2,500 exoplanets. A <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/kepler-occurrence-rate">recent analysis of Kepler data</a> suggests there are at least 300 million potentially habitable worlds in our galaxy. Batalha noted, however, that a planet in the &#8220;habitable zone&#8221; of its star (where liquid water could pool on the planet&#8217;s surface) is not guaranteed to be a truly habitable environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the takeaways from the Kepler Mission is that the diversity of exoplanets in the galaxy far exceeds the diversity of our own solar system,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If we want to understand the diversity of rocky, habitable zone planets, we have to study the physical processes that sculpt the atmospheres of all planets&#8212;even those not amenable to life as we know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Batalha&#8217;s team, that means &#8220;following the volatiles,&#8221; tracing the path of the volatile elements like carbon and oxygen that make up a planet&#8217;s atmosphere. That path goes from star-forming clouds into protoplanetary disks, to the building blocks of planets, and eventually into planets themselves, where volatile elements can move between the surface, atmosphere, and interior, and even be lost to space.</p>
<p>The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2021 will usher in a new era of exoplanet exploration and the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. The consortium will develop the tools needed to interpret observations of exoplanet atmospheres made by JWST and the latest generation of ground-based telescopes.</p>
<p>The researchers will address four fundamental science questions: What is the inventory of volatiles in planetary building blocks? What are a planet&#8217;s external sources and sinks of volatiles (in other words, where do they come from and where do they go)? How are volatiles distributed between a planet&#8217;s interior, surface, and atmosphere? And what can atmospheric observations tell us about the volatile inventories and chemistries of exoplanets?</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Hawaii led by Eric Gaidos will investigate the formation of planets and their volatile content using astronomical observations of protoplanetary disks and young planets, laboratory experiments that simulate conditions in the interiors of planetesimals and growing planets, and analysis of meteorites and samples returned from asteroids.</p>
<p>Meredith MacGregor at the University of Colorado, Boulder, will lead analysis of circumstellar disk observations using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) combined with other ground-based observatories. She will also coordinate multi-wavelength observing campaigns to explore the properties of and mechanisms behind stellar flaring in order to better understand how these events can damage planetary atmospheres over time.</p>
<p>Ian Crossfield at the University of Kansas will lead isotopic abundance analyses of exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and dwarf stars. He will also consult and assist with the planning and analysis of Hubble Space Telescope and JWST spectroscopy of nearby exoplanets. Thomas Greene is leading the effort at NASA Ames Research Center to provide guaranteed-time JWST observations of exoplanet atmospheres and model their chemical abundances, clouds, and photochemical effects.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our team has a broad range of expertise and unparalleled access to the telescopes and facilities needed to carry out this research and meet the challenge of not just finding life on other worlds, but having confidence that we can identify signatures of life when we see them,&#8221; Batalha said.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, the team includes faculty in two departments, Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics and Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences (EPS). Jonathan Fortney, professor of astronomy and astrophysics and director of the Other Worlds Laboratory, will conduct theoretical and modeling work on exoplanet structure and atmospheres; Ruth Murray-Clay, the Gunderson Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics, will conduct a wide array of theoretical work, including the physics of disk structure and evolution and the processes of atmospheric mass loss.</p>
<p>Francis Nimmo, professor of EPS, will model planetesimal volatile acquisition and retention; Myriam Telus, assistant professor of EPS, will study meteorite outgassing and cosmochemistry; and Xi Zhang, assistant professor of EPS, will model exoplanet atmospheres and help interpret exoplanet spectra in the context of cloud physics. Andrew Skemer, associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics, and Rebecca Jensen-Clem, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics, will also contribute to the consortium.</p>
<p>Batalha, who leads UCSC&#8217;s interdisciplinary <a href="https://astrobiology.science.ucsc.edu/">Astrobiology Initiative</a>, said the NASA ICAR award is a testament to the strength of UCSC&#8217;s faculty in this area of research.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came to UC Santa Cruz knowing that the pieces were in place already for a strong astrobiology program. This funding allows us build on that foundation and means that astrobiology at UCSC can flourish,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The UCSC Office of Research provided seed funding for the Astrobiology Initiative.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cac3462d8072701708c0293fb884eb19"><name>is-12-ucsc-communications</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Presidential Policy Business and Finance Bulletin IS-12 IT Recovery.</title><start-date>1605081600000</start-date><display-name>IS-12 UCSC Communications</display-name><path>/2020/11/is-12-ucsc-communications</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/11/is-12-ucsc-communications</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1605424596497</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1605424658347</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Campus Updates</value><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California Office of the President invites comments on a proposed Presidential Policy Business and Finance Bulletin IS-12 IT Recovery.

<p>The Research Center for the Americas will receive $180,000 to support the <a href="https://rca.ucsc.edu/directors-initiatives/human-rights-lab/index.html">Human Rights Investigations Lab</a>, which trains students to document international conflicts using open-source internet investigation techniques. And the <a href="https://everettprogram.ucsc.edu/">Everett Program</a>, a student-led initiative pursuing technology and social change work since the late 1990s, will receive $90,000 to develop online teaching modules and curriculum disseminating best practices for supporting student-led tech projects.</p>
<p>The Human Rights Investigations Lab, founded in 2019, is a relatively new research project that's already generating global impact. Their PIT-UN funding, with added support from the Division of Graduate Studies and <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/#slide2">The Humanities Institute</a>, will bring in more experts to mentor students across fields ranging from digital verification to cybersecurity to law, depending on the needs of a particular investigation.</p>
<p>Sylvanna Falc&#243;n, the lab's director, says this grant will further enrich the tech proficiency students gain through the program, which has served them well not only in their human rights investigations, but also in the job market and everyday life.</p>
<p>"The digital literacy skills students have developed have helped them engage on this massive platform of the internet in a responsible way," Falc&#243;n said. "My students tell me they'll never look at the internet the same way again."</p>
<p>Both PIT-UN funded projects at UC Santa Cruz are geared toward empowering students from non-STEM fields to apply technology effectively, and both aim to diversify tech leadership.</p>
<p>"We work with populations that have been marginalized from STEM education to bring tech tools for them to express themselves, curate information, and create technology," said Juhee Kang, principal investigator for the Everett Program's PIT-UN grant. "Rather than just producing the workforce that Silicon Valley needs, we can produce students with the right mindset and skills who can inspire the industry and even change the industry's behavior."</p>
<p>Students in the Everett Program build their tech knowledge and soft skills in order to support community partners with creative digital storytelling and activism via video content, website or app development, social media campaigns, and data visualizations. PIT-UN funding will help the program collect both evaluation data and success stories from throughout its history. The findings will be packaged into an online toolkit for use by educators across the country.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz first joined the <a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/work/pit-un/">PIT-UN</a> in early 2020, with Chris Benner, director of the Everett Program and the <a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/">Institute for Social Transformation</a>, and Michael Matkin, assistant director of <a href="https://citris-uc.org/">CITRIS and the Banatao Institute</a>, overseeing the effort. Their goal is to integrate the diverse range of initiatives taking place across campus related to public interest technology.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled that both these important projects were recognized by the PIT-UN leadership and have this opportunity to develop," Matkin said, regarding the recent grant awards. "We encourage everyone on campus doing work that explores any aspect of technology in the public interest to join us in strengthening the network here at UC Santa Cruz."</p>
<p>The broader PIT-UN is a partnership of 36 colleges and universities convened by New America, the Ford Foundation, and the Hewlett Foundation to build the field of public interest technology. Through curriculum development, faculty research opportunities, and experiential learning programs, the network is inspiring a new generation of civic-minded technologists and policy leaders.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d757d79f807270172c1b96bdb800a251"><name>deadline-for-benefits-open-enrollment-is-soon</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Deadline for Benefits Open Enrollment is Soon!</title><summary>This is the time of year when you can change your benefits coverage to better meet your medical needs and personal budget.

UC Santa Cruz has received more than $26 million in CIRM funding since 2005.</p>
<p>CIRM was created when California voters approved a bond measure for $3 billion in 2004. The bond money was used to fund research grants, clinical trials, new laboratories, and training programs throughout the state. With unallocated funds running out, supporters of the agency sought additional money through Proposition 14, which authorized $5.5 billion in new funding for CIRM.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, past funding from CIRM has enabled the establishment of the <a href="https://ibsc.ucsc.edu/">Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells</a> (IBSC), including a stem cell research facility shared by faculty in several departments, as well as training programs for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Since its start in 2005, the IBSC has built a cohesive interdisciplinary stem cell research community at UCSC. It brings together 27 laboratories led by faculty from five different departments and two divisions.</p>
<p>Individual faculty members have also received major research grants from CIRM, including Camilla Forsberg, professor of biomolecular engineering and co-director of the Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells.</p>
<p>&#8220;CIRM has been quite good about funding both research and training, as well as infrastructure,&#8221; Forsberg said. &#8220;At UCSC, we have been able to establish research infrastructure and resources we wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have, recruit new faculty, and provide opportunities for students at all levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campus has also been able to leverage CIRM&#8217;s investments to attract additional funding from other sources, such as a recent $4.2 million grant to the IBSC from the National Institutes of Health for a postdoctoral training and mentorship program.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of our best products is the researchers who get rigorous training at UC Santa Cruz and go on to work in the biotech industry in California and at institutions around the world, where many are now running their own labs,&#8221; Forsberg said.</p>
<p>Through its funding for research, training, and new facilities, CIRM aims to accelerate the pace of stem cell research in California. The vast majority of funds go to advance research and the development of new therapies, with the goal of fast-tracking stem cell treatments to patients with unmet medical needs. By promoting and encouraging the growth of the stem cell biotechnology sector, the agency is also helping attract the best scientists to the state and establishing California as a global leader in stem cell research.</p>
<p>&#8220;The renewal of CIRM funding offers terrific opportunities for our faculty to use the innovative technologies being developed in UCSC labs to advance therapies and cures for devastating diseases and injuries,&#8221; said Lindsay Hinck, professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology and co-director of the Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d87a8e67807270172c1b96bd9094eb37"><name>interim-chief-feature</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Interim chief to focus on listening, building understanding</title><summary>Lt.

<p dir="ltr"><span>Prior to joining UCSC, she served in the UC Davis Police Department where she held a number of assignments including patrol, detective, bike patrol, and field training officer. She began her career in the City of Davis Police Department.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the following interview, Garcia talks about the personal and professional experiences that have shaped her approach to her work.&#160;</span></p>
<h5 dir="ltr"><span>Where did you grow up?</span></h5>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I grew up in Yolo County, about two-and-half hours from Santa Cruz in a small town. Yolo County is an agricultural area with many farm workers. I am a first generation college graduate.&#160; My parents were both farm laborers and my dad still works in the fields, even as he nears 70 years of age.&#160; My brothers and sisters and I were required to work summers in the fields as soon as we turned 14 when we could get a work permit. Our earnings went straight into the family funds to maintain basic needs. Working in the fields was to teach us the value of hard work, while also emphasizing the importance of education to change our station in life and have a better life.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As the oldest child, I learned English first, and I became the family translator immediately.&#160; My mom required me to learn how to read and write Spanish.&#160; We were only allowed to speak Spanish at home so we would not lose our language. I became a huge reader and still am.&#160; I was blessed to have a neighbor who happened to be a teacher. She introduced me to the public library and I became a lifelong learner and reader from then on. Reading helped me learn both languages fluently and I&#8217;m grateful my mom required these skills of her children.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>My parents did not have money to pay for college. Between student loans, having sometimes three jobs, all while attending college, I obtained my bachelor&#8217;s degree. I now have two masters degrees and am considering continuing my education with a Ph.D.</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span>Why did you decide to work in higher education?&#160;</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I like working with people in the community. When I joined the UC Davis Police Department, engaging with students and staff was welcome and encouraged in both directions. As officers, we could focus on and spend extra time to build relationships, trust, and really provide the level of service and support needed. I didn&#8217;t intend to stay in a police officer role, but being part of the UC Davis community and staying became a natural fit.</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span>What have been your proudest moments as an officer?&#160;&#160;</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Connecting with people on a personal level and earning their trust. Taking the time to get to know someone, even if it's for a brief moment, because it's what is natural to me.&#160; Having students and community members come back to me years later to thank me for taking extra time with them and listening, providing advice based on my personal life experience, has been a touching surprise every time.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The animated movie </span><em>Ferdinan</em><span><em>d</em> has one of my favorite scenes that encompasses all of this for me. Angus thanks Ferdinand for helping him see by licking Angus&#8217;s hair off his face. Ferdinand says it wasn&#8217;t a big deal, but Angus says something like &#8220;it was a big deal to me.&#8221;&#160; That scene in </span><em>Ferdinand</em><span> resonates with me because it's a huge life lesson. It emphasizes we all have value to others, even when we don&#8217;t know it.&#160; We can all learn from each other, even if we don&#8217;t realize it at that moment.</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span>What have been the most challenging moments?</span><span>&#160;&#160;</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Facing my own community of color when all they see of me&#8212; as a Mexican woman&#8212;is the uniform.&#160; I am a helper who happens to be in uniform and that&#8217;s the hardest part for me to reconcile. How my chosen role as a police officer can be a barrier for helping. There have been many instances of this, but my hardest call specific to this challenge was about 3 years ago at UC Davis.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I was the sergeant on night shift and my team and I were responding to a call for a student who had ingested many pills and was in danger.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The student and the student&#8217;s friend refused to accept help from me as a police officer.&#160; I offered to leave and pleaded with them to take the ambulance to the hospital.&#160; I was scared we were losing valuable time to save the student&#8217;s life the more we talked. The student continued to refuse the ambulance.&#160; I appealed to them in Spanish asking them what I&#8217;m supposed to tell the student&#8217;s parents if the student died refusing help.&#160; After many back and forths, the student accepted.&#160; In the car, I tried to get to know both of them, but they would barely engage. Our role there was to try to save the student.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A week later I arrived at work to find flowers, fruit, and a kind card from the student&#8217;s mom.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In my life, with my background, I know there is a lot in this world I don&#8217;t know and that I didn&#8217;t know how to access as a person of color from a poor family living in a small town.&#160; Not knowing about something not only obstructs upward mobility, but it also perpetuates fears and can lead to being held back either by our own fear or by systems in place. This is why I want to increase understanding, dialogue, and transparency within our campus community.</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span>There was an incident in 2004 when you and other UC Davis officers had to respond to a disorderly off-campus block party involving an estimated 1,000 people. You were one of several officers who fired pepper balls to dissipate the crowd, which was throwing bottles and objects at officers. During the incident, a student was injured. While it is unclear who was responsible for the actual injury, you and several other officers were named in a civil lawsuit brought by the student. The lawsuit was settled by the city of Davis and UC Davis.</span></h4>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span>You&#8217;ve been open about this incident. What have you learned from it? How did it change you as an officer?&#160;</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This terrible incident taught me to take the time&#8212;when possible&#8212;to consider unforeseen consequences of decisions and actions. In this instance, given the training and experience I had in the use of pepperball, we were trained not to fire projectiles at people, but at surfaces such as walls, floors, and hard objects. I followed my training and it was very hard to learn that someone was injured.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I believe we are always learning and every day presents us with moments to reflect on what we did or did not do in any given situation. I find the most value in reflecting on ways to improve.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I also learned, when possible, to ask questions of myself and others about an incident. Much of what I have learned I have applied to my life as I have grown and developed since then. I am not the same person I was 16 years ago.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In an interaction, I ask myself &#8220;What is the goal? What do I intend to accomplish during this contact, meeting, or call for service?&#8221; Knowing this helps me tailor how I can best meet the needs of whoever I&#8217;m with or what outcome is best.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I always look for opportunities to learn and improve based on my experiences.&#160;</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span>What has been your lived experience as a Latina police officer?</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The hardest parts about being a police officer have been how others perceive me because for some there&#8217;s a clash as to who I am, what my role is as an officer, and how the communities see me or what assumptions they make of me.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It wasn&#8217;t until recently when I heard a police chief from another agency speak about his experience as a person of color in law enforcement that I realized my experience was much like his.&#160; He put into words what I couldn&#8217;t.&#160; He talked about how we, as persons of color, inherently carry a different and higher level of responsibility in law enforcement and our communities of color.&#160; We have a responsibility to represent our cultures and people with respect and dignity in law enforcement.&#160; It is also our responsibility to represent law enforcement equally to and within our communities of color. It&#8217;s what I have worked hard to do in the way I carry myself and the way I perform my duties to the best of my abilities and the circumstances I am faced with.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span>Police and their practices are under intense scrutiny nationwide, following the killing of George Floyd and many other unarmed black people. What do you think about this moment? How do you think police departments should change?</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As departments, we need to have a true understanding of the symbolism of our societal history and role in it as police. The gravity of the loss of life requires us to make a decision and take actions to do things differently. Not just in police departments, but as entire communities. Because we are all in this community.&#160; To consider there are different ways of doing things, all with the consideration that sometimes things happen that are beyond our control and sphere of influence.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>When deaths such as George Floyd&#8217;s happen, it is a human tragedy that affects us all. We are human and we have human emotional reactions to the unnecessary loss of life.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>An analogy I use about bringing forth change is to think about relationships with family members or partners.&#160; Sometimes those relationships&#8212;except in certain circumstances&#8212;are damaged so severely that relationship seems beyond repair.&#160; But if the involved parties want to salvage that relationship, it's a matter of declaring &#8216;we start here&#8217; and agreeing to do so. We all have to be willing to listen. Growth and progress can&#8217;t happen without collaboration and it can&#8217;t be a one way street.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d8c4545a807270172c1b96bd639a1f03"><name>update-on-community-safety</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Update on community safety</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz, like many universities and cities across the country, is in the midst of critically examining our structures so that we can address real concerns about policing, community safety, and the barriers to creating a sense of belonging for all in our campus community. </summary><start-date>1605657600000</start-date><display-name>Update on community safety</display-name><path>/2020/11/update-on-community-safety</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/11/update-on-community-safety</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1605659546688</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1605659546688</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>UC Santa Cruz, like many universities and cities across the country, is in the midst of critically examining our structures so that we can address real concerns about policing, community safety, and the barriers to creating a sense of belonging for all in our campus community.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A critical element in advancing this effort is our Campus Safety Community Advisory Board, which now reports directly to the chancellor. The board, made up of students, faculty, and staff, has already met twice and is beginning to develop its work plan for the academic year ahead. Some of the areas it will review include protests and free speech events, harm reduction, community engagement, and accountability.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Additionally, changes in leadership provide the university with an opportunity for review and new perspectives on how we approach our work.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Earlier this fall, UC Santa Cruz Police Chief Nader Oweis announced his retirement after 27 years of service to the University of California, nine of which were at UC Santa Cruz. He will assume new leadership responsibilities as the chief of police at Sonoma State University.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the weeks to come, additional information will be shared about the plan for recruiting a new police chief. The goal is to develop a process that includes ample stakeholder engagement early on, so that it can shape the recruitment, the candidate profile that meets the needs of our campus community, and ultimately how a new chief will lead the department.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The current dialogue taking place nationally and on our campus regarding policing requires leadership that can engage deeply with the members of the campus community.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Beginning Dec. 5, Mary Garcia, a lieutenant in the UC Santa Cruz Police Department, will assume the role of interim chief of police. She will continue to seek opportunities for community and law enforcement collaborations to strengthen relationships and build trust.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Garcia has 23 years of law enforcement experience, and has been at UC Santa Cruz since 2019. She currently oversees the training and investigations units.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Prior to her arrival on campus, she served in the UC Davis Police Department where she held a number of assignments including patrol, detective, bike patrol, and field training officer. She began her career in the City of Davis Police Department.</span></p>

<p><span>How do we proceed in a country that is so politically and culturally divided during a time when the </span><span>world&#8217;s oldest democracies are under threat?</span></p>
<p><span>On December 5, UC Santa Cruz will present &#8220;Living in a Frayed Democracy&#8221;--a trans-Atlantic public dialogue featuring noted UCSC alumnus and journalist&#160;<strong>Ezra Klein</strong> and London political economist <strong>William Davies</strong>&#8212;</span><span>as part of the Humanities Division&#8217;s <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/projects/peggy-downs-baskin-ethics-lecture-series/"><strong><i>Peggy Downes Baskin Ethics Lecture Series</i></strong></a>.</span></p>
<p><span>They will discuss how and why we got to this difficult moment in history, the ways in which the U.S. and U.K. are facing similar predicaments, and where things might go from here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Winner of the 2020 <i>Webby</i> and <i>People's Voice</i> awards for best interview podcast, Klein is the editor-at-large and co-founder of <i>Vox</i>, the news organization launched in 2014 that now reaches more than 50 million people across its platforms each month.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Before that, he was a columnist and editor at the <i>Washington Post</i>, a policy analyst at <i>MSNBC</i>, and a contributor to <i>Bloomberg</i>. He&#8217;s also written for the <i>New Yorker</i> and the <i>New York Review of Books</i>, and appeared on a variety of programs including <i>Face the Nation</i>, the <i>Daily Show, Real Time with Bill Maher, PBS NewsHour, The Colbert Report</i>, and <i>The McLaughlin Group.</i></span></p>
<p><span>Klein is additionally the author of the 2020 best-selling book, <i>Why We&#8217;re Polarized</i>, in which he details the structural and psychological forces behind America&#8217;s fall into division and dysfunction.</span></p>
<p><span>Klein argues that America&#8217;s political system isn&#8217;t broken, but that the truth is much scarier, because the system is working exactly the way it was designed.</span></p>
<p><span>As he notes in the book, &#8220;The American political system&#8212;which includes everyone from voters to journalists to the president&#8212;is full of rational actors making rational decisions given the incentives they face. We are a collection of functional parts whose efforts combine into a dysfunctional whole.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>William Davies</strong> is a political economist at Goldsmiths, University of London, where he is also </span><span>co-director of the Political Economy Research Centre</span><span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>His </span><span>work focuses on the history of ideas and how expert knowledge shapes politics and society today, with a particular interest in the science of happiness, distrust in experts, and the present crisis of liberalism.</span></p>
<p><span>A regular contributor to the <i>London Review of Books</i> and <i>The Guardian</i>, Davies has also written for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>New Republic</i> and <i>The Atlantic</i>.</span></p>
<p><span>He is the author of several books, including <i>This Is Not Normal: The Collapse of Liberal Britain</i>; <i>Nervous States: How Feeling Took Over the World</i>;</span><span> and <i>The Happiness Industry: How the Government &amp; Big Business Sold Us Wellbeing</i>, as well as editor of <i>Economic Science Fictions</i>.</span></p>

Ping is one of 36 scientists and engineers to receive grants this year through the Air Force&#8217;s Young Investigator Research Program, which recognizes young researchers who show exceptional ability and promise.</p>
<p>Ping is developing theoretical and computational approaches to guide the design of new materials for quantum computing and other quantum information technologies. With the new grant, she aims to develop a computational framework to investigate real-time quantum dynamics with coupled spins, electrons, photons, and phonons.</p>
<p>Spin is a fundamental property of electrons and other particles, and the rapidly growing field of spintronics uses spin states in a manner analogous to the use of electrical charge in electronics. Spin can be used as the basis for qubits (quantum bits) and single-photon emitters in applications of quantum information science, including quantum computation, communication, and sensing.</p>
<p>A key property for spintronics and quantum information science is the lifetime of the spin states, known as the spin relaxation and decoherence time. Ping&#8217;s work will answer important questions about how spin lifetime varies in two-dimensional materials. This research will also help determine design rules for tuning and constructing new 2D interfaces with ideal physical properties for spintronics and quantum information science.</p>
<p>The Air Force's Young Investigator Research Program aims to foster creative basic research in science and engineering, enhance early career development of outstanding young investigators, and increase opportunities for the young investigators to recognize the Air Force mission and the related challenges in science and engineering.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e1e06498807270172c1b96bd1c64f0e1"><name>faculty-regents</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Statement on UC Regents session on faculty dismissal </title><start-date>1605772800000</start-date><display-name>Faculty dismissal</display-name><path>/2020/11/faculty-regents</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/11/faculty-regents</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1605812380785</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1606161621637</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>While personnel issues are traditionally dealt with in closed session as provided by law, Professor Ramakrishna "Ram" Akella requested that the presentation of the requested action be done during the open session of the Regents November 19 meeting. The Regents complied with the request.</p>
<p>Chancellor Cynthia Larive, in agreement with the campus Committee on Privilege and Tenure, has recommended the UC Board of Regents dismiss Professor Akella for violating the Faculty Code of Conduct by failing to teach assigned courses.</p>
<p>Teaching students is a core responsibility of any UCSC faculty member. This professor&#8217;s refusal to teach assigned courses interfered with our central mission and negatively affected students and colleagues. UC Santa Cruz is committed to the success of its students and ensuring they can enroll in courses that help them earn a degree. Refusing to fulfill one of his fundamental duties is unacceptable.</p>

Many ideas were considered, and four emerged as clear priorities that warranted further investigation. I am excited to lay out for you today the campus initiatives we are moving to a discovery phase:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Create online degree programs;&#160;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Grow our Summer Session;&#160;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Implement a formalized campus budget process;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Study the possibility of converting to a semester-based academic calendar.&#160;</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We are now assembling small groups that represent different facets and organizations on campus to investigate the opportunities and risks presented by each project, identify stakeholders, and estimate the required resources, anticipated benefits, and possible alternatives. In this discovery phase, each team will develop a comprehensive understanding of the initiative and chart a path forward. Each project will progress on its own timeline.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Online courses and degree programs</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Our current campus response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the necessary reliance on remote and online instruction, is a change in practice that reveals how technology and instructional design can expand our teaching and learning spaces beyond the constraints of physical location. While our current environment is far from ideal, it does prompt us to examine the possibilities for access to our instructional programs. The development of fully online degree programs, both at the bachelor&#8217;s and master&#8217;s levels, would benefit both our campus community and the many California residents unable to relocate to Santa Cruz to earn a UC degree. Growing our online programs would also allow us to meet state demand for access to UC programs, without the need to build more classrooms or dorms. Expanding enrollment would also boost revenue, provide more support opportunities for our graduate students, and strengthen our position to hire more faculty. This initiative is being headed up by Herbie Lee, Vice Provost for Academic Affairs, and Tracy Larrabee, Senate Committee on Educational Policy Chair and Professor of Computer Science and Engineering.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Grow our Summer Session&#160;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Our Summer Session has seen seven consecutive years of sustained and accelerated growth, punctuated by 38 percent growth this past summer. Summer Session participation is a significant factor in undergraduate student outcomes, and has large and positive benefits for the campus including graduate student and faculty employment, tuition and enrollment revenue, and housing and other revenue-generating services. We have made changes to various aspects of the program since 2013. This initiative is the next step. Setting a goal of continued enrollment growth of 10 to 15 percent annually will further improve undergraduate time to degree and boost campus revenue. This initiative is being headed up by Richard Hughey, Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education, and P.K. Agarwal, Dean of University Extension.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Institute a campus budget process structure</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This effort aims to define an annual budget and funding allocation process. Our annual budgeting and resource-distribution processes have historically been driven by incremental mandatory cost increases and ad hoc spending requests. Consequently, it is difficult to engage in multi-year planning and to provide resource transparency. There are a number of budget related projects currently underway including implementing standard reporting, and a proposed new resource allocation methodology that, along with a formal budget process, will enable the campus to have a common and consistent understanding of available resources across organizations and functions. Moving to a more formal and structured budgeting process will allow campus leaders and managers to make financial decisions that support campus values and priorities and divisional goals. This initiative is being headed by Kimberly Register, Budget Director, and Dard Neuman, Senate Committee on Planning and Budget Chair and Associate Professor of Music.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Study the change to a semester-based academic calendar&#160;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This initiative will consider a possible academic calendar change, from quarters to semesters, and what challenges and opportunities that change could spark. This initiative is being headed by Paul Koch, Dean of Physical and Biological Sciences and Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences, and Jennifer Baszile, interim Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Student Success. The discovery phase will start in January 2021 for this project.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In this discovery phase project charters will be developed which will allow for input and consultation on the goals, approach, staffing, and timing of the initiative and create the necessary context for decisions on whether or not to proceed. While this work begins this year, I fully anticipate these projects to be active over the next few years. As this phase proceeds, more information will be shared. In the meantime, I extend my appreciation to all of the project leaders and their teams as they begin their work.&#160;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz faculty and staff</audience><admin>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e7997ada807270172c1b96bd691b9149"><name>winter-break-reverting-to-dec-24-jan-3</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Winter break reverting to Dec. 24 to Jan. 3</title><summary>We very much appreciate the feedback we received from so many of you regarding UC Santa Cruz's planned winter curtailment. </summary><start-date>1605859200000</start-date><display-name>Winter break reverting to Dec. 24 to Jan. 3</display-name><path>/2020/11/winter-break-reverting-to-dec-24-jan-3</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/11/winter-break-reverting-to-dec-24-jan-3</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1605908396721</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1605908396721</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>Dear Colleagues,</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We very much appreciate the feedback we received from so many of you regarding UC Santa Cruz's planned winter curtailment. Together we received letters and emails from many staff and faculty members, as well as input from the Academic Senate Executive Committee, Staff Advisory Board, and members of the chancellor&#8217;s cabinet. The response was overwhelmingly in favor of reverting back to the original, three-day curtailment period.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We heard you, and we have received approval from the Office of the President to make this change. The winter break will now begin Dec. 24 and end Jan. 3 with Dec. 28-30 as three days of campus curtailment that can be taken using vacation leave. Staff who wish to use vacation or other approved leave during the Dec. 21-23 period may do so with their supervisor&#8217;s approval.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We anticipate that the Office of the President&#8217;s wider curtailment proposal will be shared soon. We will communicate once the details of the UCOP plan are known.</span></p>

They are Matthew Wagers, associate professor of linguistics, and Fitnat Yildiz, professor of microbiology and environmental toxicology.</p>
<p>Wagers was recognized &#8220;for innovative research extending the methodology of experimental psycholinguistics to investigations of understudied minority languages.&#8221;</p>
<p>He specializes in the study of psycholinguistics and language comprehension, with a focus on the way sentence structure is stored or accessed in memory. The study of language comprehension has the potential to shed light on how the mind integrates general knowledge with past experiences to deal with new situations.</p>
<p>Wagers was principal investigator on a National Science Foundation-funded project to study Chamorro, an Austronesian language of Micronesia, spoken by 45,000 people in the Mariana Islands. He recently received a new NSF grant to work with speakers of indigenous Oaxacan languages in California and Oaxaca. This project explores a fundamental aspect of cognition: how language users refer to the world around them through their system of pronouns, and how this system is shaped by animacy (how much something is conceived of as alive or human). It also compares Zapotec, a language that has not been studied much by linguists, and modern Hebrew, a language that is much better understood.</p>
<p>Yildiz was recognized &#8220;for distinguished contributions to the field of microbiology, particularly for study of bacterial signal transduction pathways and molecular mechanisms of biofilm formation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yildiz is a leading authority on the microbial communities known as biofilms, which grow on surfaces and are enclosed in a protective matrix. Her lab focuses on biofilm formation and its consequences in the infection cycle of the cholera pathogen <em>Vibrio cholerae</em>, which causes periodic, seasonal outbreaks of disease in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>Biofilms are important in causing cholera infections as well as in the survival of cholera bacteria in the environment. Studies from Yildiz&#8217;s lab have significantly advanced the understanding of the mechanisms and regulation of biofilm formation and what makes the biofilm more infectious than free-swimming bacteria. These findings help pave the way for developing strategies to predict and control cholera epidemics, and may also help in identification of novel drug targets for inhibiting biofilm formation and treating infections.</p>
<p>Election as a AAAS Fellow is an honor bestowed upon AAAS members by their peers. This year, 489 members have been awarded this honor by AAAS because of their scientifically or socially distinguished efforts to advance science or its applications.</p>
<p>The 2020 AAAS Fellows will be formally announced in the AAAS News &amp; Notes section of the journal <em>Science</em> on November 27, 2020.

Researchers at UC Santa Cruz have now achieved the first direct visualization of quantum dots in bilayer graphene, revealing the shape of the quantum wave function of the trapped electrons.</p>
<p>The results, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c03453">published November 23 in <em>Nano Letters</em></a>, provide important fundamental knowledge needed to develop quantum information technologies based on bilayer graphene quantum dots.</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been a lot of work to develop this system for quantum information science, but we&#8217;ve been missing an understanding of what the electrons look like in these quantum dots,&#8221; said corresponding author Jairo Velasco Jr., assistant professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>While conventional digital technologies encode information in bits represented as either 0 or 1, a quantum bit, or qubit, can represent both states at the same time due to quantum superposition. In theory, technologies based on qubits will enable a massive increase in computing speed and capacity for certain types of calculations.</p>
<p>A variety of systems, based on materials ranging from diamond to gallium arsenide, are being explored as platforms for creating and manipulating qubits. Bilayer graphene (two layers of graphene, which is a two-dimensional arrangement of carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice) is an attractive material because it is easy to produce and work with, and quantum dots in bilayer graphene have desirable properties.</p>
<p>&#8220;These quantum dots are an emergent and promising platform for quantum information technology because of their suppressed spin decoherence, controllable quantum degrees of freedom, and tunability with external control voltages,&#8221; Velasco said.</p>
<p>Understanding the nature of the quantum dot wave function in bilayer graphene is important because this basic property determines several relevant features for quantum information processing, such as the electron energy spectrum, the interactions between electrons, and the coupling of electrons to their environment.</p>
<p>Velasco&#8217;s team used a method he had developed previously to create quantum dots in monolayer graphene using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). With the graphene resting on an insulating hexagonal boron nitride crystal, a large voltage applied with the STM tip creates charges in the boron nitride that serve to electrostatically confine electrons in the bilayer graphene.</p>
<p>&#8220;The electric field creates a corral, like an invisible electric fence, that traps the electrons in the quantum dot,&#8221; Velasco explained.</p>
<p>The researchers then used the scanning tunneling microscope to image the electronic states inside and outside of the corral. In contrast to theoretical predictions, the resulting images showed a broken rotational symmetry, with three peaks instead of the expected concentric rings.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see circularly symmetric rings in monolayer graphene, but in bilayer graphene the quantum dot states have a three-fold symmetry,&#8221; Velasco said. &#8220;The peaks represent sites of high amplitude in the wave function. Electrons have a dual wave-particle nature, and we are visualizing the wave properties of the electron in the quantum dot.&#8221;</p>
<p>This work provides crucial information, such as the energy spectrum of the electrons, needed to develop quantum devices based on this system. &#8220;It is advancing the fundamental understanding of the system and its potential for quantum information technologies,&#8221; Velasco said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a missing piece of the puzzle, and taken together with the work of others, I think we&#8217;re moving toward making this a useful system.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Velasco, the authors of the paper include co-first authors Zhehao Ge, Frederic Joucken, and Eberth Quezada-Lopez at UC Santa Cruz, along with coauthors at the Federal University of Ceara, Brazil, the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan, University of Minnesota, and UCSC&#8217;s Baskin School of Engineering. This work was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Army Research Office.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f6bae8a2807270172c1b96bd3c9613f8"><name>office-of-the-president-job-protection-plan</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Office of the President Plan for Jobs Protection during the Pandemic</title><summary>Today, UC President Michael Drake communicated his plan for Jobs Protection during the Pandemic to minimize, to the extent feasible, layoffs associated with diminished revenues due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.</summary><start-date>1606118400000</start-date><display-name>Office of the President Plan for Jobs Protection during the Pandemic</display-name><path>/2020/11/office-of-the-president-job-protection-plan</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/11/office-of-the-president-job-protection-plan</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1606162245765</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1606162325753</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>Dear Colleagues,</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>We believe the fiscally conservative measures our campus adopted beginning in March to limit hiring through position management and curb spending for travel and other items, in addition to our initially solid financial position at the start of the pandemic, has positioned us to be able to meet our Relief Fund target through central funds.

This approach will allow us to meet the Relief Fund target without applying additional budget cuts to units or initiating campus-wide pay reduction, furlough, or curtailment programs in this fiscal year. We will seek consultation with the Academic Senate Committee on Planning and Budget, and ask for input and feedback from the Staff Advisory Board, the Chancellor&#8217;s Cabinet and others in the days ahead.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We are grateful to the faculty and staff who provided feedback through our survey in early November regarding the President&#8217;s initial curtailment proposal. This feedback from UCSC and the other campuses clearly contributed to the flexibility inherent in the President&#8217;s plan. We are also grateful to the staff in Staff Human Resources who have worked tirelessly to create a robust temporary redeployment program to help keep staff &#8212; impacted by COVID-19 reductions in workload &#8212; employed and engaged at UCSC.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last Friday, Coates, in a live conversation hosted by </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Humanities Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at UC Santa Cruz, in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">partnership with </span><a href="https://www.bookshopsantacruz.com/waterdancer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bookshop Santa Cruz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/marcus.books/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcus Bookstores</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Oakland, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">referenced a remark by President-elect Joe Biden, predicting a break in Trump Fever and an &#8220;epiphany&#160; &#8230; among many of my Republican friends.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I really hope he doesn&#8217;t believe it, because it&#8217;s not going to happen,&#8221; Coates said in front of a Zoom audience of 1,200, including 500 UC Santa Cruz students, who received free admission and complimentary paperback copies of Coates&#8217;s bestselling 2019 novel, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Water Dancer. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A poll says 70 percent of Republicans think something crooked happened [in the presidential election],&#8221; Coates continued. &#8220;There&#8217;s a market for crazy. And if there&#8217;s a market, why would the fever break?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the subject matter was often fraught, Coates, wearing a stubbled quarantine beard and a gray hooded sweatshirt honoring the late Cuban boxing legend Kid Chocolate, allayed some of the tension with his informal manner and booming laugh.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coates, a National Book Award and MacArthur &#8220;genius&#8221; award honoree, made a name for himself as a fearless journalist and essayist who intenstified and deepened the national conversation about racism in essays including his detailed case for reparations for the horrors of slavery and its legacy in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atlantic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lately he&#8217;s had a lot to say about Biden&#8217;s victory over Donald Trump, and Trump&#8217;s attempt to subvert the results by making false accusations of large-scale voting fraud.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coates chalked it up to racism and attempted disenfranchisement.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People are not fooled by who voted for Biden,&#8221; Coates said, remarking on the large number of African American residents of Philadelphia, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Atlanta who turned out for Biden, only to endure the public spectacle of a defeated candidate trying to undo the results. Coates tied Trump&#8217;s efforts to a broader attempt to delegitimize and destroy the voting rights of Black people in the United States.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You can pick your term,&#8217;&#8217; he said. &#8220;I would say they&#8217;re trying to erase Black people out of the body politic. Others would prefer the term &#8216;coup.'&#8217;&#8217;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>The enduring legacy of slavery</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first glance, the fictional flourishes of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Water Dancer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may seem like departures for Coates, who amassed a large readership during his time as national correspondent at the</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Atlantic,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where he wrote about cultural, social, and political issues, particularly regarding African Americans and white supremacy.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, Coates won the National Book Award for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between the World and Me,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a letter to his then 14-year-old son in which he warned about the perils of being African American. It was highly praised by the late award-winning novelist Toni Morrison, who observed, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been wondering who might fill the intellectual void that plagued me after James Baldwin died &#8230; clearly it is Ta-Nehisi Coates.&#8221; In 2018 the book was adapted and staged at the Apollo Theater, and this year HBO produced a special based on that 2018 staging.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is also the author of the memoir </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Beautiful Struggle,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We Were Eight Years in Power,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a collection of essays about the intense, divided, and emotional response to Barack Obama becoming the country&#8217;s first Black president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Coates&#8217;s Zoom talk with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atlantic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> magazine staff writer Adam Serwer about&#160; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Water Dancer </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was a continuation of his past explorations of racism in America, not a digression from it.&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Water Dancer </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">revisits the familiar subject of racism with a magical flourish, finding a new portal into the material, a technique that will be familiar to admirers of Colson Whitehead&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Underground Railroad,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in which an actual subterranean railroad transports escaping slaves.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The novel tells</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the story of Hiram, a slave who struggles to harness and use a mysterious superpower to help others gain their freedom. The novel is filled with contemporary echoes, with dialogues and events that could have taken place in the 19th century or this year. The book is much more than a gaze toward the past. It also channels history as a way to make sense of the present.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Two siblings, two realities</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serwer asked Coates about the vastly different circumstances of two siblings at the center of the story&#8212;Hiram, who is half African American and half white, and born into slavery, and Maynard, who is a privileged white man and an arrogant fool. Coates noted that most of the violence of slavery took the form of intrafamilial violence&#8212;including sexual violence; Hiram himself is the result of a coercive relationship between a Black woman and a white slaveholder.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiram has a remarkable power called &#8220;Conduction,&#8221; enabling him to transport himself&#160; and others from one place to the other. But he is also constrained by his inability to remember a central event that is most essential to his life.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The protagonist&#8217;s defining strengths and weaknesses have real-life antecedents. Coates referenced the remarkable life of abolitionist and political activist Harriet Tubman, who received such a savage beating that she had blackouts throughout her life.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At any given moment she could faint into a coma,&#8221; Coates said. And yet she led scores of enslaved African Americans to freedom.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main character&#8217;s central act of forgetting also reflects real-life traumas.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think about my mom, who has light brown skin. Her grandmother was very, very fair. She would ask her family, &#8216;Where are the white folks in this family?&#8217; and they&#8217;d say, &#8216;Why do you want to know about that?'</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have a history of not wanting to remember certain things,&#8221; Coates said. &#8220;The country as a whole is imprisoned by its desire not to remember, an inability to face it.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event was part of The Humanities Institute&#8217;s event series focusing on memory, and examining questions such as &#8220;What can memory tell us about the past, present, and future, and why are certain moments remembered while others are silenced and left out?&#8221;</span></i></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fbbf7a5d807270172c1b96bd0726f69e"><name>rhodes-scholar-desai</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz celebrates its first Rhodes Scholar</title><summary>Spring 2020 graduate Garima Desai was named among the top 32 scholars from across the U.S. who will have all of their expenses paid to attend graduate school at Oxford University through a Rhodes Scholarship.</summary><start-date>1606204800000</start-date><display-name>Rhodes Scholar Garima Desai</display-name><path>/2020/11/rhodes-scholar-desai</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/11/rhodes-scholar-desai</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1606246431296</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1614730579728</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Economics</value><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>International</value><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>womens-history</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/11/images/desai-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/11/images/desai-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>desai-350.jpg</name><display-name>desai-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>76662</file-size><width>350</width><height>443</height></image><image-alt>Garima Desai wearing her UC Santa Cruz graduation stole</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/11/images/desai-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/11/images/desai-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>desai-80.jpg</name><display-name>desai-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>22805</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Garima Desai wearing her UC Santa Cruz graduation stole</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garima Desai graduated from UC Santa Cruz this past spring with a double major in environmental studies and economics.

The awards were announced virtually, and Desai was named among the top 32 scholars from across the U.S. who will have all of their expenses paid to attend graduate school at Oxford University. There were more than 2,000 applicants to the program this year.</p>
<p>"When I first found out that I was even a finalist, it was incredible," Desai said. "So finding out that I had won was really surreal."</p>
<p>The reality is slowly sinking in as Desai plans for her future. She graduated from UC Santa Cruz this past spring with a double major in environmental studies and economics, and she'll continue on a similar track at Oxford, where she'll pursue dual master's degrees.</p>
<p>During her time at UC Santa Cruz, Desai was a member of College Nine. She took on many leadership roles, including working as both an undergraduate teaching assistant and a research assistant helping to study elements of urbanization that intersect with climate change. Through those efforts and her coursework, she left a lasting impression on many of her professors.</p>
<p>"I've had about 100 students take my environmental economics course over the last four years, and Garima was by far the highest-scoring student," said Jeremy West, an assistant professor of economics. "She also has incredible poise. It's one thing to be brilliant and academically gifted, but it's another to be able to communicate well and convey your insights."</p>
<p>West was among a group of UC Santa Cruz faculty who supported Desai's Rhodes Scholar application by writing letters of recommendation and helping her with interview practice. Adam Millard-Ball, an associate professor of environmental studies, was also among that group. He's been a mentor to Desai for several years and has come to know the strength of her character.</p>
<p>"She's genuinely giving and humble, and I've seen that both in classes and when she's teaching or in a lab group setting," said Millard-Ball. "In her time here at UC Santa Cruz, she did a lot to help other people succeed. Garima is a great inspiration that all of our students, in different ways, can push the boundaries and go to places that are new territory for UCSC grads."</p>
<p>Desai credits her time at UC Santa Cruz for opening her eyes to a wide variety of strategies for creating change on environmental issues. Since graduating, she's been working as a transportation planner in Oakland, a role she never would have imagined four years ago.</p>
<p>"When you think of an environmentalist, you don't necessarily think of a transportation planner," she said. "But I'm interested in urbanization, because the way we build our cities is long term, and it has an impact on carbon emissions. I'm also interested in how we can use the incredible tools of economics to create groundbreaking policies."</p>
<p>Desai said Millard-Ball's mentorship helped her find the confidence to dream big as she pursues these interests.</p>
<p>"He saw potential in me that I didn't know I had," she said. "He was the one who told me 'you are academically excellent'. I never really believed it until he told me."</p>
<p>Both Garima Desai and her older sister, Mansi (Stevenson '16, linguistics; M.A. '18, linguistics), attended UC Santa Cruz. Their degrees are now displayed proudly in the family home of their mother, Hetal, and father, Pranav. The whole family couldn't be more thrilled for Garima, and they're grateful to her professors for the role they played in supporting her over the years.</p>
<p>"Parents always believe in their child," said Hetal Desai, "but when the professors and the university believe in them, it makes a brighter future for all the students."</p>
<p>As Garima Desai embarks on her next chapter, she'll carry with her the spiritual teachings of her ashram, where she first learned the practice of <em>seva,</em> or providing service for the world, which has inspired her environmental activism. And now, as a Rhodes Scholar, she'll pair that deep motivation with a newfound confidence that nothing is out of reach.</p>
<p>"I've learned that, even if it feels like there's not a path carved out for you, you can carve your own path and set your own destination," she said. "If you truly believe in what you're doing, even if no one has done it before, you can do it."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fbc28989807270172c1b96bd986d4c06"><name>giving-thanks-as-the-holidays-near</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Giving thanks as the holidays near</title><summary>As the holiday season approaches, I want to extend my very best wishes to all in our campus community.&#13;

<p>As the holiday season approaches, I want to extend my very best wishes to all in our campus community.<br/><br/>To our students, I am thankful for your patience, optimism and resolve over the past eight months. Remote instruction can be trying, and it&#8217;s not what any of us envisioned our future would hold when the holidays descended upon us a year ago. But you have shown us all that Banana Slugs are not easily daunted. We have found new ways to create community. We are a special university, and it&#8217;s the people, not just the place, who make it special.<br/><br/>To our staff and faculty, I am deeply grateful for the work you do, and have done throughout 2020, keeping our university operation humming along in the face of significant obstacles. It is no small feat to teach our thousands of students, to house and feed hundreds of them daily, and to maintain a rigorous research operation, all while battling a global pandemic. Yet that is exactly what we have done, and I want to say thanks to all of you for your hard work and resilience.<br/><br/>I offer special thanks to our essential workers &#8212; our housing and dining staffers, our Student Health Center workers, our campus police officers, our bus drivers and custodians, to name just a few. Your work is seen by far fewer people right now, but your efforts are deeply appreciated by me and so many others.<br/><br/>I am also thankful that our campus COVID-19 case numbers have remained relatively low. That tells me that our campus community members have prioritized the well-being of others. I am buoyed by that. While it looks as if a vaccine will soon be available, caseloads are again spiking across the country. We must not let our optimism overtake our vigilance.<br/><br/>For so many of us, the holidays are a time when families and friends come together. This year poses an obvious challenge in that regard. It will be hard for families, particularly those spread over a great distance, to assemble. And even those who are nearby may be hesitant to gather in the ways they have previously. This past week, our county&#8217;s COVID status was moved back to purple, which is the most restrictive tier. Much of California faces similar restrictions.<br/><br/>Now is a good time to re-evaluate our plans for gathering with loved ones. Please <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/11/holiday-travel-and-guidance.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">read&#160;the campus message on holiday travel</a>. Remember that every choice we make will have impacts on our family and friends, including those on campus.<br/><br/>Wishing you all a restful and restorative fall-quarter recess.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>In an effort to support the community&#8217;s health and well-being and forge a responsible path forward, UC Santa Cruz is launching a public awareness campaign to remind students, faculty, and staff to <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/covidtest/">get a COVID&#8211;19 test regularly</a> as part of its asymptomatic testing program.</p>
<p>Called &#8220;TestMe,&#8221; the campaign strives to communicate that the test is easy (self-administered) and free. UC Santa Cruz encourages everyone to share information about the testing program with their colleagues and students. <a href="https://communications.ucsc.edu/visual-design/zoom/">Zoom backgrounds</a> are a great way to help get the message out.</p>
<p>The campaign is aimed at students on campus and in the community, as well as staff and faculty who work on campus or who come to campus periodically for work. The current testing requirements and recommendations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students on campus are required to do mandatory weekly testing twice a week;</li>
<li>Students who live off campus and live-in residential staff may receive a test up to twice a week on a voluntary basis;</li>
<li>Faculty and staff who are teaching, holding meetings, and other activities on campus may receive up to one test a week on a voluntary basis;</li>
</ul>
<p>Current campus testing locations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Merrill Cultural Center in Merrill College</li>
<li>Namaste Student Lounge at College Nine</li>
<li>George P. Hitchcock Lounge in the Porter College C building</li>
</ul>
<p>The pandemic world changes quickly, and as a result so will the campus testing requirements and protocols. Stay up to date by checking recovery.ucsc.edu.</p>
<p>To schedule an appointment for a COVID test now, visit ucsc.edu/covidtest or call the UC Santa Cruz Student Health Center at (831) 459&#8211;2591.</p>
<p>Students who are showing symptoms of COVID-19 should <a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/about/contact.html">call the Student Health Center,</a> and employees with symptoms should call their primary care provider. Anyone with symptoms <strong>should not</strong> go to an asymptomatic testing site.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1a2b5468807270172c1b96bd4d9d77c3"><name>exceptions-to-campus-closure</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Exceptions to campus closure 2020-2021</title><summary>This year the campus will be closed from Thursday, December 24, 2020 through Sunday, January 3, 2021, re-opening on Monday, January 4, 2021.

This year the campus will be closed from Thursday, December 24, 2020 through Sunday, January 3, 2021, re-opening on Monday, January 4, 2021. The campus community is reminded to turn off lights, shut down computers and other office equipment, and close and lock exterior windows before leaving for the break.<br/><br/>During the closure some housing areas and other buildings will remain open. Laboratory buildings will be partially operational due to special needs of researchers and scientists, and some campus units' work schedules may require staffing during all or part of the closure. Fire, police, and environmental health and safety services will be provided to the campus community during this period, along with necessary utilities and other essential services.<br/><br/>If you are required to work all or part of this closure on campus, you must receive approval from your unit head and principal officer. Once unit heads have concurrence from their principal officer, they are asked to notify Physical Plant directly of their plans to remain open or staffed during part or all of the closure on campus. Notifications should be made via email to <a href="mailto:allysonr@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">allysonr@ucsc.edu</a> no later than Friday, December 11, 2020, and should include the specific dates that offices will be occupied, as well as the number of occupants. This will ensure that open areas will receive necessary services during this period when most faculty, staff, and students are gone.<br/><br/>It is important to note, however, that building temperatures in underutilized areas will generally be reduced. Therefore, please advise staff to dress appropriately during this time. Faculty is urged to announce the closure broadly to their graduate students who may plan on working throughout the closures.<br/><br/>If you have facilities-related questions or would like further information on campus closure exceptions, please contact Allyson Raedeke at (831) 515-9483.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Staff and Faculty</audience><admin>Jim Kari, Director of Physical Plant Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1b149839807270172c1b96bd28de68cb"><name>igem-gold</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC iGEM team wins gold, nominated for best environmental project </title><summary>Thirteen undergraduates were recognized for their research accomplishments at the world’s largest competition in synthetic biology.</summary><start-date>1606723200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC iGEM team wins gold, nominated for best environmental project </display-name><path>/2020/11/igem-gold</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/11/igem-gold</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1606772103198</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1606846216012</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Social Consciousness</value><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Rose Miyatsu</name><title></title><phone/><email>rmiyatsu@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/11/images/sophia-faith-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/11/images/sophia-faith-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sophia-faith-410.jpg</name><display-name>sophia-faith-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>209980</file-size><width>410</width><height>296</height></image><image-alt>Sophia Sneddon and Faith Williams</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/11/images/kyra-rachel-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/11/images/kyra-rachel-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kyra-rachel-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>kyra-rachel-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>36288</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Kyra Eyerman</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Covid-19 and wildfires made lab work especially challenging for the students on this year&#8217;s iGEM team.

At the conclusion of judging on Sunday, their project to <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/10/igem-team.html"><span color="#1155cc" style="color: #1155cc;"><u>create a biodegradable agricultural plastic out of cellulose</u></span></a> was awarded a gold medal and nominated as one of the best environmental projects in the competition.</p>
<p>The iGEM competition, which is normally held in Boston, was entirely online this year, but the team was still able to network with other researchers.</p>
<p>&#8220;iGEM made a lot of workshops and created different ways to connect with other teams around the world without having to meet face to face,&#8221; said Melody Azimi, one of the UCSC team&#8217;s co-captains. &#8220;It was so interesting to see how different parts of the world approached research during COVID-19.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judges evaluated teams&#8217; virtual posters, wiki pages, and video presentations against a long list of criteria and placed them in bronze, silver, and gold medal tiers. Gold medals were reserved only for teams that had &#8220;shown excellence in multiple areas&#8221; and upheld the key iGEM pillars of engineering success, collaboration, and human practices.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s gold medal is a first for UC Santa Cruz, and co-captain Sophia Sneddon is thrilled that her team was able to pull it off in spite of the immense challenges presented by 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so proud of our team for earning gold during the year of the COVID-19 pandemic and historic wildfires in our town,&#8221; Sneddon said. &#8220;It was the hardest year to do iGEM, but we are the first UCSC team to earn a gold medal. I'm sure that there will be more UCSC golds in the upcoming years!&#8221;</p>
<p>The team was mentored this year by David Bernick, assistant adjunct professor of biomolecular engineering at the Baskin School of Engineering, and by former UCSC iGEM member and current UCSC graduate student Ryan Modlin. Bernick has overseen multiple iGEM research projects over the years, and is proud of what the students are able to accomplish in less than a year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, iGEM is a program to inspire and train scientist-engineers to truly understand a real-world problem where we can make a real difference,&#8221; Bernick said. &#8220;This program is made for UCSC&#8212;we care, we listen, we respond ... repeat. Fiat Slug.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 2020 team includes co-captains Sneddon and Azimi as well as team members Alicia Jorgenson, Conor Kensok, Faith Williams, Gabriel Sanchez Jr., Joshua Elkins, Neil Smith, Taylor Ziccardi, Claudia Paz Flores, Kyra Eyerman, Navdeep Kalkat, and Rachel Mace.</p>
<p>A majority of the team members are seniors in either biomolecular engineering and bioinformatics or molecular, cell, and developmental biology. Although they are preparing to finish their degrees in the midst of great global uncertainty, Sneddon believes that their tenacity has shown that they are prepared for whatever the world throws at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know from witnessing their resilience that our group of students will go on to be impactful in whatever careers they choose,&#8221; she said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1bd4db08807270172c1b96bd7836cd67"><name>healing-words-magazine</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Erick Melara: Healing words</title><summary>Medical student Erick Melara (Cowell ’15, human biology) hosts Behind the White Coat, a podcast highlighting underrepresented and low-income people in the medical field.</summary><start-date>1606723200000</start-date><display-name>Healing words</display-name><path>/2020/11/healing-words-magazine</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/11/healing-words-magazine</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1606784703217</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1606784808159</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text/><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/11/images/erick-melara-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/11/images/erick-melara-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>erick-melara-featured.jpg</name><display-name>erick-melara-featured.jpg</display-name><file-size>7441</file-size><width>400</width><height>190</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Erick Melara</thumb-alt><title>Erick Melara: Healing words</title><description>Medical student Erick Melara (Cowell ’15, human biology) hosts Behind the White Coat, a podcast highlighting underrepresented and low-income people in the medical field.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1bd8902d807270172c1b96bdcda5bf5d"><name>reciprocity-in-conversation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Psychology research shows ‘water cooler talk’ can have big benefits</title><summary>In settings where people are working together on a task, making time for small talk allows for a newly-described behavior called "reciprocity in conversation," which is associated with higher levels of task enjoyment. &#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This corrective behavior had never before been identified or described. The researchers at UC Santa Cruz who discovered it are calling it &#8220;reciprocity in conversation.&#8221; And in settings where people are working together on a task, it&#8217;s actually associated with higher levels of task enjoyment. This could have fascinating implications for employee morale in work settings, but there&#8217;s a catch. In order for conversation reciprocity to take place, the people collaborating on a task must make time to incorporate small talk into their work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Guydish, a Ph.D. student in cognitive psychology and lead author on this research, said the findings couldn&#8217;t have come at a better time, because they may be able to help improve remote work environments.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;An average workday now is getting the team together into a virtual meeting, where there&#8217;s a very clear goal and task,&#8221; Guydish said. &#8220;You&#8217;re not talking to coworkers at their desk or in the hall. Everything is structured, and everything is essentially a task nowadays. So this research highlights the importance of perhaps trying to institute moments throughout the day with unstructured chat time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s in those moments that reciprocity works its magic. Typically, when peers are working together on a task that requires one to direct the other, it creates a natural imbalance in the conversation, where the person in the leadership role ends up doing most of the talking. But if the participants also have unstructured time available, the person leading the task-based conversation can use the opportunity to pull back on their contributions, essentially yielding air time during small talk to the other participant.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s reciprocity. It helps balance the scales of the overall interaction. And the closer participants get to achieving balance, the higher their levels of enjoyment will be related to the task at hand.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make this discovery, the research team&#8212;which included Guydish, psychology professor Jean Fox Tree, and anticipated 2021 Ph.D. graduate Trevor D&#8217;Arcey&#8212;analyzed an open-source UC Santa Cruz dataset called the Artwalk Corpus. It&#8217;s a collection of transcripts from an experiment where one person in a lab was connected with another via video call and tasked with directing them on a walk around downtown Santa Cruz to find and photograph public art.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers reviewed the transcripts from 69 artwalk conversations to identify both task-based and &#8220;off-task&#8221; communications. Then they determined the contribution balance of each participant, based on who said more words or took longer speaking turns, for each type of communication. In comparing the two, they discovered reciprocity. And when they reviewed the results of post-participation surveys, they found that more balanced conversations, with high levels of reciprocity, had higher reported levels of task enjoyment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These findings add a new dimension to psychologists&#8217; understanding of the importance of balanced communications in collaborative settings. Prior research by Professor Jean Fox Tree, who specializes in psycholinguistics, has also shown that conversational imbalances can have negative effects on task performance by limiting feedback and engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To understand this, you could draw an analogy to a classroom,&#8221; said Fox Tree. &#8220;Getting feedback from the class tells the professor how they should be explaining something, and that helps everyone in the class, not just the one person who&#8217;s asking the question.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the most effective strategies for achieving these benefits are not always intuitive. Prior research on task-based communications found that if roles and power dynamics are merely rotated during a task, the person originally assigned the leadership role often carries forward a tendency to dominate the conversation. Reciprocity shows that the way to bring balance in teamwork settings may not be switching roles, but rather removing the roles entirely and making time to just connect on a personal level.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-author Trevor D&#8217;Arcey said he thinks this research shows that people are &#8220;generally trying to be considerate of each other.&#8221;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There may just be something about small talk that gives us a boost in the right direction.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="68cd0d93807270172c1b96bd14503607"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1685125864959</last-published-on><last-published-by>asoergel</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2020/11/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/11/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1612371004803</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1612371004803</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="68cd0d93807270172c1b96bd14503607"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1685125864959</last-published-on><last-published-by>asoergel</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2020/11/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/11/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1612371004803</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1612371004803</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
