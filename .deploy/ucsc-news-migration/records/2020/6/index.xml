An activist, he was killed during the 2019 protests in Chile. Yet, as part of a team of UC Santa Cruz students researching the demonstrations, which erupted over cost-of-living increases and economic equalities, Estrada said she will always feel a connection to him.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While at UC Santa Cruz, the legal studies major was part of an open-source research project undertaken by the campus&#8217;s Human Rights Investigations Lab for the Americas done in collaboration with UC Berkeley&#8217;s lab. Estrada&#8217;s role was to create a story map detailing the life and death of a single young activist using his social media posts and comparing them with news reports at the time.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result is a report that is expected to be published in the coming months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Estrada, now 23, the research was a chance to learn first-hand the importance of social media in the modern world of revolution and reform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I saw how closely tethered an activist is to social media,&#8221; Estrada said. &#8220;I realized how social media has changed activism, and how important it is to have a platform to speak from. Through an activist&#8217;s social media presence, you can look through the cracks (in government and media reporting) and see what else is going on.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A first-generation college student from Orange County, Estrada also spent three months interning at New America, a Washington, D.C., think tank devoted to addressing social, economic, and political problems. There, she helped produce a report on citizen engagement in local democracies across the Americas and Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She hopes graduate school or law school is in her future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the Human Rights Investigations Lab, Estrada said, she found a way to contribute to society and effect change even while studying and working part-time to support herself. She was inspired, she said, by people, including those ones who came before her, who are working for justice, especially for undocumented immigrants.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she prepared a timeline of the activist&#8217;s life and death, she said she was struck by the fact he wasn&#8217;t much older than she was and that he&#8217;d experienced some of the same life events she had before he died.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And even though I will never meet him or some of the other activists who made those changes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I feel connected to them in many ways. I feel part of a transnational community to continue social justice work.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7079e20e8072701763b3cba6a3dbb6d6"><name>coastal-defenses</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Two vital buffers against climate change are just offshore</title><summary>A new study underscores the need to conserve and restore mangroves and coral reefs for coastal protection.</summary><keywords>Erika Zavaleta, Holly Jones</keywords><start-date>1590994800000</start-date><display-name>Two vital buffers against climate change are just offshore</display-name><path>/2020/06/coastal-defenses</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/06/coastal-defenses</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1591024935409</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1591025225518</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tom Parisi (NIU) &amp; Tim Stephens (UCSC)</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/06/images/mangroves-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/06/images/mangroves-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mangroves-400.jpg</name><display-name>mangroves-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>182103</file-size><width>400</width><height>246</height></image><image-alt>mangroves</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/06/images/mangroves-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/06/images/mangroves-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mangroves-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>mangroves-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>34075</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>mangroves</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Mangroves (above) and coral reefs (below) provide valuable protection for coastlines around the globe.

In some of those regions, however, powerful defenses are located just offshore.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Existing mangroves and coral reefs provide key buffers that could help cushion the blow against future tropical storms and rising waters for about 8.5 million people, according to the study published </span></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;"><span>May 29</span></span></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;"> in the journal </span></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;"><i>PLOS ONE</i></span></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Because the two &#8220;natural infrastructures&#8221; absorb wave energy, reduce wave heights and provide a host of other environmental benefits, the study findings underscore the need for</span></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">worldwide conservation and restoration of these natural resources. A particular focus, the authors said, should be placed on the most vulnerable regions, which lack available resources for more expensive protective measures, such as construction of levees or sea walls.</span></span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Simply put, it&#8217;s much cheaper to conserve a mangrove than to build a sea wall,&#8221; said lead author Holly Jones of Northern Illinois University. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Jones</span></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;"><span>, who holds a joint appointment at NIU in biological sciences and environmental studies</span></span></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">, did much of the work on the study at UC Santa Cruz, where she was a postdoctoral fellow working with coauthors Barry Nickel, director of the UCSC Center for Integrated Spatial Research, and Erika Zavaleta, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. </span></span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">This is an important example of an opportunity to advance multiple goals in synergy,&#8221; Zavaleta said. &#8220;Conserving coral reefs and mangroves can protect coastal communities from storms and sea-level rise, store carbon to mitigate climate change, and conserve biodiversity.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">A 100-meter-wide coastal strip of mangroves can reduce wave heights by as much as two-thirds, the scientists said. Coral reefs meanwhile buffer wave energy by up to 97% in some contexts, significantly reducing erosion and cutting flood-damage costs in half annually.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span>&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Coral reefs and mangroves serve as cost-efficient buffers against the adverse impacts of climate change, and they already play important roles in protecting human lives and livelihoods, while providing a multitude of biodiversity benefits,&#8221; said Jones, a UCSC alumna who earned her B.S. in ecology and evolutionary biology/marine biology in 2003. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">In addition to Jones, Nickel,&#160;</span></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">and</span></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;"> Zavaleta</span></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">, the coauthors of the study include Tanja Srebotnjak of </span></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California, and Will Turner, Mariano Gonzalez-Roglich and David G. Hole of Conservation International in Arlington, Virginia. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;"><strong>The &#8216;most vulnerable&#8217;<!-- I did some reorganizing and rewriting in this section. --></strong></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">The study aimed to identify highly vulnerable coastal regions that would benefit most from &#8220;ecosystem-based adaptation,&#8221; or using conservation, restoration, and sustainable management of existing ecosystems to address climate impacts.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Regions meeting study criteria for &#8220;highly vulnerable&#8221; were within two miles of coastline and scored in the top 10th percentile of the authors&#8217; vulnerability index for being highly exposed to the effects of tropical storms or sea-level rise, dense in population, and low in &#8220;adaptive capacity.&#8221; The authors developed the adaptive-capacity measure to take into account economic data, education levels, and other factors that play into a region&#8217;s ability to adjust to climate variability. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">The authors found that 30.9 million people globally live in regions that are most vulnerable to tropical storms and projected sea-level rise. </span></span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Our estimate is very conservative,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;This population lives in regions in the top 10th percentile for vulnerability. If we apply our model to coastal regions that scored in the top half for vulnerability, the population soars to 700,000 million people.&#8221; </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Highly vulnerable, coastal regions that would benefit the most from the conservation of mangroves and coral reefs span across Central America, the Caribbean, Eastern Africa, Southeast Asia, and the South Pacific region. And</span></span></span><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;"> yet only 38% of mangroves and 11% of coral reefs located along the most vulnerable coastlines are protected, according to the study.</span></span></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">The authors noted that many of the world&#8217;s coastal zones already bear the brunt of extreme weather. Events such as Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas and Hurricanes Maria, Harvey and Irma in the United States and the Caribbean claimed thousands of lives and generated financial costs running into hundreds of billions of dollars. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Additionally, past research indicates loss of lives and assets in coastal zones are likely to increase significantly as a result of demographic and socio-economic trends alone, leading to a doubling or more of hurricane damages by 2100. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;"><strong>U.S. could benefit, too</strong></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Coastlines in Florida and the U.S. island territories of Puerto Rico and Guam also stand to benefit from mangrove and coral reef conservation and restoration. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Globally, the densest populations receiving adaptation benefits from mangroves (people protected per hectare) are in India, the United States, and Ghana, the study found. The largest numbers of people protected per hectare of coral reefs are in South Africa, Singapore, China, and the United States.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">More than a billion coastal dwellers worldwide face some degree of vulnerability to climate change. While most coastal regions are outside of tropical zones and aren&#8217;t buffered by mangroves or coral reefs, other ecosystems such as wetlands, estuaries and seagrasses provide similar protective benefits, Jones said.</span></span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">The United States is a wealthy country and has more ability to adapt than other countries, but it still could see significant benefits from conservation and restoration of existing natural infrastructure,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;Coastal ecosystems reduce the proportion of vulnerable people and infrastructure along exposed U.S. coastlines by around half through their absorption of wave energy.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">The study authors also pointed to other benefits of natural infrastructures, which provide habitats for a host of marine and terrestrial animals and create recreation and tourism opportunities. In the most vulnerable coastal regions alone, mangroves store at least 896 million metric tons of carbon.</span></span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;"><span>Ensuring the resiliency of mangroves is a win-win-win for people, nature, and the climate,&#8221; said coauthor Dave Hole, senior director at Conservation International&#8217;s Betty and Gordon Moore Center for Science. &#8220;Mangroves store more carbon than any other forest ecosystem on Earth, drawing carbon dioxide down from the atmosphere and storing it for decades, and so helping slow global warming.&#8221; </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Next step: site-specific studies</strong></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">The authors noted that their global study provides &#8220;a coarse approximation&#8221; of threats and of regions of the world that might benefit most from ecosystem-based adaptation. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Despite mounting interest in ecosystem-based adaptation, implementation has mostly been in the form of site-specific projects. What&#8217;s needed next, the authors said, is systematic assessment of the broader potential, analyses of the ways in which ecosystem protection varies from site to site, and further investment in conservation and restoration. </span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has always enjoyed playing video games and counts as her all-time favorite the Pok&#233;mon Mystery Dungeon series. She currently loves </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Animal Crossing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.&#160;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For her, a great video game is one that is well designed with mechanics that are structured around the narrative.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everything has meaning and everything is well thought out,&#8221; said Dupuis, who is currently looking for a job in the video game industry.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dupuis, 22, grew up in Antioch where she attended the performing arts academy at Deer Valley High School. She plays five instruments: piano, guitar, ukulele, violin, and harmonica. She performed in her school&#8217;s show choir, singing and dancing at competitions at Disneyland every year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has played golf since age 8 and was playing on the UC Santa Cruz golf team through her junior year (she stopped playing this year to focus more on her career).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everybody in my family plays golf,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We all go out on the weekends and play golf together.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dupuis is so serious about her academics that she took on two capstone projects, one in computer science and one in game design&#8212;an unusual feat.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one she is working on now is her game design project. She is the producer, which involves managing her 14-member team&#8217;s schedules, scheduling with professors, running meetings, and doing networking. The game is the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trials of Tonalli,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an Aztec-inspired four-person game where four demigods work to save the world. She has enjoyed working with the team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everyone&#8217;s really responsive, and we have a very strict schedule we abide by to keep track of everything,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the state lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all the work has been done remotely with Dupuis doing her part from her family&#8217;s home in Discovery Bay.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, she is grateful for her experience at UC Santa Cruz. Coming from a conservative background, she learned a lot and experienced personal growth attending a more liberal school.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I definitely don&#8217;t think I would have the opportunities or connections I have right now, if I didn&#8217;t go to UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It taught me a lot about who I am and who I want to be.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="713e4cc68072701763b3cba6adcd7d75"><name>crab-nebula</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Detection of Crab Nebula shows viability of innovative gamma-ray telescope</title><summary> A new prototype telescope opens doors for future discoveries at the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array.</summary><keywords>David Williams</keywords><start-date>1590994800000</start-date><display-name>Detection of Crab Nebula shows viability of innovative gamma-ray telescope</display-name><path>/2020/06/crab-nebula</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/06/crab-nebula</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1591037807784</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1591038221377</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/06/images/crab-nebula-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/06/images/crab-nebula-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>crab-nebula-400.jpg</name><display-name>crab-nebula-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>139322</file-size><width>400</width><height>401</height></image><image-alt>crab nebula detection</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/06/images/crab-nebula-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/06/images/crab-nebula-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>crab-nebula-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>crab-nebula-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25829</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>crab nebula detection</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Detection of the Crab Nebula demonstrated the viability of a novel gamma-ray telescope technology.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/06/images/psct-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/06/images/psct-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>psct-400.jpg</name><display-name>psct-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>134246</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>pSCT telescope</image-alt><image-caption><span>The&#160;prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (pSCT) is a novel type of gamma-ray telescope designed for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).

The results were announced June 1 at the 236th meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS).</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">For fifty years, the optical design of gamma-ray telescopes has been essentially unchanged. With this detection, we have verified a new, more sophisticated optical design that not only gives enormously better optical performance, but enables the camera to take full advantage of modern developments in light sensors and high-speed electronics,&#8221; said David Williams, a researcher in the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) and adjunct professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Williams is a co-principal investigator on the grant from the National Science Foundation that supported construction of the telescope. His group at UCSC, including several undergraduate students, tested light sensors to select the best model to use in the telescope camera and to calibrate the performance of the sensors purchased for the camera.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The Crab Nebula is the brightest steady source of very-high-energy gamma rays in the sky, so detecting it is an excellent way of proving the pSCT technology. &#8220;Very-high-energy gamma rays are the highest energy photons in the universe and can unveil the physics of extreme objects including black holes and possibly dark matter,&#8221; said Justin Vandenbroucke of the University of Wisconsin.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Detecting the Crab Nebula with the pSCT is more than just proof-positive for the telescope itself. It lays the groundwork for the future of gamma-ray astrophysics. &#8220;We&#8217;ve established this new technology, which will measure gamma-rays with extraordinary precision, enabling future discoveries,&#8221; said Vandenbroucke. &#8220;Gamma-ray astronomy is already at the heart of the new multi-messenger astrophysics, and the SCT technology will make it an even more important player.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The use of secondary mirrors in gamma-ray telescopes is a leap forward in innovation for the relatively young field of very-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy, which has moved rapidly to the forefront of astrophysics. &#8220;Just over three decades ago, TeV gamma rays were first detected in the universe, from the Crab Nebula, on the same mountain where the pSCT sits today,&#8221; said Vandenbroucke. &#8220;That was a real breakthrough, opening a cosmic window with light that is a trillion times more energetic than we can see with our eyes. Today, we&#8217;re using two mirror surfaces instead of one, and state-of-the-art sensors and electronics to study these gamma rays with exquisite resolution.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The initial pSCT Crab Nebula detection was made possible by leveraging key simultaneous observations with the co-located VERITAS (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System) observatory.&#160; &#8220;We have successfully evolved the way gamma-ray astronomy has been done during the past 50 years, enabling studies to be performed in much less time,&#8221; said VERITAS Director Wystan Benbow. &#8220;Several future programs will particularly benefit, including surveys of the gamma-ray sky, studies of large objects like supernova remnants, and searches for multi-messenger counterparts to astrophysical neutrinos and gravitational wave events.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Amado, Arizona&#8212;the largest field site of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian&#8212;the pSCT was inaugurated in January 2019 and saw first light the same week. After a year of commissioning work, scientists began observing the Crab Nebula in January 2020, but the project has been underway for more than a decade.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">We first proposed the idea of applying this optical system to TeV gamma-ray astronomy nearly 15 years ago, and my colleagues and I built a team in the US and internationally to prove that this technology could work,&#8221; said pSCT principal investigator Vladimir Vassiliev. &#8220;What was once a theoretical limit to this technology is now well within our grasp, and continued improvements to the technology and the electronics will further increase our capability to detect gamma rays at resolutions and rates we once only ever dreamed of.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The pSCT was made possible by the contributions of thirty institutions and five critical industry partners across the United States, Italy, Germany, Japan, and Mexico, and by funding through the U.S National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation Program.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">That a prototype of a future facility can yield such a tantalizing result promises great things from the full capability, and exemplifies NSF's interest in creating new possibilities that can enable a project to attract wide-spread support,&#8221; said NSF program manager Nigel Sharp.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Now demonstrated, the pSCT&#8217;s current and upcoming innovations will lay the groundwork for use in the future Cherenkov Telescope Array observatory, which will host more than 100 gamma-ray telescopes. &#8220;The pSCT, and its innovations, are pathfinding for the future CTA, which will detect gamma-ray sources at around 100 times faster than VERITAS, which is the current state of the art,&#8221; said Benbow. &#8220;We have demonstrated that this new technology for gamma-ray astronomy unequivocally works. The promise is there for this groundbreaking new observatory, and it opens a tremendous amount of discovery potential.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7146e4f08072701763b3cba66aa9414e"><name>nanomagnets</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New optical technique provides more efficient probe of nanomagnet dynamics</title><summary>Data storage devices and other emerging technologies use magnetic elements smaller than 100 nanometers, but studying their magnetization dynamics can be a challenge.</summary><keywords>Holger Schmidt</keywords><start-date>1590994800000</start-date><display-name>New optical technique provides more efficient probe of nanomagnet dynamics</display-name><path>/2020/06/nanomagnets</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/06/nanomagnets</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1591038371030</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1591038590687</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/06/images/cover-crop-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/06/images/cover-crop-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-crop-410.jpg</name><display-name>cover-crop-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>72541</file-size><width>410</width><height>287</height></image><image-alt>nanomagnet analysis diagram</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/06/images/cover-crop-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/06/images/cover-crop-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-crop-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cover-crop-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24577</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>nanomagnet diagram</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Optical analysis of nanomagnets is achieved by directing a laser pulse at gratings designed to generate surface acoustic waves and focus the vibrational energy of the waves on individual nanomagnets.

Researchers at UC Santa Cruz have developed a new optical technique that enables efficient analysis of single nanomagnets as small as 75 nanometers in diameter, enabling them to extract critical information for optimizing device performance. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">It&#8217;s a much more efficient method to get critical device parameters for magnetic memory and other applications,&#8221; said electrical engineer Holger Schmidt, the Kapany Professor of Optoelectronics at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Schmidt and first author Wei-Gang Yang, a postdoctoral researcher in his lab, reported their results in a </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0006461"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">paper</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> published in </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Applied Physics Letters</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> as the cover article of the May 26 issue. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The traditional optical technique Schmidt&#8217;s lab has employed to study these materials uses a short laser pulse to knock the nanomagnet out of its equilibrium state, which allows researchers to extract information about the magnet&#8217;s properties as it returns to its normal state. With smaller nanomagnets, however, this approach becomes very inefficient as the optical signal is reduced and more difficult to pick up. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In the new approach, instead of directly exciting the nanomagnet, the laser pulse shines on an array of tiny bars that form a grating, causing them to vibrate and generate waves in the material called surface acoustic waves. By designing gratings with curved bars, Yang and Schmidt were able to focus the vibrational energy of the waves to converge on the location of the nanomagnet. The surface acoustic waves drive magnetic oscillations in the nanomagnet at the same frequency as the waves. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">With the same laser power, we can now get ten times more signal, allowing us to see much smaller nanomagnets,&#8221; Schmidt said. &#8220;We were able to go down to 75 nanometers, which is much more relevant to the scale of nanomagnets that are being used in devices.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The researchers also developed a grating design that generates waves in four different directions and at different frequencies from a single optical pulse, enabling them to excite the magnetization dynamics of four individual nanomagnets at different frequencies, ranging from 7 to 10 gigahertz. Nanomagnetic oscillators are important components in many emerging &#8220;spintronic&#8221; technologies. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">This is an interesting way to get these microwave oscillations going, and it&#8217;s something we&#8217;d like to pursue further,&#8221; Schmidt said. </span></p>

This survey was administered by UC San Diego at no cost to our campus. The goal of the survey was to learn about your experiences during COVID-19 and identify what our campus can do better to support you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, we received the </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LvFKEDt3nPqyZ-gMUdL48ChrveJhTV6b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">results of the survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We had 1,593 surveys submitted, which is a 32% response rate with a 2% margin of error. We had 355 faculty and 1,238 staff responses. In addition to the survey summary report, we also received all the open response comments in an anonymous format not tied to the email of the person submitting the survey. These results have been shared with two of our COVID-19 work groups that are focused on community, morale, and employee resilience. They will review the responses to better inform their recommendations. Additional outreach to employees will take place throughout that process as recommendations are developed and we assess whether we are making progress in areas identified as needing improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I appreciate the time so many of you took to share your thoughts. This is important feedback to hear as we work to improve our support during our COVID-19 recovery and resiliency planning.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Faculty and Staff</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="76224d4f8072701763b3cba61aea7f25"><name>kathryn-sullivan</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumna Kathy Sullivan embarks on another first, this time to the ocean’s depths</title><summary>The first American woman to walk in space, Sullivan is now aiming to be the first woman to visit the deepest spot in the oceans.</summary><start-date>1591081200000</start-date><display-name>Alumna Kathy Sullivan embarks on another first, this time to the ocean’s depths</display-name><path>/2020/06/kathryn-sullivan</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/06/kathryn-sullivan</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1591119858993</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1591976586550</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/06/images/kathryn-sullivan-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/06/images/kathryn-sullivan-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kathryn-sullivan-300.jpg</name><display-name>kathryn-sullivan-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>71949</file-size><width>300</width><height>377</height></image><image-alt>Kathryn Sullivan</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/06/images/kathryn-sullivan-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/06/images/kathryn-sullivan-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kathryn-sullivan-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>kathryn-sullivan-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24917</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Kathryn Sullivan</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Kathryn Sullivan (Photo by Stephen Voss for <em>Time</em>)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>The first American woman to walk in space, Sullivan is now aiming to be the first woman to visit the deepest spot in the oceans</article-subhead><article-text><p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">UCSC alumna Kathryn Sullivan, a former astronaut who was the first American woman to walk in space and later served as the administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is poised to become the first woman and only the fifth person in history to descend to the deepest spot in the world&#8217;s oceans, the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, seven miles below the surface of the Pacific Ocean.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Sullivan will make her descent in the </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Limiting Factor</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, a two-person submersible designed and built by Triton Submarines, as part of </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="https://caladanoceanic.com/expeditions/ringoffire/"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Caladan Oceanic&#8217;s Ring of Fire Expedition</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> led by investor and explorer Victor Vescovo, who will pilot the submersible. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Sullivan&#8217;s Challenger Deep dive is currently scheduled for June 7. She is joining the expedition in Guam, where the team is scheduled to set sail on the deep submergence support vessel </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Pressure Drop</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span> on June 5.

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Plans for the expedition include a series of dives in the Mariana Trench, where the team hopes to observe volcanic vents, identify new species, and conduct extensive mapping of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone at the request of NOAA.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Sullivan graduated from UCSC in 1973 with a bachelor's degree in Earth sciences. Gary Griggs, a distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences whose oceanography class sparked Sullivan&#8217;s interest in science, called her achievements inspirational.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">If you have one student like Kathy Sullivan in your entire teaching career, you would be fortunate,&#8221; Griggs said. &#8220;Kathy is an extraordinary person who has achieved remarkable things that the rest of us may only dream about&#8212;these accomplishments and an astonishing career from a young woman who came to UCSC as a freshman determined to major in languages until she discovered the oceans.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Sullivan received UCSC&#8217;s Alumni Achievement Award in 1984, and the atrium in the Earth and Marine Sciences Building was named in her honor in 2006.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">An accomplished oceanographer, Sullivan earned a Ph.D. in geology at Dalhousie University in Canada. As a member of the NASA astronaut corps, she became the first U.S. woman to walk in space in 1984. Six years later, she joined fellow UCSC grad Steven Hawley (Ph.D., astronomy and astrophysics, '77) on the shuttle mission that deployed the Hubble Space Telescope. She flew on three shuttle missions during her 15-year tenure as an astronaut.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Sullivan was appointed NOAA's chief scientist in 1993, later served a decade as president and CEO of the Center of Science and Industry in Columbus, Ohio, and was the inaugural director of the Battelle Center for Mathematics and Science Education Policy at Ohio State University. She served as NOAA administrator from 2014 to 2017.</span></p>

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The institute will conduct collaborative, multidisciplinary research on climate, oceans, and ecosystems to better understand the coupled systems and assess the physical and biological state of the oceans. CIMEAS will advance regional, national, and global understanding of natural and human-caused impacts on ecosystems and the sustainable ways to strengthen our environmental and economic well-being.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">At UC Santa Cruz, CIMEAS will support ongoing collaborations between researchers in the Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS) and NOAA fisheries scientists. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">CIMEAS will continue to develop and extend our strong collaboration with the National Marine Fisheries Service Southwest Fisheries Science Center,&#8221; said IMS Director Daniel Costa, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology (EEB). &#8220;This program will support critical research into the factors that regulate fisheries along the West Coast of the U.S. It will support graduate students and postdocs as our nation's workforce to understand the role of climate in fisheries management.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Eric Palkovacs, associate professor of EEB and associate director of the Fisheries Collaborative Program, said the UCSC-NOAA collaborations in freshwater and fisheries ecology bring to the campus about $10 million per year in research funding. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">This is a large and vibrant program that supports about 80 UCSC researchers, students, and postdocs working on collaborative projects with the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In addition to UC San Diego and UC Santa Cruz, the institute will include Humboldt State University, Cal State University Los Angeles, the Farallon Institute, Moss Landing Marine Labs managed by San Jose State University, UC Davis, UCLA, and UC Santa Barbara. The range of partner institutions brings significant expertise, facilities, and capabilities to the institute, and will expose NOAA to diverse talent, technology, and ideas. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The selection of UC San Diego to host the institute, made through an open competitive evaluation, comes with an award of up to $220 million over five years, with the potential for renewal for another five years based on successful performance. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span color="#231f20" style="color: #231f20;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In partnership with NOAA and other agencies, CIMEAS will conduct and coordinate innovative research in four main areas, focusing on the western United States, the </span></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><a href="https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov/regions/california-current/ecosystem"><span color="#1155cc" style="color: #1155cc;"><u>California Current</u></span></a></span><span color="#231f20" style="color: #231f20;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, and the Pacific and Southern oceans. The science will support ecosystem-based management of living marine resources; research, development, and technology innovation for global ocean observations and monitoring; coastal and oceanic observations, analysis, and prediction; and weather, water, and climate research.</span></span></p>

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Spin is a fundamental property of electrons and other particles, and the rapidly growing field of spintronics uses spin states in a manner analogous to the use of electrical charge in electronics. Spin can be used as the basis for qubits (quantum bits) and single-photon emitters in applications of quantum information science, including quantum computation, communication, and sensing.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Qubits can be made from any quantum system that has two states, but the challenge is to maintain quantum coherence (a relationship between quantum states) long enough to allow manipulation of the qubits. Decoherence means a loss of information from the system, and spin qubits can lose coherence by interacting with their environment through, for example, lattice vibrations within the material. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The key property for quantum information science is the lifetime of the spin states, known as the spin relaxation and decoherence time,&#8221; said Yuan Ping, assistant professor of chemistry at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;For quantum information applications, we need materials with long spin relaxation times.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In a paper </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16063-5"><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">published </span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>June 3</span></span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> in </span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Nature Communic</i></span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i></i></span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>ations</i></span></u></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, Ping and her coauthors at UC Santa Cruz and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute present a new theoretical framework and computational tools for accurately predicting the spin relaxation time of any material, which was not previously possible. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">These days, people just make a material and try it to see whether it works. Now we have the predictive capability from quantum mechanics that will allow us to design materials with the properties we want for applications in quantum information science,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And if you have a promising material, this can tell you how to change it to make it better.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The researchers established methods for determining spin dynamics from first principles, meaning that no empirical parameters from experimental measurements are needed to do the calculations. They also showed that their approach is generalizable to different types of materials with vastly different crystal symmetries and electronic structures. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">For example, they predicted accurately the spin relaxation time of centrosymmetric materials such as silicon, ferromagnetic iron, and graphene, as well as non-centrosymmetric materials such as molybdenum disulfide and gallium nitride, highlighting the predictive power of their method for a broad range of quantum materials. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">By enabling the rational design of materials, instead of searching blindly and testing a wide range of materials experimentally, these new methods could enable rapid advances in the field of quantum information technologies. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In addition to Ping, the coauthors of the paper include co-first authors Junqing Xu at UC Santa Cruz and Adela Habib at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Feng Wu at UCSC, and Sushant Kumar and Ravishankar Sundararaman at Rensselaer. Ping and Sundararaman are the corresponding authors. This work was supported by the National Science Foundation.

the 2019-20 recipient of the&#160;John Dizikes Teaching Award in Humanities.</span></p>
<p><span>Established in 2002 to honor outstanding teaching by humanities faculty, the annual award is named in honor of the late emeritus professor <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/01/dizikes-obituary.html">John Dizikes</a>, one of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s founding faculty members. It is designed to celebrate the Humanities faculty&#8217;s commitment to excellence in teaching and its impact on undergraduate students.</span></p>
<p><span>"I am thrilled, humbled, and deeply honored to be the recipient of this year's Dizikes Faculty Teaching Award,&#8221; said Young. &#8220;I met John when I was an undergraduate at UCSC in 1969, and have always held him as a standard to reach for as a teacher. I was moved when he asked me to blurb his last book,&#160;<i>Love Songs: The Lives, Loves, and Poetry of Nine American Women</i>. It means a great&#160;deal to be associated with his name.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Young graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 1973 and received his M.F.A. from UC Irvine in 1975. He has taught poetry as a lecturer in creative writing in UCSC&#8217;s Literature Department since 2005. Young is also the director of the Cowell Press, where he teaches printing and book arts.<br/> </span></p>
<p><span>In addition to being honored&#160;with a check for $3,000, the faculty winner is also entitled to select an undergraduate student to receive a $3,000 scholarship. This year, Young decided to split the prize between three of his students&#8212;Carina Mu&#241;oz, Grace Breiger, and Catherine Dohrer.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Carina Mu&#241;oz is a graduating senior literature major with a creative writing concentration,&#8221; said Young. "Carina has been in many classes with me over the past several years, both in poetry workshops and at the Cowell Press, and the senior project she produced in my senior seminar class was just awarded the Best Poetry Senior Project Prize for this year. Carina is going to pursue&#160;an M.F.A. in Creative Writing at Arizona State University in the fall.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Catherine Dohrer is a senior literature major who has also been very active doing exciting work at the Cowell Press for the past two years,&#8221; he added &#8220;And Grace Breiger is a rising junior art and literature major who has excelled in combining text and image in her book works at the Cowell Press.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Young said that he had very few students who couldn't use some financial assistance, and choosing which students to receive the award was difficult.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I decided to spread the wealth among three students because $1,000 is enough money to make a difference, and I felt it was better to help three students rather than one. All three of the recipients are superior students who can use the financial help, though as I say, I could have given this award many times over to other deserving students.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Humanities dean Tyler Stovall noted that students and colleagues have offered high praise for&#160;Young&#8217;s exceptional generosity as a mentor to a striking number of students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;During the period reviewed for his last merit action, 10 of his students went on to M.F.A. or M.A. programs in poetry, a record&#160;that&#160;testifies to the effectiveness of his advising and support for graduate study,&#8221; said Stovall. "One student remarked that &#8216;Gary makes it a point to mentor all of his students equally and fairly.&#160;This connects to Gary&#8217;s extensive knowledge of other cultures and practices, and how he is able to not only learn about other people&#8217;s individual experiences openly, but to teach his students about inclusivity and how to take cultural and societal sensitivity into account inside of the classroom.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Young reflected on his own teaching style.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The pedagogical philosophy I employ teaching creative writing at UCSC springs from a simple but fundamental truth about my students: there is no way to determine which of them will eventually become accomplished, recognized writers. Some students appear to be prodigies, while others struggle. Experience has proven that the prodigy may lose interest or hit a plateau in their artistic growth; the struggling student may simply be a late bloomer who comes to poetry slowly but irrevocably. Because it is impossible to predict which if any of my students might be destined to become great poets, I have to presume that all of them are budding poetic geniuses, and I teach each individual student accordingly. The essence of my teaching practice is straightforward and uncomplicated. I take my students&#8217; work seriously.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Before I begin teaching any class I ask myself the same question: is this a course I would like to have taken when I was a student? I work hard to ensure that my answer is yes. I embrace the responsibility of in loco parentis, and I try to treat each of my students the way I would hope professors have treated my own children, with compassion, honesty, and dedication,&#8221; he added.</span></p>

Tomba&#8217;s in-depth examination of the actions and writings of revolutionaries has revealed different and more complex meanings.<br/><br/>&#8220;I want to give revolution another chance,&#8221; he says.<br/><br/>A prestigious fellowship to Princeton University&#8217;s Shelby Cullom Davis Center will enable Tomba to refine and expand his work on the topic over the next academic year. The annual fellowship brings together accomplished researchers doing parallel scholarship on a theme. The 2020&#8211;2021 theme is &#8220;Revolutionary Change.&#8221;<br/><br/>Tomba&#8217;s work has involved developing new theories through close examination of historical evidence from social movements in Latin America in the 20th century as well as the French Revolution and other European uprisings. He&#8217;s found a sense of the idea that is as much about bringing back what has been taken away as it is about pushing toward an envisioned future.<br/><br/>&#8220;What emerges is a layered concept of revolution in which the ancient notions of revolution, restoration, and restitution are not erased but coexist as temporal stratifications that can be and have been reactivated in specific historical events,&#8221; Tomba says.<br/><br/>Tomba&#8217;s analysis grew out of his preparation for courses he has been teaching, <em>Freedom and Resistance</em>, and <em>What is Revolution</em>. <br/><br/>Tomba&#8217;s approach to studying revolution draws on the evidence activists and insurgents have left, and not so much the writings of recognized movement leaders. In the case of the French Revolution, that means looking beyond the writings of Robespierre to the uprisings that preceded his rise.<br/><br/>&#8220;There was no such thing as a French Revolution, rather many revolutions,&#8221; Tomba says. &#8220;There were declarations of women, black slaves, the poor. Each tried to orient the revolution in a different way.&#8221;<br/><br/>He expects the opportunity to spend nine months in a different environment will enable him to complete the initial chapters of a book destined for print by a university press. <br/><br/>Joining Tomba for his sojourn in New Jersey will be his partner, Associate Professor Banu Bargu, who has been awarded fellowships for the same period by the Institute for Advanced Study and American Council of Learned Societies, along with their 1-year-old son. <br/><br/>When the family returns to UC Santa Cruz, Tomba is expected to chair the History of Consciousness Department.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="80ac64508072701763b3cba60545c79e"><name>mitchell-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Social Sciences recognizes students amid unprecedented times</title><summary>The Social Sciences Division announced the recipients of its annual student achievement awards.</summary><start-date>1591340400000</start-date><display-name>Mitchell-Awards</display-name><path>/2020/06/mitchell-awards</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/06/mitchell-awards</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1591296680972</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1591369088775</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Anthropology</value><value>Economics</value><value>Environmental Studies</value><value>Psychology</value><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value><value>Education</value><value>Politics</value><value>Community Studies</value><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Andrea Limas</name><title></title><phone/><email>alimas@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/06/images/vertical-news-image-1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/06/images/vertical-news-image-1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>vertical-news-image-1.jpg</name><display-name>vertical-news-image-1.jpg</display-name><file-size>138123</file-size><width>342</width><height>792</height></image><image-alt>Photo collage of award recipients</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/06/images/mitchell-awards_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/06/images/mitchell-awards_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mitchell-awards_80.jpg</name><display-name>mitchell-awards_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>8291</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo collage of award recipients</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;During these uncertain times it is more important than ever to honor and recognize the wonderful student work that is continuing in spite of all the challenges that 2020 has presented,&#8221; said Social Sciences Dean Katharye Mitchell. &#8220;I&#8217;m so proud of these students&#8217; ability to adapt, adjust, and achieve so much in their time at UC Santa Cruz.

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gabriel Zimmerman Memorial Scholarship</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This </span><a href="https://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/support-us/awards/student-awards/zimmerman/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scholarship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was established to honor Gabriel "Gabe" Zimmerman, the alum who was shot and killed in the 2011 attack on Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. Zimmerman was working as Giffords' community outreach director at a constituent-engagement event he had organized when gunshots rang out; he ran towards Giffords, who was gravely wounded in the assassination attempt. Gabe was killed. The scholarship was established in the weeks after the shooting by UC Santa Cruz graduates Jonathan Klein (Merrill '89, politics) and Alex Clemens (Porter '89, international politics) and has since attracted support from more than 520 donors. It supports undergraduates who are passionate about social issues and committed to social service.</span></p>

<p>As a geographer with expertise in globalization and global health, Sparke is familiar with the challenges the crisis is laying bare around inequality, access to medical care, and the political and economic determinants of health. He is also familiar with scholarship addressing the global interdependencies that have been exposed and exploited by the crisis.</p>
<p>That's when he decided to write an article in his capacity as editor of the lead journal of the Royal Geographical Society. The virtual special issue of <em>Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers</em>, <a href="https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tran.12389">online now</a>, features Sparke's article, "Contextualizing Coronavirus Geographically," and provides free access to a wide range of previously published geography articles that provide perspective on the pandemic.</p>
<p>"This article represents an attempt to think through what I see as our social and institutional 'response abilities,'" said Sparke. "As an editor of a flagship journal, I felt that we needed to offer fellow geographers and the wider public a road map for connecting existing geographical&#160;work on health and disease with the shared planetary challenge of responding to the crisis."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/04/sparke-health.html">Global and Community Health Program</a> at UCSC, which Sparke is helping to develop, will coordinate the campus's health-related research, as well as offer multidisciplinary bachelor of arts and bachelor of science degrees. "The pandemic underscores the value of developing this Global and Community Health program," said Sparke, a member of the board of the UC Global Health Institute.</p>
<p>Sparke thinks there is a role in this interdisciplinary effort for some of the other geographers at UCSC, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have a geography department, but we do have geographers aplenty appointed across a wide array of disciplines from Sociology, Environmental Studies, and Politics, to Community Studies and Latin American and Latino Studies, as well as in the Physical and Biological Sciences Division," he said. "Geographers bring a capacity to contribute across disciplines, as well as their spatial and contextual concerns, to health challenges such as COVID-19."</p>
<p>But geographers do not think they have a "monopoly on all things spatial," said Sparke. "They just bring a lot of useful ideas about how the geographies of infection, vulnerability, blame, and care intersect and interconnect spatially."</p>
<p>Sparke's article includes links to contributions from several of his UCSC colleagues, including: <span>Sari Niedzwiecki</span>&#160;in Politics, who compares and contrasts how government capacity to enforce lock-downs varies by country; <span>Nancy Chen</span><span>,</span>&#160;whose anthropological work on biosecurity highlights how it can co-generate vulnerability; <span>Jenny Reardon</span>, the director of the Science and Justice Center, who launched a Sociology course on what she calls the &#8216;pandemicine&#8217;; and Chris Benner, the director of the Institute of Social Transformation, who has been writing about the need for <a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/solidarity-economics-for-the-coronavirus-crisis-and-beyond/">solidarity economics</a> in response to the crisis.</p>
<p>Many other UCSC faculty have already contributed crucial crisis responses, said Sparke, including scientists who have created a campus lab for <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/04/coronavirus-testing.html">COVID testing</a>; and the economist Kristian L&#243;pez Vargas,&#160;who helped develop a contact tracing app.</p>
<p>Sparke also noted the contributions UCSC alumni are making during the crisis, including community studies graduate Barbara Ferrer, who leads the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, and journalist and author <span>Laurie Garrett</span>, a leading authority on epidemiology.</p>
<p>UCSC's approach to global health is rooted in a concern with community-level injustice, said Sparke, noting extreme inequalities in health access and health outcomes among residents of Silicon Valley, Pajaro Valley, and the Central Valley.&#160;</p>
<p>"Addressing these local community health inequalities will involve research as well as teaching and curricula development," said Sparke. The campus offers expertise in biological research into neglected diseases and environmental toxicology, as well as social science expertise on the health of vulnerable migrant communities and issues of food security and well-being.&#160;</p>
<p>"Across this range of work, UCSC really can make a big difference," he said. "For now we all have to help get through the COVID crisis together, and my editorial essay was one contribution to this collective effort."</p>

<p>As news outlets published stories about celebrities and athletes unnecessarily getting tested for COVID-19, UC Santa Cruz scientists and staff saw an opportunity to provide fast testing for the community's most vulnerable residents who too often do not have access to the same medical services.</p>
<p>"We have the scientific and regulatory expertise on campus to provide rapid, accurate testing for COVID-19,&#8221; said Isabel Bjork, director of operations for the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute. &#8220;Most importantly though, we have committed researchers and staff who want to use their expertise to help our community. It seemed inconceivable not to act.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/molecular-diagnostic-lab">Molecular Diagnostic Lab</a> has run more than 200 tests for the campus health center and for the community health center since gaining state approval on May 1. The lab is providing rapid test results for the Santa Cruz community while also increasing the overall testing capacity in the county. The diagnostic lab is just one example of how UC Santa Cruz serves the community.</p>
<p>Testing is a critical piece in containing the virus's spread and being able to reopen more parts of the economy. The lab is currently capable of doing 184 tests per day, though it can surge to just under 400, if needed. Scientists are developing plans to further scale up testing.</p>
<p>Bjork previously served on the board of directors for Santa Cruz Community Health and saw the nonprofit as a natural partner in the campus's initiative to start a diagnostic lab for COVID-19 testing.</p>
<p>The health center, which started in 1974 as a women's health collective, has grown to provide care to about 12,000 people every year, regardless of their ability to pay, including about 1,700 who are homeless.</p>
<p>"Given that the virus knows no bounds the community&#8217;s shared interests are more apparent than ever," health center CEO Leslie Conner said. "The pandemic reveals how interdependent we are&#8212;and the strength in working together."</p>
<p>As the novel coronavirus hit Santa Cruz County, the health center quickly shifted its operations to focus on tele-health before transitioning its Live Oak clinic into a respiratory site for COVID-19 testing and using its downtown site for urgent care, prenatal visits, and other care that couldn't be delivered by telephone. The clinic was working with a major lab for COVID-19 tests and had to wait up to six days for results.</p>
<p>"It was starting to get better, but a 24-hour turnaround was really appealing," Conner said.</p>
<p>The campus first tested health center employees to ensure they were not infected with COVID-19, Conner said, and has started testing its patients, about two dozen per week so far.</p>
<p>The quicker results are critical to reducing the spread of COVID-19. For people who are homeless and test positive, Conner said the county is providing isolation and quarantine sites.</p>
<p>Both the university and health center are driven by a mission of serving the public, the health center through its comprehensive health services, and the university through research, teaching, and community service. Conner said she hopes this partnership will lead to other collaborations down the line.</p>
<p>"The university has resources, scientific experts, and research&#8212;these help advance our goals," she said. "Likewise, we offer an opportunity on the frontlines through which the university can activate an even greater role in advancing equity and social justice."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="815ff5b48072701763b3cba6668a663e"><name>tomorrow-chancellor-and-senior-leadership-forum</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Tomorrow—Chancellor and Senior Leadership Forum</title><summary>The SAB wanted to send a quick reminder about tomorrow's Chancellor and Senior Leadership Forum.</summary><start-date>1591254000000</start-date><display-name>Tomorrow—Chancellor and Senior Leadership Forum</display-name><path>/2020/06/tomorrow-chancellor-and-senior-leadership-forum</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/06/tomorrow-chancellor-and-senior-leadership-forum</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1591308449178</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1591308449178</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Dear UCSC Staff<br/><br/>The SAB wanted to send a quick reminder about tomorrow's Chancellor and Senior Leadership Forum.

Heartbreaking national events weigh heavily, and many in our community are grappling with our complicity in an ongoing system of oppression and how we can work harder to repair the harm our complacency has caused. The SAB invited a few folks to our call who can address questions that may help us address questions that come up about campus climate in this difficult time. If folks think another forum dedicated to addressing the civil rights issues most recently brought to the fore, we welcome that feedback and would be open to partnering with groups to bring such an

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span>UC Santa Cruz associate history professor Gregory O&#8217;Malley has received a 2020 Digital Extension Grant of $150,000 from The American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) to expand coverage of the <a href="https://www.slavevoyages.org/american/database"><strong><i>Intra-American Slave Trade Database</i></strong></a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>This expansion will include adding data and materials on 19th-century forced movement of enslaved people born in America, as well as lesson plans to help K-12 and university instructors incorporate the database into curricula.</span></p>
<p><span>The ACLS program is designed to help advance the digital transformation of humanities scholarship by extending the reach of existing digital projects and adding diversity to the digital record.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;At a time when difficult but much needed conversations are dominating the national discourse and as we continue to traverse this new era of social distancing, ACLS is proud to support advances in digital research and scholarly communication that can contribute positively on both fronts,&#8221; noted ACLS President Joy Connolly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Thanks to the generosity of the Mellon Foundation, these vital, cutting-edge projects will pursue important research while expanding access to digital resources among a variety of new communities. This program exemplifies our commitment to serving a broad spectrum of learners and diversifying humanistic scholarship.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>O&#8217;Malley noted that The Intra-American Slave Trade Database&#160;currently documents more than 11,500 trading voyages that forcibly moved enslaved people from one part of the Americas to another. The database is freely accessible online for the use of academic researchers, students, and the general public.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The project includes voyages as far north as Newfoundland and as far south as Argentina, with coverage focused on trafficking African-born individuals in the 17th and 18th centuries. With the Digital Extension Grant, we will collaborate with additional scholars at different career stages to expand coverage of the database into the 19th century and to include the trafficking of enslaved people born in the Americas.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;This expansion will focus particular attention on the domestic slave trades of the United States and Brazil,&#8221; O&#8217;Malley added. &#8220;We will also increase the utility of the database for classrooms by working with educators to create sample lesson plans using the database.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>O&#8217;Malley is the author of </span><span><i>Final Passages: The Intercolonial Slave Trade of British America, 1619-1807</i></span><span>, a 2015 book that has won<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span>multiple awards for helping to redraw the map of the forced African migration during the slave trade era.</span></p>

As a preeminent representative of American scholarship in the humanities, the ACLS holds a core belief that knowledge is a public

within the UCSC Genomics Institute.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute&#8217;s Genome Browser Team has received seed funding from the UC Office of the President for its work on the UCSC Genome Browser for SARS-CoV-2, which supports biomedical research aimed at developing therapeutics and a vaccine for COVID-19.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The team fast-tracked efforts to adapt the <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Genome Browser</a> to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19) in February, when labs around the world began sequencing the viral genome. The browser is an interactive online tool that gives researchers easy access to the latest molecular data related to the coronavirus genome.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Researchers are generating molecular data pertaining to the SARS-CoV-2 genome and its proteins at an unprecedented rate during the COVID-19 pandemic,&#8221; said Max Haeussler, an assistant research scientist at the Genomics Institute. &#8220;As a result, there is a critical need for rapid and continuously updated access to the latest molecular data in a format in which all data can be quickly cross-referenced and compared.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In recent weeks, the UCSC SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser has received an average of 12,500 page hits per week, and usage continues to grow, Haeussler said. The browser provides easily accessible information on, for example, where new mutations in the viral genome are located, how common they are in other coronaviruses, and what their impacts are on viral proteins. Researchers can also see which parts of the viral genome are being studied by other researchers, with annotations providing information about published data on, for example, the immune response to the virus and points of interaction between human and viral genes.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">UC has awarded $2 million in seed funding for important research across the state aimed at mitigating the impact of COVID-19, particularly among those at greater risk for infection and adverse outcomes. UC awarded the funds to support rapid-response, high-impact research in vaccines, therapeutics, clinical management, epidemiology, and other COVID-19 related areas.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">A crucial consideration of selected applications was the ability of researchers to start work immediately, as COVID-19 continues to affect millions globally and requires urgent solutions. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">This is a challenging time for our country and for those suffering from COVID-19,&#8221; said UC President Janet Napolitano. &#8220;With some of the world&#8217;s premier researchers and scientists working to find answers to this disease and ways to alleviate its impacts, UC is in a prime position to make a real difference for those most at-risk.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The research awards provide up to $25,000 in seed funding to each selected proposal. The projects were approved for six months after which time researchers can apply for additional funds to continue their projects and build upon their research successes.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/</url><title>UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/02/coronavirus-genome.html</url><title>Coronavirus genome posted on the UCSC Genome Browser</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="94cc272e8072701763b3cba6381a3eda"><name>reminder-nominations-for-ucsc-outstanding-staff-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Reminder: Nominations for UC Santa Cruz’s Outstanding Staff Award</title><summary>The submission deadline is Monday, June 8, 2020.</summary><start-date>1591340400000</start-date><display-name>Reminder: Nominations for UC Santa Cruz’s Outstanding Staff Award</display-name><path>/2020/06/reminder-nominations-for-ucsc-outstanding-staff-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/06/reminder-nominations-for-ucsc-outstanding-staff-award</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1591634306814</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1591634306814</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>Do you know a UC Santa Cruz staff member who:</span></p>

Recovery activities at the Silicon Valley Campus and MBEST will follow on a parallel process, though under orders of Santa Clara County and Monterey County respectively. This work is being facilitated through the Recovery and Resiliency Task Force structure.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To support the public health of our community, the in-person return of our workforce and our students to onsite operations at all UC Santa Cruz locations will be conducted in a phased manner. The guiding emphasis of decisions will be on public health and reducing COVID-19 spread, while supporting our academic mission. In addition to the planning outlined below, work groups are also focused on several other areas of in-person resumption planning, including student support services, employee resiliency and morale, and remote working best practices and guidelines.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Though Santa Cruz County has been approved to move to Stage 2 of the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591715308596000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFmV3PceIFDrSXJJ_iCgsN1Qpr8lw" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>California Resilience Roadmap to Recovery</span></a><span>, county orders currently allow us to operate only those activities that facilitate remote learning or performing essential functions. Higher education is listed by the state as one of the sectors still not allowed to fully operate in-person. The majority of operations continue to be remote. Essential functions allowed to take place on-site must continue to be undertaken in compliance with existing orders from the state and county. We are closely monitoring and assessing these orders as they are updated.</span></p>

They align with the stages of the California Resilience Roadmap. The specifics and timing of the campus phases are subject to change as adjustments are made at the county and state level. As Santa Cruz County now moves into Stage 2 of the state roadmap, UCSC is moving into Phase 3 of our campus plan for resuming in-person operations. At this point, all activities that can be carried out remotely will continue to do so.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Increases in county or regional COVID-19 positive cases may require regional Public Health Departments (County of Santa Cruz, Santa Clara County, etc.) to issue new orders that may result in the campus adjusting plans and reverting to prior phases.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><br/></span><strong>Instruction, research, co-curricular and housing planning</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span></span><span>The Academic Recovery and Resiliency Task Force continues its work in developing the proposals for research, instruction, co-curricular activities, student housing and dining services. As proposals and recommendations come from this group, the Operations and Employee Recovery and Resiliency Task Force works to operationalize them in a way to advance public health and comply with the many Federal, State, County, and UC directives and guidelines framing campus in-person resumption efforts.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As communicated on June 1 by CPEVC Kletzer, the approach to fall 2020 class scheduling is proceeding along this path:&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>With the possible exception of upper division lab, studio, field study or project capstone courses, any class that course sponsors have indicated can be converted to remote instruction will be scheduled with a location of &#8220;Remote Instruction.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Courses with class sizes of 40 and higher, regardless of indicated instructional methods, will not be offered in-person. This initial maximum class size of 40 may be reduced as we continue our planning efforts.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Secondary sections, secondary laboratories, and secondary studios will not be offered in-person.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>At this point, campus housing is developing a plan to provide some housing (likely limited to singles and doubles where appropriate and consistent with health and safety guidelines) for fall 2020. Housing priority decisions are still under development. Quarantine and isolation space is also being integrated into housing plans.&#160;</span></p>

Guidance and compliance standards are emerging daily and planning needs to be understood in the context that these requirements may change at any moment.&#160; In addition to campus subject matter experts, two external Public Health Advisors from the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health will review and opine on various aspects of in-person resumption planning.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Decisions as to which units and cohorts return in-person and the timing of such return will be dependent upon many aspects of analyses.&#160;&#160;These decisions will be managed as outlined below at the principal officer level. No programs or staff are allowed to resume in-person operations without approval. As restrictions on various activities are lifted via State and County Orders, and taking into account the specific directives accompanying such allowance, a process of review takes place with relevant Principal Officers and the Operations Recovery and Resiliency Work Group, chaired by Associate Vice Chancellor for Risk and Safety Services Scott. We will develop our phased plan with emphasis on those operations and educational programs that require in-person, onsite operations as a first priority over those operations, employees and services that may continue to operate remotely.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The campus will need to ensure that any function that returns to an in-person, onsite modality meets the five elements that the state has laid out for opening of services. The state roadmap dictates that before resuming in-person onsite operations, organizations must:</span><span><br/></span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Perform a detailed risk assessment and implement a site-specific protection plan</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Train employees on how to limit the spread of COVID-19, including how to screen themselves for symptoms and stay home if they have them</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Implement individual control measures and screenings</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Implement disinfecting protocols</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Implement physical distancing guidelines</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Below are some of the key elements of the campus review and engagement process that are intended to address these five areas, as well as the other requirements laid out by the agencies outlined above. These elements have been piloted as essential operations have been functioning on-campus and as additional in-person research operations have resumed on campus.&#160; The tools used will continue to adapt over time as additional in-person operations resume.&#160; Units should not develop their own protocols in any of the following areas, due to compliance, legal, and privacy considerations.&#160;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Worksite Plans:</strong><span>&#160;For every function that resumes in-person operations, a Worksite Plan will need to be completed. The initial pilot of this tool was used doing building assessments for the in-person resumption of key research activities.&#160; This process has been designed to assist management with ensuring that their facilities have integrated both standardized and unique physical mitigations to reduce public health exposure and ensure compliance with all related regulatory requirements, including Cal OSHA. A detailed review of facility systems is also included (air handling, water system flush, etc.)</span><span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Employee Training:</strong><span> As a part of in-person, on-site resumption efforts, the University as employer is required to deliver COVID-19 specific training for employees.&#160; This includes student employees. Environmental Health and Safety (EH&amp;S) has coordinated this training. The initial training pilot is in the process of being moved to the campus Learning Management System. This shift is expected to be complete mid-June. Development of educational programming for students who are not employees is underway. As employees and students return to on-site locations, they will be required to abide by community standards for health, wellbeing and reducing COVID-19 spread.</span><span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><strong>Asymptomatic Testing and Contact Tracing: </strong></span><span>The UC Office of the President (UCOP) has released guidelines for campuses on asymptomatic testing and contact tracing.&#160; These recommendations will frame the campus testing and contact tracing plan. On June 1st, the campus launched a pilot voluntary asymptomatic testing program for a specific cohort of employees. The cohort was chosen due to their front line contact with others on campus and in the community and complies with the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Expanding-Access-to-Testing-Updated-Interim-Guidance-on-Prioritization-for-COVID-19-Laboratory-Testing-0501.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591715308597000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEeG9pHjeRfJg3b85QRB2xP5B81cQ" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Expanding-Access-to-Testing-Updated-Interim-Guidance-on-Prioritization-for-COVID-19-Laboratory-Testing-0501.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>tiering priority</span></a><span> outlined by the California Department of Public Health. This pilot involves a cohort of approximately 160 individuals. Once initial review of the pilot is complete, other cohort groups will be assessed for integration as our ability to expand testing grows. This is currently a voluntary program.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Currently, the campus has a well-defined program to direct any symptomatic individuals who require testing. This process is overseen by the Student Health Center. Our testing and response procedures for symptomatic students and employees, and the subsequent requirements for communication with the county, have been in place for over three months. Required campus notification protocols are also well established in situations where such notification is necessary.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Symptom Monitoring:</strong><span> As a part of in-person, on-site resumption efforts, the University as employer is required to have a process for conducting daily COVID-19 symptom checks of employees who are working on site. Currently, all those accessing campus should continue to abide by prior guidance posted online and check their symptoms daily and stay home and seek medical care&#160;if they are feeling sick.&#160;A new COVID-19 symptom check application that has been adopted at peer UC campuses is being implemented at UCSC. More information on this application will be sent to the campus in the days to come.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Campus In-person Resumption Plan</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The first version of the campus in-person resumption plan will be issued mid June. As campus operational decisions are made and as state, county and UC directives and guidelines change, subsequent versions of the plan will be released. This plan has been developed using guidance from the agencies noted above, coordination with other UC campuses, as well as local and systemwide subject matter experts. It includes information on the basic processes outlined above as well as additional details on in-person resumption planning.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In addition, a new campus COVID-19 recovery site is being built and will launch shortly.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Faculty and Staff</audience><admin>Sarah Latham, Vice Chancellor, Business and Administrative Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="94e3d35b8072701763b3cba6323398e6"><name>new-strong-slug</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A sporting new look for the Banana Slug</title><summary>Athletics and Recreation has just revealed a brand-new riff on the Sammy Slug character, with a sleek and immediately recognizable design that is meant to evoke the department’s core values: inclusivity, ambition, and progressive values.</summary><start-date>1591635600000</start-date><display-name>New Strong Slug</display-name><path>/2020/06/new-strong-slug</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/06/new-strong-slug</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1591635858238</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1609883479835</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/06/images/strongslugbrandoverview500-v2.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/06/images/strongslugbrandoverview500-v2.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>strongslugbrandoverview500-v2.jpg</name><display-name>strongslugbrandoverview500-v2.jpg</display-name><file-size>132847</file-size><width>500</width><height>292</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/07/images/strongslugbrandthumbnail80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/07/images/strongslugbrandthumbnail80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>strongslugbrandthumbnail80.jpg</name><display-name>strongslugbrandthumbnail80.jpg</display-name><file-size>16032</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Here are a few of the images showing the new look of the Strong Slug.&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">This decision to make a logo change was not taken lightly; in fact, Athletics and Recreation has held five input sessions and collected over 15,000 survey responses.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the time has come for the Changing of the Slug. Athletics and Recreation has just revealed a brand-new riff on the Sammy Slug character, with a sleek and immediately recognizable design that is meant to evoke the department&#8217;s core values: inclusivity, ambition, and progressive values.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stylish new slug looks adventurous and bold, with a smile on its face. The marquee icon has trees in the background, referencing UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s wooded campus as well as its commitment to the environment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The up-to-date version of the Athletics and Recreation mascot was announced after a virtual ceremony on June 5,&#160; honoring outstanding student-athletes who have demonstrated their prowess in the classroom and in competition within the past academic year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clint Angus, associate director for Athletics and Recreation at UC Santa Cruz, is excited about the switch-up. He mentioned that the current version of the Strong Slug&#160; is challenging to reproduce clearly.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m wearing a Strong Slug shirt right now, with an embroidered slug on it, but it came out cross-eyed,&#8217;&#8217; he said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t even tell that it&#8217;s a slug. One goal for the new slug is that people will look at it and say, &#8216;Obviously, it&#8217;s a slug.'&#8217;&#8217;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Angus emphasized that the rolling out of this new Banana Slug design does not mean that the department is in any way abandoning the old &#8220;Strong Slug.&#8221; Out of respect to its fans, the old version will live on as a &#8220;heritage mark&#8221; that will be rolled out on special occasions, including events in which &#8220;vintage-wear&#8221; and nostalgia are part of the appeal.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have a really small but passionate community that loves it,&#8221; Angus said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Honoring the traditional</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After looking into several options, Athletics and Recreation decided to hire the New Jersey&#8211;based firm Skye Design Studios, a national leader in sports branding, creating comprehensive identities within all categories of the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skye Dillon, owner of Skye Design Studios, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">says the new version honors the UC Santa Cruz traditional Fiat Slug.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is gender-neutral; incorporates anatomical detail; highlights environmental awareness; positions the department clearly within the UC system; conveys our active, fit, and confident persona through the stylistic lens of a lifestyle brand. But most importantly, it reflects the collective voice of the entire UC Santa Cruz community,&#8221; Dillon said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skye Design worked hard to respect the integrity of the slug&#8212;the Fiat Slug version, as well as the real ones, slowly gliding their way across the forested UC Santa Cruz campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were mindful about asking the community about anatomical correctness throughout the campaign,&#8221; Angus said. &#8220;Most of our survey respondents were interested in a caricature more than a literal interpretation of the Banana Slug.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While we couldn't effectively put Sammy's eyes on stalks and maintain the character's personality, we were able to include the pneumostome [a slug&#8217;s respiratory opening] in the design, which is unique to our mascot and a nod to our science-centered folks on campus,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>The Slugs, they are a changin&#8217;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This decision to make a logo change was not taken lightly; in fact, Athletics and Recreation has held five input sessions and collected over 15,000 survey responses. Roughly 70 percent of the respondents favored a new Strong Slug design.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final version was approved by a committee consisting of UC Santa Cruz students, faculty, staff, alumni, and local community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive praised the new design. &#8220;I&#8217;m really excited about this outcome,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Obviously, everything changed this year because of covid-19, but the way (Athletics) was able to handle the outreach, with 15,000 survey responses throughout the academic year, is really fantastic.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think this is a great way for us to be forward-looking in this difficult time,&#8221; Larive continued. &#8220;A number of people have told me how excited they are to get new Banana Slug gear. We are going to see this as a point of pride when we can get together in person again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff members have also spent significant amounts of time looking at the facial expressions of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Fiat Slug logo and its various spin-off versions, while letting their imaginations loose.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We looked at everything&#8212;the placement of the antennae, the eyebrows, the smile, the mouth, the shape of the nose, the face, all those elements together,&#8221; Angus said. &#8220;We had to play with it so it showed the connection to the Fiat Slug, but gave you a sense of what it would look like if that slug took off its glasses and just started running.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The catalyst for change was new leadership in the department, Angus said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We identified that the brand is super-important. Before we can do other things that are fun and cool for the university community, we had to get the brand right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our goal with this campaign was to create a brand identity that melds with the Fiat Slug character, but also instills unity and pride, and not just in athletics. We want it to be inclusive. We want it to be accessible enough so people can say, &#8216;I&#8217;m not an athlete, but I&#8217;d still love to see that slug on a shirt I can wear.'&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="961195d38072701763b3cba6e384e76f"><name>statement-social-media</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Statement on deeply troubling social media posts</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz is aware of the deeply troubling social media allegations against the Sigma Pi fraternity, its members, and other students.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus has placed the fraternity on an interim suspension, pending the outcome of an investigation into the student organization. The interim suspension restricts the organization from holding meetings, recruiting members, and conducting any activities as a student organization.</span></p>

<p>Due to the COVID&#8211;19 pandemic, the luncheon with Chancellor Cynthia Larive had to be postponed.</p>
<p>The committee received approximately 675 student nominations and selected eight instructors from all five divisions to receive this award. The student comments about the impact their excellent pedagogical practice has had on their lives were inspiring for the committee to read. COT appreciates their contribution to the important mission of teaching on our campus.</p>
<p>In addition, the Committee on Teaching is thrilled to announce the recent establishment of the annual peer nominated <a href="https://senate.ucsc.edu/committees/cot-committee-on-teaching/cot-to-chairs,-directors-and-managers-re-new-distinguished-teaching-award-040620.pdf">Distinguished Teaching Award</a>. The announcement of the recipient will be forthcoming.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s recipients are:</p>
<h3>Professor Nathan Altice, Teaching Professor, Computational Media</h3>
<p><em>&#8220;Professor Altice has clear lectures; interdisciplinarity experience and a great sense of humor make Professor Altice the best on campus. He interacts with students, dedicates time to take feedback, improves his courses every year and most importantly he makes sure you&#8217;re being helped. I have learned not only the subject matter I was supposed to learn, but even more about the material&#8217;s practical use in the field and more insight on how other disciplines will play into my knowledge/field. Professor Altice is an amazing instructor and deserves nothing less than this award.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Professor Altice is the most practiced and passionate lecturer I have had at UCSC. Every lecture has had clear effort put into it. He inspires his students in every class to think about creative projects from a different point of view than they are used to, and he is the most approachable professor I have interacted with on any campus, not just UCSC. My intellectual growth has been developed by Professor Altice making time for me, and other students, to pursue our area of study (game design) outside of his scheduled office hours and lecture times. He also never fails to listen when a student reaches out for advice or for help.&#8221;</em></p>
<h3>Professor Peter Alvaro, Assistant Professor, Computer Science and Engineering</h3>
<p><em>&#8220;Professor Alvaro was able to take a topic that is generally reserved for Graduate students and condense it into a class that is both informative and formative for Computer Science students. His selection of guest lecturers provided me with perspectives and contacts for post graduation. Finally his willingness to engage with students outside of class made the class seem much more intimate than the 100 student size would suggest. Overall, this has been my favorite class and one that will help me immensely in my endeavors post graduation.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Professor Alvaro truly cares that everyone of his students understands the material. In his class, there are no bad questions. He is also exceptional at making the class environment feel like a safe space where people can learn and enjoy what they learn too. He makes the material interesting by relating the material to real life technologies. He also arranged for many industry professionals to visit the classroom to help us get a better insight into what it will be like having a job in the technology industry. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Professor Alvaro&#8217;s class and if I have the option I would love to have Professor Alvaro in one of the last classes I will take at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</em></p>
<h3>Professor Javier Fern&#225;ndez Ag&#252;era, Lecturer, Language and Applied Linguistics</h3>
<p><em>&#8220;Professor Ag&#252;era is by far the best language professor I could&#8217;ve asked for. He made every class engaging through activities and assignments that helped me in the real world, there wasn&#8217;t a single dull day in his class. He was super accessible for tutoring and answering questions, especially in rough times during the strike, he went the extra mile to provide us students with the best education possible. He made himself available on weekends and such to meet our needs. He continually showed how much he genuinely cares about his students, reminding us to take care of our mental health and not to stress out. He would go over the moon to make class exciting and useful. I feel more empowered to pursue language now more than ever because of his encouragement. I could go on and on about how phenomenal Professor Ag&#252;era is as a professor, he deserves all the recognition and praise.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Professor Ag&#252;era is an amazing Spanish Professor. I learned so much Spanish in the short 10 weeks, every time I stepped into the classroom it was like entering a completely different space. Professor Ag&#252;era immersed us into as much Spanish as he could by basically teaching the class in Spanish to a group of students who know close to 0 Spanish. I would go home and tell my friends about my class and my professor and come to class so excited to learn from a professor who was so excited to teach. The classroom was always full of active learning and laughing and questions.&#8221;</em></p>
<h3>Professor Megan McNamara, Lecturer, Sociology</h3>
<p><em>&#8220;Professor McNamara&#8217;s teaching style is different from other professors, yet the most effective in my opinion. She likes to do in-class activities after her short lectures since she believes that is the best way to retain the information we just received. This teaching style has helped me a lot and I still remember a lot of the things she taught to this day. She is very passionate on what she&#8217;s teaching and it shows when she is teaching in class. What I like about Professor McNamara is that she tries to build a connection with her students to the point where she doesn&#8217;t only see us as students, but as friends and human beings. She has given me a lot of confidence and even offered to write me a letter of recommendation if needed. I am thankful for everything Professor McNamara has done for me and I believe her hard work deserves to be recognized and appreciated.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Professor McNamara is an exceptional lecturer. From the first day of class, she expressed a genuine care for her students, and among all the distractions and stresses that were experienced during winter quarter, Professor McNamara was sure to communicate with students in such a way that was understanding and tended to students&#8217; socio-emotional wellbeing. As a sociologist, she expressed her passion for the subject by connecting relevant aspects of deviance to current events. Her transparency allowed students to relate, connect, and feel seen, motivated and able.&#8221;</em></p>
<h3>Professor Russell Rodriguez, Assistant Professor, Music</h3>
<p><em>&#8220;Professor Rodr&#237;guez serves a variety of learning styles, as he teaches music through giving us sheet music and playing the song through for us, often on his own instrument, before we attempt it ourselves. He gives a lot of supplemental material for us to get used to knowing what to listen for in Mariachi style music, and provides a large amount of support to students of every instrument with his wide range of knowledge on each one. He will never give us a part he&#8217;s not willing to work on to get himself. He is approachable and the way he speaks of his own experiences is both motivational and peaks the interest of many students who are not what the department might consider traditional music students. Professor Rodr&#237;guez is not only an essential instructor to the student of color experience within the music department, but UCSC as a whole.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Professor Rodr&#237;guez always has us, the students, at the top of his list of priorities when it comes to music. He arrived to teach on campus in the winter quarter of my first year and since then I have continued to take this class. His numerous talents not only inspire us to strive to his level of passion, but make us aware of how lucky we are to have him as a teacher. As a Latina, he has opened up a space in the music department that has been absent for a long time; a space for people of color to feel safe making music that they can connect to in some aspect. Because we loved what we were learning in the class, we even made a club outside of our academic schedules and he kept pushing us to make the organization happen. Professor Rodr&#237;guez shows his passion by taking the time to talk to us individually and supporting our endeavors in college. He also brings in real Mariachi players to demonstrate the kind of power and sound we should be striving for. He acknowledges our talents by making us aware of opportunities for performance/music related assignments outside of class. He is the kind of teacher that is rare to come by and I hope he will be recognized for all of his work.&#8221;</em></p>
<h3>Professor Savannah Shange, Assistant Professor, Anthropology and Critical Race and Ethnic Studies</h3>
<p><em>&#8220;Professor Shange is the most engaging lecturer I have ever had. She manages to turn a 60 - 100 person lecture into feeling as though there are 20&#8211;30 people in the classroom. She does this by using an extraordinary amount of energy in the presentation of the course material (it feels like she is performing but not in an over the top manner) as well as by incorporating a large variety of teaching mediums. She uses small groups to allow students more in-depth engagement on Text analysis, thesis refinement and critical thinking. She also uses other sources such as film, social media and music to assist in her teaching. Professor Shange strives to be in touch with each group of students she is teaching so that she prioritizes flexibility so that she can respond to our needs as students in real time. I highly recommend her for this award.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Professor Shange is the most dynamic educator that I have ever come across. Her knowledge for the subjects she teaches, the creativity and interaction she requires within her lessons/assignments, the community she fosters in her classroom and her pure excitement to be doing this work is why I am nominating her.&#8221;</em></p>
<h3>Professor Bakthan Singaram, Professor, Chemistry</h3>
<p><em>&#8220;Professor Singaram was overall the best, and my favorite, STEM professor I have ever had. Organic chemistry is known to be one of the hardest science classes one could ever take, and although it was definitely difficult from beginning to end, he always had everyone&#8217;s success in mind. After seeing how everyone had struggled to grasp the material in the first exam, he definitely shifted his way of teaching and made 50% of the second exam almost the same as the practice. Having studied his practice exam, I improved &#126;50% in comparison to the first exam (38/96 on the first midterm and 85/96 and on the second). Not only did his practice exam help guide my studying, it was also an alternate means of me learning and practicing reagent mechanisms and their effects on chemical structures. It helped me for problems that differed from his practice exam, and it was the first exam I have ever taken in STEM that I left feeling confident about. Professor Singaram is a caring, intelligent, and encouraging professor whose knowledge of organic chemistry can change the world. I believe he deserves this nomination because not only is he a great professor, but he is also very humble in a world where having that much knowledge is something to be prideful of. I only had one office hour interaction with him which occurred after he returned our first exams. Sitting there with my 38/96 in front of him, I expected the worst but he offered me the guidance I needed and I felt as though he knew I could improve; and I did. If there&#8217;s anything I can take away from him, it&#8217;s not the chemical reactions, but his humbleness, understanding, and his donkey story he shared with us on our last day: &#8216;Don&#8217;t try and please everyone else.&#8217;&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;This man is a legend. He goes above and beyond for his students putting 4+ hours of his time aside each day to host office hours designed to foster academic excellence. He is super accommodating and gives really straightforward notes and lectures.&#8221;</em></p>
<h3>Professor Amanda Smith, Assistant Professor, Literature</h3>
<p><em>&#8220;Professor Smith&#8217;s pedagogy is rigorous, equity-centered, honors her students&#8217; humanity and our need to develop professionally. She demonstrates her passion for the subject at every turn (example: putting us in direct contact, via zoom and via mail, with the writers and cultural producers whose work we were studying), provides multiple opportunities for us to develop professionally while engaging with the subject matter meaningfully (examples: assignments tailored to applying for conferences, publishing book reviews, and designing syllabi related to the course topic), fostered a warm and collaborative learning community in the classroom, and conducted the course with a flexibility that honored students&#8217; lived experience and the material reality of this quarter (example: tailored the final assignment so that students were able to use course material to respond meaningfully to the ongoing grad student strike/movement for COLA). Her class provided the type of grounding and community that we needed to be able to continue learning and growing in community as scholars through a very difficult quarter, and her support for her students is beautiful and unwavering. I learned so much from her as a teacher, a scholar, and a human being&#8212;she really deserves this award.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Professor Smith supported me and my classmates during what has turned out to be one of my most difficult quarters in recent history. She modeled radical adaptability and compassion which guided me through my own instruction and interactions with my undergraduate students. I feel like so many talk about what a better pedagogy looks like but it wasn&#8217;t until Professor Smith&#8217;s that I was able to experience this first hand and in turn, attempt to practice it myself. She has given me the tools, and experiences, that I needed to re-imagine education. She absolutely deserves this award.&#8221;</em></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

the author of 15 books, translated into 23 languages, and has been a constant contributor for over three decades to&#160;<i>Time</i>,<i>&#160;The New York Times, Harper&#8217;s&#160;Magazine</i>,&#160;the&#160;<i>Los Angeles Times</i><em>,</em> and more than 250 other periodicals worldwide.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Born in England to parents from India, raised in California, and educated at Eton, Oxford, and Harvard, he has been largely based in Japan since 1987.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span><i>Literary Quarterly</i> once described him as "the poet laureate of wanderlust,&#8221; noting &#8220;his perennial subject is the strange confluences and poignant idiosyncrasies born of our world's dissolving borders, and he explores it with a rich mixture of astonishing erudition and wide-eyed wonder.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>On June 15, Bookshop Santa Cruz and The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz will present an online event featuring the bestselling author in conversation with UC Santa Cruz history professor Alan Christy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>They will discuss Iyer&#8217;s latest book, <i>Autumn Light: Season of Fire and Farewells</i>&#8212;an exploration of Japanese history and culture and a moving meditation on impermanence, mortality, and grief&#8212;and a companion book, <i>A Beginner's Guide to Japan</i>, now in paperback.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Both of these books draw extensively from his 30 years of living in Japan.&#160;<i>Autumn Light</i> examines aging, death and the fracturing of family life&#8212;seen though the lens of Japanese culture. Iyer recounts his efforts and those of his Japanese wife, Hiroko, to deal with her father&#8217;s death, her mother entering a nursing home, and her estrangement from her brother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The <i>New York Journal of Books</i> noted that <i>Autumn Light</i>&#160;profoundly &#8220;succeeds, with its deceptively quiet descriptions of autumn both in the natural world, and in the season of his and Hiroko&#8217;s own lives, in echoing a uniquely Japanese appreciation of the fleeting nature of time, as well as the humbling acceptance that nothing lasts.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span><i>A Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Japan: Observations and Provocations</i>, is a very different yet complementary work in which Iyer draws from his travels, conversations, readings, and reflections to create a playful book of surprising, brief, astute glimpses into Japanese culture. He describes his adventures and thoughts as he travels from a meditation hall to a love hotel, from West Point to Kyoto Station, and from dinner with Meryl Streep to an ill-fated call to the Apple service center.</span></p>
<p><span>Professor Christy has been with the History Department at UC Santa Cruz since 1995, including a two-year stint as a visiting associate professor at the University of Tokyo from 2004-2006. He studies the history of Japan and is director of the Okinawa Memories Initiative, a public history project that explores the postwar Okinawan-American relationship in Okinawa and throughout the Pacific region. He is also the provost of Cowell College.</span></p>
<p><span>Well-versed in Japanese culture and history, Christy said he hopes to discuss a wide variety of topics with Iyer in their virtual conversation&#8212; including the themes of living with mortality and uncertainty that run through Iyer&#8217;s books and what we might learn from the culture of impermanence in Japan</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I think I'd like to talk with him about what thinking about Japan can do for us right now,&#8221; said Christy. &#8220;Japan is a place of continual catastrophes (earthquakes, tsunamis, fires). As we struggle with this pandemic and uncertainty, I would ask &#8216;what lessons does he see for us from his experiences in Japan?&#8221;</span></p>

In particular, this is a call for the academic community as knowledge producers and as educators to take seriously our ethical obligation to eradicate anti-Black racism and discrimination.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Organizers have called for us to recognize June 10 as a day to educate ourselves and others about our role in perpetuating racism as well as to create action plans to carry anti-racist work forward. We encourage you to take time today to heed this call. We also ask that supervisors across campus accommodate this movement in all ways that do not compromise access to student-support services and campus health and safety needs.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>On our campus, &#8220;business as usual&#8221; has for too long meant responding only when frustration and anger have reached a fever pitch, and then only to the symptoms of inequity, not the underlying structures. In the coming weeks and months, we invite you to join us in breaking this cycle. Today is a symbolic step that will be followed by consistent action in all domains of our shared enterprise.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The institutional focus must shift to explore the many ways that inequity impedes our ability to achieve our mission. One highly visible example that will be the focus of our work in the coming academic year is in graduation gaps between students from different backgrounds and racial groups. Such gaps can no longer be acceptable or normal at UC Santa Cruz. Many things contribute to these gaps including feeling unwelcome on our campus, lacking appropriate financial support, and administrative processes that are misaligned or take too much work from students. To make substantive change, this effort will also require analysis of aggregate course-level data, especially for gateway courses, that report on the rates at which students succeed in the course, and whether all groups of students succeed on an equal basis. We ask every person on this campus to recognize that closing these gaps is a priority and a social justice and educational equity issue. We ask you to join us in this and work.&#160;</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to reduce the&#160;campus&#8217;s carbon footprint, a two-megawatt solar parking canopy will be built at the East Remote Parking Lot. The new Solar Photovoltaic system will project two-megawatts of&#160;power&#160;(off-setting approximately 20% of the PG&amp;E&#160;campus&#160;power&#160;demand). The&#160;campus&#160;must&#160;install and test equipment at Slug Substation for the new Solar Photovoltaic System. In order to complete this work a&#160;campus&#160;shut-down is required. On&#160;July&#160;11<sup>th</sup>&#160;to 12<sup>th</sup>&#160;and&#160;July&#160;25<sup>th</sup>&#160;to 26<sup>th</sup>&#160;the&#160;campus&#160;will be shut-down to install all the required equipment to connect the photovoltaic system to the&#160;campus&#160;grid and perform testing.</p>

He has served as the associate vice president for university advancement at Carnegie Mellon University since 2016, and directs CMU&#8217;s $2 billion comprehensive fundraising campaign.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>At Carnegie Mellon, Mark helped build the campaign infrastructure and oversaw the public launch. He coordinates campaign activities among CMU&#8217;s seven colleges and schools. Working closely with administrative and academic leaders as well as university trustees, he leads CMU&#8217;s efforts to identify strategic fundraising priorities, and develop and implement strategies for the campaign&#8217;s top donor prospects. CMU already has raised more than half of its campaign goal.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Mark has spent more than two decades in higher education administration with responsibility for driving a wide range of initiatives including executive communications, alumni relations, and development. He has served as senior adviser to two university presidents and has overseen enrollment management, international relations and campus master planning. He holds a master&#8217;s degree in International Relations from Tsinghua University (Beijing) and a bachelor&#8217;s degree from Northern Arizona University. His career-long commitment to UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Principles of Community are evident in his service on the CMU President&#8217;s Task Force on Campus Climate and as chair of University Advancement&#8217;s working group on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to interim Vice Chancellor for University Relations Jeff Shilling, who has led UR over the past year. Under his leadership, the University Relations team continues to build a strong foundation for the future, achieving in 2019-20 what will be one of our strongest fundraising years in recent history. Jeff will continue as the Associate Vice Chancellor for Philanthropy, a position he has held since 2010.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I also would like to thank the search committee for all of its work and flexibility, as it became necessary to complete this search remotely. Thank you, too, to the many members of our campus who provided feedback after meeting with candidates, contributing to this important search. Please join me in welcoming Mark and congratulating him on becoming a Banana Slug!</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="aab649848072701763b3cba658d71878"><name>announcing-the-appointment-of-cpevc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Announcing the appointment of Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor</title><summary>I am pleased to announce the appointment of Lori Kletzer as Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor.

She has served UC Santa Cruz as the interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor since July 2019. Lori has been a professor at UC Santa Cruz since 1992 and over that time has achieved acclaim in her field as a labor economist. Throughout her career, her research focus has been on the domestic labor market effects of globalization and policy responses. She has held a number of administrative positions on the UC Santa Cruz campus including acting and interim Dean of the Division of the Arts, Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies, Chair and Vice Chair of the Academic Senate, and Chair of the Economics Department.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>From 2010 to 2017, Lori served as the Provost and Dean of Faculty at Colby College, giving her keen insight into the strengths of a liberal arts education. At Colby, Lori developed and oversaw governmental and donor supported cluster hiring initiatives to build faculty strength in key areas. Over the course of her time in the role, she grew the faculty by 25% while enhancing institutional support for research and teaching through the establishment of a Center for Teaching and Learning and by creating partnerships with Maine-based non-profit research institutions.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This has been a difficult year for our campus and for our country. I am grateful to Lori for her leadership through the many challenges we faced this year and have found her to be a deep listener, a passionate advocate for our faculty, staff, and students, and a committed champion for change on our campus. As a campus, we have an opportunity to transform our university, to center real access and equity as the values of higher education, and to engage in genuine collaboration to shape the future of UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I would like to thank the search committee for all of its diligence and flexibility, especially as it became necessary to conduct the campus visit portion of this search remotely. I was gratified to see so much feedback on each of the candidates and such strong participation in the public sessions. Please join me in congratulating Lori. I am grateful she will continue in this role and continue the work we have begun.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b8d9cd418072701763b3cba661fa91e9"><name>maria-kerschen-in-memoriam</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Maria Kerschen (1955–2020)</title><summary>Maria Kerschen, who retired as assistant dean of planning and resource management from the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, passed away on May 22 in Eugene, Oregon.</summary><start-date>1592204400000</start-date><display-name>In Memoriam: Maria Kerschen (1955–2020)In Memoriam: Maria Kerschen (1955–2020)</display-name><path>/2020/06/maria-kerschen-in-memoriam</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/06/maria-kerschen-in-memoriam</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1592239181097</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1592254275432</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/06/images/maria-kerschen-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/06/images/maria-kerschen-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>maria-kerschen-350.jpg</name><display-name>maria-kerschen-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>72440</file-size><width>350</width><height>467</height></image><image-alt>Maria Kerschen</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/06/images/maria-kerschen-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/06/images/maria-kerschen-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>maria-kerschen-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>maria-kerschen-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>14478</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Maria Kerschen</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Maria Kerschen</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>With a heavy heart, I write to share the news that Maria Kerschen, who retired as assistant dean of planning and resource management from the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences just three years ago, passed away on May 22 in Eugene, Oregon. Maria was diagnosed with an inoperable cancer last August. Her sister Becky, also of Oregon, said she was doing relatively well but slipped away suddenly over the course of a week.</p>
<p>Maria worked for the University of California for 27 years. From 1990 to 1998, she rose through a series of positions at UC San Francisco, from an administrative assistant in the Department of Anatomy to the senior administrative analyst in the Cardiovascular Research Institute, overseeing a budget of $30 million. She moved to UC Santa Cruz in 1998 and worked in University Relations, ultimately as director of finance and information systems.</p>
<p>It was to the great benefit of our students, staff, and faculty that Maria accepted a position in the dean&#8217;s office in 2005. I first met her when I was a department chair and found her clear-headed, creative, and dedicated. When I was fortunate enough to be selected as dean of physical and biological sciences in 2011, I stepped into a high-functioning team with Maria and the other assistant deans, Kathie Kenyon and Nicolle Laird, and our acting director of development Lynne Stoops. This crew of powerful women was the only reason I figured out how to lead an organization as complicated as the science division. Dedicated staff and faculty at UC Santa Cruz who internalize, act on, and are energized by our mission to combine at-the-edge research with teaching that changes lives are the heart of this place. Maria embodied that ethos as much as anyone I&#8217;ve met in my nearly 25 years here.</p>
<p>Maria was passionate, driven, and incredibly effective when on the case, and everyone in the division was lucky we were one of her causes. She was hilarious and became more so as her retirement approached and some of her filters dropped in the face of typical university bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Maria had a colorful past that I only had glimpses of. She would drop enigmatic comments about her punk rock days in San Francisco in the late 1970s and early 1980s. She was Jerry Brown&#8217;s personal assistant when he was chairman of the California Democratic Party in the late 1980s, and perhaps unsurprisingly, she was an outspoken liberal. Her Buddhist practice stabilized her through life&#8217;s inevitable challenges. Her rich experiences shone through in her interactions with her friends and colleagues. I loved talking with Maria about gardens, food, books, art, music, cats and dogs, politics, being a mom, and so much more.</p>
<p>Maria was looking forward to raising hell over the things that mattered to her once she retired, and she began to do that in Oregon. She was active in combating gun violence. I just wish she had been given more time.</p>
<p>All of us here in the dean&#8217;s office send our condolences to Maria&#8217;s daughter Katherine, her sister Becky, the rest of her family, and to all of those who knew and loved her.</p>

Now, in the midst of a global pandemic, the center is set to answer even bigger questions.</article-subhead><article-text><p>The <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a> has embarked on a reimagining of its visitor experience that will set its path for the years ahead.</p>
<p>Even before the global pandemic forced governments, businesses, and other organizations to rethink operations, the center had laid the groundwork for comprehensive review of how it educates the community about the role scientific research plays in society&#8217;s understanding and conservation of the world&#8217;s oceans.</p>
<p>The center was forced to close its in-person visitor experiences in March, and these remain closed because of ongoing public health concerns. How the center fulfills its mission amid physical distancing and other requirements is one more question that will need to be answered by this planning effort, said Dan Costa, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS), which oversees the center.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Seymour Center has a bright future ahead,&#8221; said Costa. &#8220;The lasting challenges and changes to our world created by COVID-19 make this effort that much more important. I&#8217;m confident that the passion, creativity, and dedication from our community will show us the best path forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>The center is working with some of the nation&#8217;s leading museum experts to review the center&#8217;s exhibits, programming, and operations. The planning work is expected to conclude later this summer, at which point the center will have a strategic roadmap for future operations.</p>
<h2>A center in transition</h2>
<p>The strategic planning comes as the center&#8217;s founding executive director, Julie Barrett Heffington, retires after a 21-year career leading the center.</p>
<p>Heffington has led the center since before it first opened its doors in 2000. Under her leadership, the center has inspired people of all ages to preserve our oceans and coastal environment through its programs for schools, families, and individuals. She was <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2010/11/community-hero.html">honored in 2010</a> as a community hero for her leadership.</p>
<p>&#8220;Julie has made magic happen,&#8221; said Friends of Seymour Center board president Kim Steinhardt. &#8220;For the last 20 years, Julie has won the respect and admiration of all who have been touched by her determined campaign to build a community gem that embodies the best of education for all ages. The future of our ocean will be, in part, her legacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>A key piece of the new strategic plan will include hiring a new executive director who can lead the center for the years to come.</p>
<h2>Uncertainty amid COVID-19</h2>
<p>The Seymour Center shut its doors in mid-March, following Santa Cruz County&#8217;s public health orders to help limit the spread of COVID-19. The pandemic has placed a huge financial strain on the Seymour Center, the campus, and the University of California system.</p>
<p>Costa informed staff members on June 8 that the center&#8217;s operations would remain curtailed until the center can open safely&#8212;from the perspective of the university, the county, and most importantly worker safety&#8212;and can be assured that it will have sufficient visitor traffic to make opening viable.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my hope and wish that we will be able to re-open the center in the near future, but I&#8217;m unable to make any promises or projections on when this re-opening will be,&#8221; Costa said. &#8220;What I can promise is that I will do what I can to minimize the duration of the curtailment as much as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also said the campus had to make the difficult decision to lay off a significant portion of staff members at the Seymour Center. Across the United States, museums and galleries have also been forced to lay off large numbers of staff members because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>A few Seymour Center staff members will remain employed to keep the living exhibits safe, to offer online programming for K-12 students and the public, and to keep the center&#8217;s community engaged while the building is physically closed.</p>
<p>The center will continue to host its popular programs&#8212;Science Sundays, Labside Chats, and Creature Features&#8212;via YouTube and Zoom. Additionally, Virtual Ocean Explorers Summer Camps will begin June 22 at a reduced rate. More than 100 young participants will interact virtually with Long Marine Lab's resident marine mammals, learn from scientists, and take virtual field trips to ocean study sites nearby and as far away as Antarctica.</p>
<p><em>The Seymour Marine Discovery Center on the UC Santa Cruz coastal campus <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/get-involved/donate/">relies on public support</a> through admission fees, program fees, Ocean Discovery Shop sales, memberships, grants, and gifts from donors. While it is doing its best to reduce costs while it&#8217;s closed, gifts will help sustain parts of its program through this period.</em></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b9dc83288072701763b3cba616da90a7"><name>commencement-coverage-2020</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A commencement like no other at UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz students, faculty, and staff couldn't gather in mass on campus for this year's commencement celebrations.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time in the campus&#8217;s history, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s commencement festivities beamed their way through computer and smartphone screens, instead of taking place in real time on a field, a lawn, or the historic Quarry&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amphitheater.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of gathering in boisterous groups on the grass, students tuned in through laptops while sitting in apartments, taking part in dorm-room "watch parties," or hanging out in their kitchens.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of hugging and kissing their children and foisting balloons and flowers on them, proud parents sent heartfelt video greetings on Instagram.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;'Hey Grant,&#8217; &#8216;Hey Nick!,' &#8216;Hey Marisa!,&#8217; &#8216;Muchisimas felicidades,&#8217; &#8216;Hey, congratulations, you made it, kid!,&#8217; &#8216;You are a shining star that never stops shining!,&#8217;&#8217; Hard work pays off.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when that big moment came, and the ceremonies were wrapping up, students had to step outside or risk smacking their graduation caps against the ceiling after hurling them into the air.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, the threat of COVID-19 created some logistical issues, as well as an unprecedented reliance on technological innovations, making previous organizational questions&#8212;is the parking lot far from the ceremony? Did I bring enough sunscreen? Why are all the tent seats gone already?&#8212;seem simple and trivial in comparison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in spite of the non-analog quality of this year&#8217;s Zoomed and YouTubed ceremonies, there were still plenty of moving moments that were bound to get the tear ducts flowing&#8212;such as the time when Pablo Reguerin, associate vice chancellor Student Achievement &amp; Equity Innovation, told the students in the Chicanx Latinx Year End Celebration ceremony, &#8220;You are your ancestors&#8217; wildest dreams. You will continue their legacy by opening doors and bringing many more with you to this point and beyond.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those were the moments that kept the ceremonies real and grounded, even when the well-wishers were far away from one another.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty and students kept repeating a powerful and simple message to the roughly 3,300 undergraduates and 208 graduate students who had applied to graduate this spring: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">this is a landmark moment in your lifetime. Make sure to stop and take this in, wherever you are. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz Econ Grad Video included a brief but heartfelt exhortation from Assistant Economics Professor Brenda Samaniego De La Parra:&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a fantastic accomplishment. You should be extremely proud of yourselves. I hope you realize that, and I hope to hear about all the great things you will accomplish in the future.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Stay motivated!&#8221; said Economics Professor Justin Marion, all decked out in red robes and a black cap. &#8220;Stay positive!&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Making the most of it</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, UC Santa Cruz has a long history of making the most out of unusual and adverse circumstances and improvising solutions on the spot; this, after all, is the same campus that once housed its student population in trailers on fields full of rocks and dirt piles, and held some of its classes in the East Field House in 1965.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the UC Santa Cruz community did much more than just adapt to this time of necessary caution. They also made the very best of it, using online platforms to convey the same warmth, intimacy, creativity, and activist spirit that characterizes analog commencement ceremonies every year, while making room for a touch of Sammy the Slug&#8211;style gleeful eccentricity.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A short video introducing the Cowell College ceremony showed graduates dancing with their dogs, as well as a scene in which a student discovers a rolled-up college diploma hiding in a shrub underneath a presidential campaign sign reading, &#8220;Any functioning adult, 2020."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celebrants conveyed their pride and a strong sense of place. Students in various colleges filmed each other dancing in clouds of confetti and waggling hand-made signs, while </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakes commencement students extended greetings and warm congratulations to the graduates in English, Tagalog, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Amharic, Urdu, Vietnamese, and Hindi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakes College Provost and Associate Professor of Feminist Studies Marcia Ochoa urged graduates to picture the places they missed, and take in the pride and love of their families and friends, even if those people were far away.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now the Quarry is quiet and the (Oakes) lower lawn is empty," Ochoa said. &#8220;This morning, two coyotes were just hanging out. The field is closed now, so all I can do is look out across it and remember the joy of a sunny day in June, with sweeping views of the Monterey Bay.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ochoa urged viewers to picture &#8220;family, little siblings, aunties, grandmas, and decorated mortarboards held down with hot glue and bobby pins, at impossible angles. I want you to close your eyes and imagine the look of pride on your favorite instructor or staff member seeing you in your robes. Imagine them on that sunny day all around you. Even though you have been deprived of that moment right now, we at Oakes want you to know that we see you shining in that sunlight.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Raising their voices for change</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ceremonies also took place in front of a backdrop of dissent, with protests that have swelled across America after the brutal killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man, while in police custody in Minneapolis in May.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the 45th annual Black Grad Ceremony, keynote speaker Moses Massenburg (College Ten '11, sociology), a doctoral student at the Department of History at Michigan State University, delivered his message from his family home in Watts. Though he mentioned the almost constant presence of helicopters and police sirens in his neighborhood, as well as airplane traffic in and out of Los Angeles International Airport, &#8220;The noise pollution around me is nothing compared to the noise pollution we are currently enduring as black people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In ghettos across America, black people are struggling for survival now," he said. &#8220;(But) we have assets, you and I. We graduated from UC Santa Cruz. We are alumni now. And there&#8217;s power in that &#8230; All you beautiful, powerful students have joined the ranks of the great alumni who are making this world a better place.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He read a list of African American alumni names including Abraham Jones (College Ten '12, community studies), now a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Colorado, and the high-profile activist </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/08/rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-loftin.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiffany Loftin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakes '11, political science), who then&#8211;President Barack Obama appointed in 2015 to the President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for African Americans, which focuses on improving student achievement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Devin Virassammy (Oakes '20, engineering) addressed nationwide protests in his student keynote remarks for the Jack Baskin School of Engineering&#8217;s commencement ceremony.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The fault lines and divisions in our country grew sharper and deeper," said Virassammy. &#8220;As the son of immigrants &#8230; I often wonder, when I am stopped by an officer, if all the plans I have made beyond college would instead be replaced by my name as a hashtag on Twitter.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virassammy ended on a message of urgent change. He urged the newly minted alumni to raise their voices and speak out against injustice.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need your voices," he said. &#8220;With our generation lies the challenge and the chance to advance the cause for equality, justice, and the right to breath. The greatest challenge of the century is not only to eradicate COVID-19, get back to the moon, or fix the damaged climate, but how we involve our society&#8217;s underfunded, underrepresented, and forgotten peoples. With us lies the opportunity to create the world we want to live in."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a student researcher in the lab of assistant professor of biomolecular engineering Daniel Kim, Virassammy studied how to determine whether cancer patients were suitable for anti-cancer treatment. After graduation, he plans to start a company with a group of undergraduates who are currently working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to convert plastic waste into energy sources.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Transforming lives and sharing stories</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="#https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/year-of-alumni-grande-reyna.html">Award-winning novelist and memoirist Reyna Grande</a> (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kresge '99, creative writing, film and video), author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Distance Between Us</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Dream Called Home,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> urged Kresge graduates to &#8220;cling to your dreams and don&#8217;t let go.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To receive my university diploma was one of the proudest days of my life,&#8221; said Grande, who comes from the state of Guerrero, the second-poorest state in Mexico. &#8220;When we immigrated to the United States, my father was determined that his children get an education. He demanded perfect grades and attendance from us. One of the things I loved about my father was, he was a big dreamer. His dream became my dreams.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At UC Santa Cruz, Grande started out feeling scared and isolated, with times of doubt. But she had a strong drive to write stories celebrating her culture. She longed to use her creativity and talent to transform herself and her world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You can do this, too, by staying focused,&#8217;&#8217; she said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let anybody take your dreams away from you.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ba02ddcd8072701763b3cba69730dd64"><name>sab-elections-open</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>SAB Elections Open</title><summary>We are pleased to announce the elections for next year's Staff Advisory Board.

<p>&#160;</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>UC Santa Cruz will present the premiere of thesis films by nine graduating M.F.A. students in the field of social documentation this year&#8212;in a special online presentation from June 15 to August 31.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The documentaries that will be screened are the culmination of an&#160;intense two years of immersion in the art of documentary media and craft, scholarly research and&#160;analysis, nonfiction storytelling, and the politics of representation.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the most innovative and progressive programs in the Arts Division, the&#160;Film and Digital Media Department&#8217;s&#160;masters program in Social Documentation (SocDoc) is designed for future documentarians committed to social change and to documenting communities, cultures, issues, and individuals.</span></p>
<p><span>Founded in 2005, SocDoc has a vision of documentation that sets it apart from more traditional approaches to the genre. The program is designed to prepare students for careers in independent media, documentary filmmaking, human rights work, and contributions to a wide range of other creative fields.</span></p>
<p><span>Students are encouraged to &#8220;go beyond the story,&#8221; and take a deep dive into their subject matter in the pursuit of the underlying causes of social injustice, with a personal commitment to telling the stories that are often ignored and unheard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>This year marks the 14th anniversary of the annual thesis film screenings from the masters program in Social Documentation.</span></p>
<p><span>And as film and digital media graduate program coordinator Rachel Grad notes: &#8220;This online screening presents an incredible access opportunity for anyone interested in knowing the issues and topics on the minds of the newest up-and-coming documentary filmmakers of our time.&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Here are the M.F.A. thesis films from the class of 2020:</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Kyle Baker<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><em>The Eighth Province</em><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>In Bakersfield, California, Basque immigrants dedicate themselves to sustaining their language, music, and labor traditions. Generational ties are tested as musical traditions dwindle, labor conditions transform, and a community strives to maintain a sense of cultural identity in the modern day.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span><strong>Carlos Campos</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span><em>Campos de Sue&#241;os-Fields of Dreams</em><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Campos de Sue&#241;os is a short documentary centered around the dreams of community members in Watsonville, Ca, who utilize soccer and recreation as the inspiration of who they are or who they will become.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Melanie Dang Ho<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></strong></p>
<p><em>s&#244;&#769;ng &#417;&#777; &#273;&#226;y | to live here<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></em></p>
<p><span>Exploring the intimacy of the mundane, s&#244;&#769;ng &#417;&#777; &#273;&#226;y focuses on the lives of Vietnamese shrimpers and elderly farmers in New Orleans, understanding the reverberations of the past, present in day-to-day labor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Jeanne Rachel Lieberman<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Desiertos Verdes<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></em></p>
<p><span>Desiertos Verdes paints a portrait of an Afro-Colombian community&#8217;s&#160;struggle to maintain their agency, autonomy and territory in the face of widespread dispossession at the hands of ever-expanding sugar production.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Mahshid Modares<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Sanctions on the Sky<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></em></p>
<p><span>Sanctions on the Sky explores the unbearable living conditions created for Iranian families under U.S. sanctions, specifically for those who have lost a loved one in airplane crashes during the past 40 years. The film investigates the context created by the sanctions in terms of Iran's aviation industry through the story of a woman whose husband died in an airplane crash. Her story is followed by the work of an Iranian/American journalism professor and several short interviews with Iranians who share their concerns with the viewers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Brian Myers<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Far From Kawthoolei<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></em></p>
<p><span>The U.S. has welcomed over 160,000 refugees from Burma (Myanmar). Amongst them are the Karen, an indigenous people whose homeland of Kawthoolei is in the eastern highlands of the post-colonial state of Burma. When the military junta came to power, the Karen were forced from their villages to refugee camps across the border in Thailand. A new generation is born in America that hasn&#8217;t experienced the trauma of war crimes or the affinity that has bonded a people to fight for self-determination. Far From Kawthoolei reveals how identities may adapt and persevere when uprooted from geography, history, and politics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Deepika Shrestha Ross<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><em>Momo America</em><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Momo America is a documentary short film that seeks to expand the Asian American narrative by providing an insider&#8217;s view into the largely invisible Nepali American immigrant experience. The narrator&#8217;s personal story, built of memories, family photographs, and home video, provides the framework through which are woven present-day vignettes of a growing and increasingly diverse Nepali American population, finding community and passing on cultural knowledge--all around the kitchen table, while exchanging stories and preparing one of their favorite foods, momos.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Boris Yaikin C.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></strong></p>
<p><em>The Songwriter&#8217;s Mission<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></em></p>
<p><span>After more than 45 years working in San Francisco's Mission neighborhood, Francisco Herrera continues to lead the social struggles of immigrants and Latino workers with his music and community organizing. Recognized within the local community as a "Latino Folk Hero," Francisco represents the mestizo spirit of his community--the racial or ethnic mixed ancestry that combines American Indian and European descent, and the current struggles and contradictions inflicted on the neighborhood by gentrification.&#160;</span><span>The Songwriter&#8217;s Mission uses verit&#233; shooting and animation inspired by Latino street art and American superhero pop culture to depict these colorful battles as we accompany Francisco in his daily activities as an organizer and explore the intimacy of his home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Andr&#233;s Camacho<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Open Line</em></p>
<p><span>2019 was another banner year for commercial salmon fishermen in Alaska's Bristol Bay. But the abundance of fish is deceptive. While families submit to the tides&#8212;hauling their nets by hand, day or night&#8212;to harvest the greatest migration of wild salmon in the world, the local radio station&#8217;s daily call-in program reveals an impassioned debate over a proposed open-pit copper mine that threatens the future of the fishery.</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alyssa Tamboura&#8217;s father went to prison when she was 9 years old, and, for 10 of the 13 years he was behind bars, she blamed him for abandoning her to what she said was life in an abusive household where she eventually dropped out of high school and landed on the streets. She was filled with rage toward him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She could have stayed angry. She could have done nothing. Instead, the 26-year-old legal studies and philosophy major at UC Santa Cruz started a project designed to help families touched by incarceration heal from the same issues of hurt and anger she experienced. Called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walls to Bridges</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the student-run, volunteer program relies on mediated meetings between those jailed and their families as a way to work their way back to better relationships. It was funded with a $15,000 grant from the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Donald A. Strauss Foundation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and won a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rudd Family Foundation Big Ideas award through UC Berkeley. I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ts team is doing remote mediations until pandemic restrictions ease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The rupturing of relationships that&#160;occurs with a prison sentence, the pain and grief and anger that continues to radiate out from this&#8212;these are devastating issues, but they are largely ignored by the outside world,&#8221; said Elizabeth Beaumont, associate politics professor at UC Santa Cruz and one of Tamboura&#8217;s mentors. &#8220;So, Alyssa's work to address the hidden tragedy of families riven by incarceration, to create bridges within families, and bridges from those within prison to the world outside, is absolutely vital.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tamboura described her home life after her father left as a troubled one. There were substance abuse issues, she said, and, after she was thrown out of the house, she was forced to couch surf or sleep in cars. Pregnant at 16, she dropped out of high school and gave birth to a son. She had no contact with her father, who was first in California State Prison, Corcoran, and then San Quentin State Prison.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was so angry at my dad for what felt like him abandoning me,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 19, and now a single mom, she decided she was going to confront her father. She spent the whole drive to San Quentin imagining how she would lay into him, reciting a litany of what he&#8217;d done wrong and how much he hurt her.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And then he comes into the visiting room,&#8221; she said by phone. &#8220;He stops, looks at me, and gives me a big hug. I start crying and he says, &#8216;I&#8217;m so sorry that I left you.&#8217; My father took responsibility for how his incarceration caused conflict in our relationship.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It changed everything. They began to talk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 20, Tamboura was back at San Quentin, this time to witness her father graduate with a two-year associate&#8217;s degree and as valedictorian of his small class. She thought, &#8220;if my dad in prison could do it, get an education, so could I.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tamboura received her GED, found a job as an administrative assistant at Stanford Medical School, and enrolled in Foothill Community College while also raising her son. When she came to UC Santa Cruz, she said, she thought she&#8217;d found a place &#8220;where I could finally pursue my dreams, be myself and breathe.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was there, in 2018, that Beaumont, her professor, offered students in her civil liberties course extra credit for attending a restorative justice forum at the Resource Center for Nonviolence in downtown Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restorative justice involves a meeting&#8212;often mediated&#8212;between a victim and perpetrator in which experiences are shared and they come to a consensus of what can be done to repair the damage caused. After the forum was over, Tamboura thought, &#8220;Wow, this is such a great process of bringing two people together to talk about any harm or conflict in their relationship and find a way to resolve it. I thought it would be beneficial to start a project so people impacted by incarceration could have access to this healing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She applied for and got the $15,000 grant, found and set up training for volunteers, received support from the Conflict Resolution Center Santa Cruz, and started to recruit families when the COVID-19 pandemic stalled the project. She is now preparing a written &#8220;toolkit&#8221; of procedures and processes to run the program so that when she graduates in 2021 with her College Ten classmates, someone else can take the program&#8217;s reins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Alyssa is a force of nature,&#8221; Beaumont said. &#8220;I really don&#8217;t know how she does it all&#8212;a star student, a devoted single mother, and a visionary leader for this project. And on top of it all, she&#8217;s also such a warm and generous friend. Certainly, part of the magic is that she&#8217;s tremendously smart, with so much curiosity. And she doesn&#8217;t just dive into learning inside the classroom, but she carries it back and forth beyond these walls.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tamboura, she added, &#8220;contributes to a remarkable tradition of courageous and impactful student activism at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tamboura, whose son, Christopher, is now 9, also wrote and is publishing a children&#8217;s book about visiting a parent in prison; recently won the Phi Beta Kappa&#8217;s Key into Public Service national scholarship; was awarded UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Gabriel Zimmerman Scholarship last year; and plans to go to law school after she graduates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everything I&#8217;ve been through has led me to this moment,&#8221; Tamboura said, &#8220;and, in this moment, I see that I am now in a position to help people who are suffering the way I was suffering.&#8221; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="be8dbddf8072701763b3cba64f21afb7"><name>library-journal</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Springer Nature open access agreement and Elsevier update</title><summary>In the midst of what have been difficult times, I am pleased to share some very good news.

<p>Under the agreement, all articles with a UC corresponding author published in more than 2,700 of Springer Nature&#8217;s journals will be open access by default, with the UC Libraries paying a portion of the open access fee on behalf of all authors. Authors without available research funds for the remainder of the publishing fee can request that the library cover the entire amount. Authors may also choose to opt out of open access publishing if they wish. While broad-based open access publishing in the most well-known Nature journals is not initially included, the deal commits Springer Nature and UC to collaborating on an open science pilot in 2021 and developing plans for a transformative agreement for all of the Nature journals to be implemented in the third year of the agreement.</p>
<p>The deal also includes reading access and perpetual rights to more than 1,000 journals in Springer Nature&#8217;s portfolio to which UC did not previously subscribe.</p>
<p>The open access publishing provisions will go into effect once the formal agreement has been signed and will run through 2023. More details are available on the <a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/uc-publisher-relationships/springer-nature-transformative-open-access-agreement/">UC&#8217;s Office of Scholarly Communication website</a>.</p>
<h3>Elsevier update</h3>
<p>UC&#8217;s negotiating team continues to communicate with Elsevier. While progress remains slow, there are a number of recent developments that we hope may give fresh impetus to these discussions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>COVID&#8211;19:</strong> As a recent Los Angeles Times <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-03-03/covid-19-open-science">column</a> laid out, the need for access to research has never been clearer. In fact, many publishers, including Elsevier, have temporarily made coronavirus-related articles freely available. Pandemic-related budget crunches may also pressure publishers to moderate financial demands.</li>
<li><strong>Federal policy:</strong> The Office of Science and Technology Policy is considering a zero-embargo policy for the author&#8217;s final manuscript for all federally funded research &#8212; a change strongly <a href="https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/reports/kkb-jn-open-access-embargo-ostp-rfi-2020.pdf">supported</a> by UC&#8217;s faculty Senate and that, if adopted, would further incentivize publishers to accelerate their shift towards open access.</li>
<li><strong>Actions by other institutions:</strong> UNC-Chapel Hill, Iowa State University and the SUNY (State University of New York) system all recently ended their &#8220;big deal&#8221; subscription packages with Elsevier. As the head of UNC&#8217;s university library <a href="https://library.unc.edu/2019/03/statement-uc-elsevier/">wrote</a>: &#8220;UC helped to expose the runaway journal costs that are breaking university and library budgets everywhere [and] the need to increase open access to research, rather than locking it behind steep and rising paywalls.&#8221; And just last week MIT ended its negotiations with Elsevier after the publisher failed to present a proposal that aligned with MIT&#8217;s open access principles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, the feedback we received from faculty, students and researchers earlier this year confirmed that, while researchers are feeling the impact of UC&#8217;s lack of an Elsevier contract &#8212; particularly in the health and life sciences &#8212; the majority both systemwide and here at UC Santa Cruz remain supportive of UC&#8217;s position.</p>
<p>While we don&#8217;t yet know what form the final resolution with Elsevier will take, UC remains committed to getting closure and finding a path forward in the coming months.</p>
<h3>Moving forward</h3>
<p>The new Springer Nature agreement &#8212; the largest open access agreement in North America to date &#8212; is an exciting note on which to end the year. Over the course of the year, UC has also implemented four other transformative open access agreements, with a diverse range of publishers &#8212; <a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/uc-publisher-relationships/cambridge-transformative-oa-agreement/">Cambridge University Press</a>, society publisher <a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/uc-publisher-relationships/acm-transformative-oa-agreement/">ACM</a>, and native open access publishers <a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/uc-publisher-relationships/jmir-oa-agreement/">JMIR</a> and <a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/uc-publisher-relationships/plos-oa-agreement/">PLoS</a>) &#8212; and conversations with other publishers are still underway.</p>
<p>Together, these deals demonstrate the broad potential of UC&#8217;s approach to transform scholarly publishing in the United States to a sustainable, open access model, and to provide broad public access to the fruits of UC&#8217;s research.</p>
<p>We will continue to keep you apprised of any new agreements or other notable developments. If you have questions, please don&#8217;t hesitate to contact research@library.ucsc.edu at any time.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bed6e5218072701763b3cba620285214"><name>juneteenth-celebration</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus to celebrate Juneteenth</title><summary>Juneteenth is the oldest known celebration commemorating the end of slavery in the United States. </summary><start-date>1592290800000</start-date><display-name>Juneteenth celebration</display-name><path>/2020/06/juneteenth-celebration</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/06/juneteenth-celebration</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1592339653891</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1592345527478</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/06/images/juneteenth.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/06/images/juneteenth.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>juneteenth.jpg</name><display-name>juneteenth.jpg</display-name><file-size>862804</file-size><width>1650</width><height>2550</height></image><image-alt>Juneteenth flier</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz will celebrate Juneteenth&#8212;the oldest known celebration commemorating the ending of slavery&#8212;from noon to 1:15 p.m. on June 19 <a href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/j/91740684682">via Zoom</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>Organized by Staff Human Resources, the event is open to everyone in the campus community.&#160;</p>
<p>On June 19, 1865, Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, landed at Galveston, Texas with news that the war had ended and that the enslaved were now free, according to Juneteenth.com. This&#160;was two and a half years after President Lincoln&#8217;s Emancipation Proclamation, which had become official January 1, 1863.</p>
<p>The Emancipation Proclamation had little impact on the Texans due to the minimal number of Union troops to enforce the new Executive Order. However, with the surrender of General Lee in April of 1865, and the arrival of General Granger&#8217;s regiment, the forces were finally strong enough to influence and overcome the resistance.</p>

These plans include instruction; student housing and dining; as well as student programs and services. Provisions for symptom checks, temperature checking and virus testing are being developed in alignment with guidance from public health officials.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Fall Instruction</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>When fall quarter instruction begins October 1, UC Santa Cruz will offer most courses remotely or online and provide in-person instruction for a small number of courses that cannot be delivered remotely, as is the case for some laboratory, studio and field study courses. Each course will have the mode of instruction listed within the schedule of courses, available </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pisa.ucsc.edu/class_search/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1592510026254000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFgv7es2mtm0MKyNH4g_2nyGPFEVA" href="https://pisa.ucsc.edu/class_search/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Whether in-person or remote, we are committed to the values of fostering community, ensuring accessibility, and facilitating deep learning across and beyond the academic curriculum.&#160; Instructors, supported by specialists in teaching and learning, will be working throughout the summer to redesign courses for remote or fully online delivery. Our in-person instruction and learning spaces will be modified as necessary to ensure that we comply with physical distancing and other public health measures. We continue to draw on the expertise of our students to support remote instruction. This spring quarter&#8217;s &#8220;Zoom Corps&#8221; of student workers lending technical expertise in online classrooms will continue through Summer and Fall. They will be joined by a new &#8220;Accessibility Corps&#8221; of student workers helping make sure all course materials are accessible to all of our students. We encourage you to visit our </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://keeplearning.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1592510026254000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE4urkTTJqDm8Nsyh9Aumi2fVQJug" href="https://keeplearning.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Keep Learning</span></a><span> page that provides further information about self-care, connection, remote learning strategies, advising and many other resources.&#160;</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Planning with Flexibility in Mind</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>With fall instruction scheduled to start later than at some universities, the campus will have additional time to monitor the pandemic and make preparations for fall. As the pandemic and public health guidance evolve, UC Santa Cruz will evolve too, working in close collaboration with public health officials and experts throughout the UC system.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We must remain flexible and keep campus health and access for all as our guiding priorities. Current plans for in-person classes in fall may need to be adjusted or cancelled to comply with changing external guidelines or our own UC Santa Cruz health and safety evaluations. For example, due to public health concerns around holiday travel, instructors may be asked to complete their in-person sessions prior to the Thanksgiving break, following which all instruction and final exams would be remote. And should it become necessary, the campus is prepared to return to the current state of reduced on-site operations at any time.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The university will develop accommodations to support students who, due to personal circumstances or elevated health risks associated with COVID-19, are unable to return to campus for the fall quarter. Academic advisors will work with those whose majors require the courses being offered only in-person, so that students can continue to make progress toward their degrees.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Housing and Dining</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The residential housing and dining experience will be modified to accommodate current public health guidance. Rooms will be configured as singles and doubles only, significantly reducing our overall housing capacity. Given limitations in housing capacity, placement in university housing accommodations will be prioritized for various continuing student populations and new transfer students, who may have a need to be physically present for courses or labs taught on campus. Additional students will be accommodated, space permitting. More information will be forthcoming from Housing in the coming days.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Students who are taking all courses remotely and who have a safe place to live and learn should strongly consider refraining from seeking an on-campus residence. We ask that all first-year students consider postponing their move onto campus until we are able to accommodate a higher density in housing. The college core course as well as most lower division coursework will be offered remotely, thereby enabling all first-year students to begin their studies at home. We are working to establish a vibrant remote first-year experience, thereby connecting first-year students with college communities and classmates before physically coming to campus. You are all an important part of our community and it is vital that we connect with you as our incoming Banana Slug cohort - </span><span>Class of 2024</span><span>!&#160;</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Focus on the Student Experience</span></h2>

<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Planning for a Healthy Campus&#160;</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As we plan for fall 2020 and the 2020-21 academic year, reducing the spread of COVID-19 remains a top priority, and we are continuously evaluating how we can best achieve this goal. In collaboration with the campus Molecular Diagnostic Lab, the Cowell Student Health Center has been testing students who are exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19. The campus will continue to test symptomatic students this fall.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The campus has also instituted protocols to reduce COVID-19 spread on campus, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Asking all students, employees, and guests/visitors to wear face coverings</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Minimizing the density of people on-site at all UCSC owned or leased properties</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Implementing building control measures, such as physical distancing in all campus classrooms and learning spaces</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Increasing sanitization&#160;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Requiring training for all employees before they return to on-site work and requiring training for students before they return to campus for fall quarter</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Continuing remote work arrangements for many employees</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Requiring worksite plans before employees return to on-site work</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Requiring daily, self-administered symptom checks for all employees and student employees who are coming into a UCSC owned or leased property</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Supporting our Community</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Whether in-person or remote, the equity and justice issues that have animated the past several weeks of protest in our country and throughout our campus continue to evolve. During uncertain times, fear can lead us to communicate and behave in biased and exclusionary ways, creating further fear and pain. However, our Banana Slug community has shown time and time again our remarkable capacity to actively engage in community building to keep each other healthy and to ensure that each person on our campus has the opportunity to succeed. Now more than ever, we must actively engage in the work of community building in pursuit of our individual and collective goals.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Thank you for your flexibility and adaptability as we work together to continue our mission of teaching, learning, research and public service.</span></p>

Alinder will begin Aug. 15.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Alinder joins us from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where she is a professor of history and associate dean of the humanities in the College of Letters and Science, a position she has held since 2017. Dr. Alinder has served in a number of administrative roles at UWM, among them director of urban studies, and coordinator of public history for the History Department. In her position as associate dean, she oversees budgets, personnel, hiring, academic program initiatives, scheduling, facilities, and research support for nine departments, five centers, three interdepartmental degree programs, more than a dozen certificate programs, Milwaukee Public Radio, and the Mathis Art Gallery. As director of urban studies, she oversaw a set of interdisciplinary degree programs that include an undergraduate major, certificate, M.S. and Ph.D. As coordinator of public history, she worked with graduate students as an adviser, many of whom specialized in museum studies. Her service beyond the university has focused on using the public humanities to bridge divides between the university and community, to create alliances with state and federal governments, agencies, businesses, and nonprofits.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Alinder is an interdisciplinary, community-engaged scholar and teacher of public history, the history of photography, and the history of Japanese-Americans during World War II. As a historian of photography, her research investigates what she characterizes as &#8220;the presumptive right to the camera.&#8221; She earned her doctorate in the history of art at the University of Michigan, with an emphasis on the history of photography, her M.A. in art history at the University of New Mexico, and an A.B. in art history from Princeton University.&#160;<br/><br/>I would like to thank the search committee for its hard work, collaboration, and flexibility, particularly with the need to conduct campus visits via remotely. Participation in the public sessions was strong, and the feedback useful. Please join me in congratulating Dr. Alinder and in welcoming her to our community. I look forward to working with her. &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tyler Stovall informed me of his decision to step down as humanities dean this past fall, and during the winter quarter we launched the national search that brought us Dr. Alinder. Dean Stovall has notified me that he has accepted the position of dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Fordham University and that he is formally retiring from UC Santa Cruz.<br/><br/>I would like to offer my appreciation to Tyler for his contributions to campus. He began his tenure as dean here in 2014, coming from UC Berkeley, where he was a professor of French history and dean of the undergraduate division of the College of Letters and Science. Tyler&#8217;s arrival in 2014 was a return, not a new beginning. He had previously spent 13 years as a faculty member in the History Department, and he had served as provost of Stevenson College.&#160;<br/><br/>Tyler is an accomplished scholar, the author of four books, several co-edited volumes, numerous journal articles, and several textbooks. He is a past president of the American Historical Association. On our campus, Tyler has been a strong supporter of The Humanities Institute, and it has developed greatly during his deanship. It serves as a model for advancing student and faculty research and for creating unique events that engage the broader community in questions that matter to us all<br/><br/>A commitment to social justice is central to Tyler&#8217;s life and career, and I have always found him to be collegial and thoughtful about humanities education. His last day at UCSC is June 30. Please join me in wishing Tyler well.<br/><br/>Carla Freccero, distinguished professor of Literature and History of Consciousness, and affiliated faculty in Feminist Studies, will serve as interim dean. She joined our faculty in 1991 and currently serves as chair of the Literature Department. Trained as a Renaissance scholar, she is the author of several books and numerous articles on topics ranging from early modern literature to feminist queer theory and animal studies. She is also principal investigator of The Humanities Institute research cluster on Speculatively Scientific Fictions of the Future. I&#8217;m delighted she has agreed to serve campus in this interim capacity.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz community</audience><admin>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c4bc35d28072701763b3cba6249a2228"><name>massoud-endert</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Allison Endert</title><start-date>1592377200000</start-date><display-name>Massoud-Endert</display-name><path>/2020/06/massoud-endert</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/06/massoud-endert</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1592438568373</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1592438688930</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Politics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>With tremendous sorrow we write of the death this week of Allison Endert, 44, in Santa Cruz.

<p>For Carrie Partch, UC Santa Cruz associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry, one of those students is Alfred Freeberg, this year&#8217;s winner of the prestigious Steck Family Award. The award is given for an outstanding senior research project chosen from 15 Chancellor Awards projects.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alfred is in this rare class &#8211; a few students that I&#8217;ve had that have wowed me with their perseverance and creativity and spirit in the lab,&#8221; Partch said.</p>
<p>Freeberg assisted in the Partch lab&#8217;s study of the molecular basis for circadian rhythms - biological processes that occur naturally in line with the Earth&#8217;s 24-hour daily rotation cycle.</p>
<p>He said he was blown away that he received the award, which comes with a $1,000 prize. &#8220;I was very surprised and felt honored and lucky to have these experiences,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He praised Partch for being a wonderful mentor and a world-class researcher who is committed to diversity in education.</p>
<p>Raised in Napa, Freeberg grew up playing in the woods and became interested in science through his love of nature. He was fascinated by the complexity of all facets of nature and its ecosystems and wanted to learn more.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, Freeberg assisted in research that dealt with the reasons for differences in people&#8217;s sleep cycles. Most people have an internal clock matching that 24-hour Earth cycle that causes them to get tired around 10 or 11 p.m. and wake up around 7 or 8 a.m., while others have a cellular variant that causes their clock to run on a shorter 20-hour cycle. These &#8220;extreme morning larks&#8221; are usually wide awake at 3 or 4 a.m. and fall asleep at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Freeberg and his graduate student mentor in the lab discovered that the CK1 protein has a tiny switch that controls the clock timing. People with shorter cycles have their switch locked into the &#8220;on&#8221; position, said Partch.</p>
<p>Freeberg was listed as the second author of a long list of contributors in a report about the research. An unexpected honor came when Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, featured the study in his blog. People who have the shorter 20-hour clock live with constant jet-lag and can have metabolic, cardiovascular and other behavioral disorders. Partch said the research Freeberg worked on is an important first step in possibly developing drugs that could help people adjust those cycles.</p>
<p>Freeberg plans to apply for acceptance in a PhD program in possibly circadian biology or biochemistry this fall. In the meantime, he will continue to work in Partch&#8217;s lab.</p>
<p>He said the COVID&#8211;19 pandemic and recent protests for racial justice are causing him to consider his values and how they apply to his career choice. While science is an amazing way to understand the world, it is also apolitical, which has both good and bad points. &#8220;It almost feels like putting your head in the sand,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s considering the morality of his possible career choices, and is asking himself: &#8220;How does science fit into the society I want to be part of and contribute to?&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c8b1df2e8072701763b3cba673beaa11"><name>parking-permit-requirement-and-renewal-app-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Parking Permit Requirement and Renewal/Application Update</title><summary>Beginning July 1, 2020, all parking on campus will require the display of an appropriate, valid permit or placard, or a virtual permit payment.</summary><start-date>1592463600000</start-date><display-name>Parking Permit Requirement and Renewal/Application Update</display-name><path>/2020/06/parking-permit-requirement-and-renewal-app-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/06/parking-permit-requirement-and-renewal-app-update</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1592504999679</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1592505231359</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><strong>Beginning July 1, 2020, all parking on campus will require the display of an appropriate, valid permit or placard, or a virtual permit payment.</strong><span> If you are returning to work or classes during the summer months, you may </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://taps.ucsc.edu/parking/parking-permits/application-instructions.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1592587110617000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHybH4cCTGJ8KmI8A8J2jtjc304hQ" href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/parking/parking-permits/application-instructions.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>apply for or renew a permit online</span></a><span>. </span><strong>Current Multi-Year A Permits do not expire until the end of calendar year 2020</strong><span>, but you may choose to renew at this time as well.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>

This decision reflects the hard work and dedication of so many people, and we are proud that the University of California led the fight to preserve this crucial policy. The rights ensured by DACA are critically important, and we are relieved that they have not been arbitrarily taken from people who are vital to our community and contribute so much to it.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>While today&#8217;s decision is certainly a relief, DACA is not enough. It only provides work authorization for people who came to the United States as children and requires renewal every two years. It does not provide a path to citizenship. Most importantly, many undocumented&#160; people are excluded from DACA and cannot benefit from the legal protections it affords.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To our undocumented community: Know that we will continue to welcome you and value you at UC Santa Cruz without regard to immigration status. We see your humanity, your talents, and your contributions to our university and the world. This will never change.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Many students already lacked DACA protection, and we have worked hard to ensure they have the same opportunities as other students. We know that more is needed, now more than ever. </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://eop.ucsc.edu/undocumented_student_services/campus-updates.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1592593813744000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFNrg_TQxfrsEqR7szB5uYfyDcmMw" href="https://eop.ucsc.edu/undocumented_student_services/campus-updates.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>This continuously updated page</span></a><span> summarizes the university&#8217;s most recent work to support the undocumented student community. In addition, below you will find information about resources available to undocumented students. At the urging of our students, particularly our undocumented student community, we are also creating a space in the Academic Resources Center exclusively dedicated to Undocumented Student Services.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Over their lives, our undocumented community members have shown incredible courage and resilience, overcoming many barriers to achieve so much. We all share in the relief of this decision, but know there is much more work to do. We will continue to do all we can to make our community inclusive, to advocate for humane comprehensive immigration reform, and to support our undocumented undergraduate and graduate students, staff, faculty and their families in achieving their educational goals.</span></p>

<p>&#160;That&#8217;s why he and his brother, David, decided last year to put a stylized picture of a viral protein on their new bottles of &#8220;<span><a href="https://shop.michaeldavidwinery.com/product/2018-GOING-VIRAL-MERLOT-12/750ML">Going Viral&#8221; Merlot</a></span>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Capturing the atomic view of the fight between humans and viruses, 'Going Viral' embodies Dr. Phillips-DuBois's passion in developing new vaccines and antiviral therapies to cure childhood infections,&#8221; according to their company&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>&#160;The design was a striking and refreshing alternative to the imagery of forests, antlers, and mountain glens that make so many bottle labels so sleepy, safe, and boring.</p>
<p>But the timing turned out to be a huge problem.&#160;</p>
<p>Just before they were going to release their &#8220;Going Viral&#8221; wine this year, the COVID-19 epidemic swept the world. Michael and David were in a bind. What if wine buyers thought the Phillipses were using the virus protein as a glib reference to a global tragedy? What if connoisseurs mistakenly believed the brothers were trying to capitalize on a pandemic?</p>
<p>&#8220;My family realized, there was no way they could release the wine,&#8217;&#8217; DuBois said with a laugh. &#8220;The optics of that would have been bad.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Bold idea</strong></p>
<p>Then came a flash of insight and a bold new plan. What if the Phillipses went ahead and released the wine anyhow, with the same label and the name, but with a brand-new twist?</p>
<p>Instead of trying to disassociate themselves from COVID-19, they would donate all the proceeds from "Going Viral'' to DuBois&#8217;s lab, which is developing a serological test to measure the levels of antibodies in people who have recovered from the coronavirus or in people who are taking experimental vaccines.</p>
<p>DuBois and her lab colleagues are using this test to evaluate the percentage of infections at UC Santa Cruz and in the community. She also hopes this test can be useful to evaluate the efficacy of vaccine candidates.</p>
<p>This campaign was a calculated risk, but the Phillips family has a hit on their hands. Customers have been rushing to buy "Going Viral."</p>
<p>The Phillips have made a commitment of $100,000 to DuBois&#8217;s lab, and have donated about $60,000. So far they&#8217;ve sold off roughly half of the 750 cases they produced of this new Merlot, which costs about $28 a bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Hometown support</strong></p>
<p>The Merlot grapes come from the Lodi vineyard where DuBois&#8217;s great grandmother grew up. The wine is aged in French oak, and has tasting notes that include &#8220;aromas of huckleberry and Bing cherry with a hint of cocoa and caramel on the nose,&#8221; along with &#8220;flavors of blackberry jam, dried cranberry and toasted baguette,&#8221; according to the winery website.</p>
<p>The Phillipses&#8217; decision to pivot and turn the wine into a fundraiser was a complete surprise to DuBois.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just amazing to have the support of my family and my hometown community," DuBois said. "To see everybody coming out to enjoy the wine in support of COVID-19 research is incredible.&#8221;</p>
<p>DuBois comes from generations of grape growers. Her sister and brother both work for the winery.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is definitely a family business,&#8221; said DuBois, who described herself as &#8220;a little bit of a black sheep in my family&#8212;with their full support.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>The partnership has drawn inquiries from newspapers as well as wine publications. All the attention was a bit overwhelming for the soft-spoken DuBois, who is accustomed to lots of quiet time in the lab, getting work done and social-distancing at the same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not used to all this press,&#8221; DuBois said.</p>
<p>Michael Phillips is grateful for the customer support and the chance to collaborate with his daughter, who grew up in Lodi.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;She loves research and is out to save the world,&#8221; Phillips told <em>Wine Business Monthly</em>. &#8220;That&#8217;s the big news in our family: us being proud of her and having her wine be successful and having people be enthusiastic about doing her work, a great thing to donate to as a winery.&#8221;&#160;</p>

<p>This &#8220;hot start&#8221; scenario, presented in a paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-020-0595-0">published June 22 in <em>Nature Geoscience</em></a>, contrasts with the traditional view of Pluto&#8217;s origins as a ball of frozen ice and rock in which radioactive decay could have eventually generated enough heat to melt the ice and form a subsurface ocean.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a long time people have thought about the thermal evolution of Pluto and the ability of an ocean to survive to the present day,&#8221; said coauthor Francis Nimmo, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Now that we have images of Pluto&#8217;s surface from NASA&#8217;s New Horizons mission, we can compare what we see with the predictions of different thermal evolution models.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because water expands when it freezes and contracts when it melts, the hot-start and cold-start scenarios have different implications for the tectonics and resulting surface features of Pluto, explained first author and UCSC graduate student Carver Bierson.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it started cold and the ice melted internally, Pluto would have contracted and we should see compression features on its surface, whereas if it started hot it should have expanded as the ocean froze and we should see extension features on the surface,&#8221; Bierson said. &#8220;We see lots of evidence of expansion, but we don&#8217;t see any evidence of compression, so the observations are more consistent with Pluto starting with a liquid ocean.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thermal and tectonic evolution of a cold-start Pluto is actually a bit complicated, because after an initial period of gradual melting the subsurface ocean would begin to refreeze. So compression of the surface would occur early on, followed by more recent extension. With a hot start, extension would occur throughout Pluto&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>&#8220;The oldest surface features on Pluto are harder to figure out, but it looks like there was both ancient and modern extension of the surface,&#8221; Nimmo said.</p>
<p>The next question was whether enough energy was available to give Pluto a hot start. The two main energy sources would be heat released by the decay of radioactive elements in the rock and gravitational energy released as new material bombarded the surface of the growing protoplanet.</p>
<p>Bierson&#8217;s calculations showed that if all of the gravitational energy was retained as heat, it would inevitably create an initial liquid ocean. In practice, however, much of that energy would radiate away from the surface, especially if the accretion of new material occurred slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;How Pluto was put together in the first place matters a lot for its thermal evolution,&#8221; Nimmo said. &#8220;If it builds up too slowly, the hot material at the surface radiates energy into space, but if it builds up fast enough the heat gets trapped inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers calculated that if Pluto formed over a period of less that 30,000 years, then it would have started out hot. If, instead, accretion took place over a few million years, a hot start would only be possible if large impactors buried their energy deep beneath the surface.</p>
<p>The new findings imply that other large Kuiper belt objects probably also started out hot and could have had early oceans. These oceans could persist to the present day in the largest objects, such as the dwarf planets Eris and Makemake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even in this cold environment so far from the sun, all these worlds might have formed fast and hot, with liquid oceans,&#8221; Bierson said.</p>
<p>In addition to Bierson and Nimmo, the paper was coauthored by Alan Stern at the Southwest Research Institute, the principal investigator of the New Horizons mission.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c9c6bf848072701763b3cba686e35656"><name>goingviral-rebeccadubois</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Raising a glass (and funds) for research</title><summary>The father and uncle of the virologist Rebecca DuBois, UC Santa Cruz Cruz associate professor of biomolecular engineering, are honoring and helping to fund her research through sales of their "Going Viral" wine.</summary><start-date>1592510460000</start-date><display-name>goingviralfeaturestory</display-name><path>/2020/06/goingviral-rebeccadubois</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/06/goingviral-rebeccadubois</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1592523145050</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1601419968735</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/06/goingviral400,jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/06/goingviral400,jpg</link><site>news</site><name>goingviral400,jpg</name><display-name>goingviral400,jpg</display-name><file-size>50948</file-size></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/06/goingviral80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/06/goingviral80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>goingviral80.jpg</name><display-name>goingviral80.jpg</display-name><file-size>16462</file-size><width>80</width><height>78</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The virologist Rebecca DuBois, UC Santa Cruz associate professor of biomolecular engineering, holding a bottle of "Going Viral" wine from Michael David Winery</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead> Michael David Winery helps fund professor’s COVID-19 research with 'Going Viral' Merlot</article-subhead><article-text><p>Michael Phillips had been looking for an eye-catching, thoughtful way to honor the groundbreaking and lifesaving work of his daughter, the virologist Rebecca DuBois, UC Santa Cruz associate professor of biomolecular engineering.</p>

The lockdown posed yet another obstacle for student teams that were already grappling with challenging projects.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Senior capstone projects are ambitious, student-led efforts to tackle an engineering problem or create a product or service. Intended to be the crowning achievement of an engineering education at UCSC, the projects may be sponsored by campus organizations or corporations, while others are entirely conceived and executed by students.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Capstone projects revolve around teamwork, which usually means long hours working together in the lab. During the pandemic, however, students were forced to find ways of collaborating on their projects without getting together in person. </span><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>The Coronanaut (Continental Automotive Indoor Robotics)</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p><span>One of the most ambitious projects in 2020 was the Indoor Robotics team sponsored by Continental. Their goal was to fuse Continental&#8217;s LiDAR, radar, and camera sensor information together into a single coherent &#8220;view&#8221; of a robot&#8217;s surroundings. In other words, they wanted to give a robot a new way of seeing the world and recognizing objects around it. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The team drew up plans to attach the complex sensors to a robot called a Husky UGV, an &#8220;unmanned ground vehicle&#8221; approximately the size of a wheelchair. Continental provided the robot and sensors. Team members Babak Farahmand, Daniel Luft-Martinez, Mayowa Borisade, Paige Riola, Shealtiel Mulder, and Walter Condori would have to mount the sensors to the robot and interpret the data they collected. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The shelter-in-place order kept students out of the labs, however, so they couldn&#8217;t access the robot or the tools they needed to measure its sensor data. Prospects for the team looked grim until Professor Emeritus Patrick Mantey, who directs the capstone program, proposed a solution. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Mantey suggested they enlist Veronica Hovanessian, a graduate student in electrical engineering, as a &#8220;coronanaut.&#8221; </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We could send her into the lab as if she were an astronaut on a spacewalk receiving instructions from the rest of the team over her headset,&#8221; Mantey said.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Hovanessian works with Baskin Engineering Lab Support (BELS), which meant she was one of the few people who had permission to be on campus during the lockdown. She said she was surprised to be summoned to a Zoom meeting with Mantey and Dean Alexander Wolf, who approved the plan.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Integrating the sensors was nerve-wracking work, and Hovanessian was careful to use a meter before connecting the expensive sensors. &#8220;Accidentally reversing polarity could cause a sensor&#8217;s functionality to stop, or even cause an explosion,&#8221; she said. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Once the sensors were attached to the robot and connected, Hovanessian began receiving transmissions from her distant teammates. They wanted her to tell them what the robot was &#8216;seeing&#8217; through its sensors.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Typically they would ask me something like &#8220;get us some data of what a chair looks like in front of the LiDAR sensor,&#8221; Hovanessian said. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The data she gathered was parsed by the rest of the team, who extrapolated conclusions and created models from what she gathered. Hovanessian said she was excited to be able to help the team succeed despite the pandemic. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Most of her teammates are graduating this quarter, which means there&#8217;s a good chance she might never meet them in person. &#8220;I hope when this is all over we can grab a beer or something to celebrate pulling this off,&#8221; she said.</span><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>The Potential Startup (Smart Seat for Posture Detection)</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p><span>The Smart Seat for Posture Detection team created what they call a &#8220;smart seat&#8221; to help people maintain good posture while sitting.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;It&#8217;s a chair attachment that sends an alert if you&#8217;re slouching,&#8221; explained team member Ali Fallahi. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>This required a great deal of engineering. There were proximity sensors and leaning sensors to wire, not to mention the challenge of creating an attractive, comfortable piece of furniture that someone would consider sitting on every working day. And then the coronavirus outbreak scrambled their plans.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Testing was the most challenging aspect for us,&#8221; Fallahi said. &#8220;We needed testbed setups, oscilloscopes, and network analyzers to test the electrical system. During an outbreak that becomes really difficult.&#8221;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Their solution was to recreate the UC Santa Cruz labs at home. The engineering school let them borrow a few vital pieces of equipment and provided credits so they could use <a href="https://its.ucsc.edu/news/matlab.html">MATLAB </a>from home. But the team realized they needed more than one team member running tests, so they bought additional tools to enable each member to work independently. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Costs tripled,&#8221; said team member Christopher Cheney. &#8220;Initially we drafted it up around $200, now we&#8217;re looking at more like five or six hundred.&#8221;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Progress was slow without access to the lab, and the assembly became a much more deliberate, meticulous process. The students focused on perfecting their algorithms. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Software-wise, our end result will probably be better than we originally planned,&#8221; said team member Zachary Haughton. &#8220;Our prototype won&#8217;t be as super nice and presentable as we wanted it to be, but at its core it will work really nicely.&#8221; </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Communication was a major challenge for the group. &#8220;When you don&#8217;t have in-person contact, problem solving together takes much longer,&#8221; Haughton said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t just start drawing stuff on the whiteboard. But it certainly wasn&#8217;t an insurmountable challenge.&#8221;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The team thanked Professors Stephen Peterson and Tela Favaloro for their help with the project. The students hope their research into posture correction could be the start of a business or a partnership with an existing company. For the most part, they managed to hit their goals.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;When we look back at all of this, I think we&#8217;ll all be incredibly proud of what we managed to achieve,&#8221; Fallahi said.</span><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>The Homeless Charging Station </span></strong><span></span></p>
<p><span>One team wanted their project to address the problems of homeless people in Santa Cruz. &#8220;There are about 2,200 homeless in the county, and we wanted to alleviate some of the stress they feel,&#8221; said team member Jordan Tam. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The team began by surveying homeless adults. One of the problems they discovered was that the homeless had very few places to charge their phones. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Many of them would go into libraries or businesses to look for outlets,&#8221; Tam said. &#8220;Even in these areas outlets were few and far between.&#8221;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Homeless people use cellphones to trade information about resources, and having a fully-charged phone can mean the difference between a hot meal and going to bed hungry. The team partnered with the Homeless Gardens Project, a respected local organization that helps the homeless reintegrate into the community, giving them a job in the gardens and helping them find housing. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We realized that the Homeless Garden was completely off-grid,&#8221; Tam said. &#8220;We decided it would be an excellent area to provide power to, so our original plan was to build them a solar-powered charging station.&#8221;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The original design included a solar-powered station with six locking compartments so individuals could safely leave their phones to charge while they worked. It was designed to be both theft- and weather-resistant and was to be made of stainless steel and a robust polycarbonate plastic.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Things were looking up. Sandbar Solar donated a large solar panel to the project. The team completed their designs and set aside the final quarter for fabrication, assembly, and integration. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Then the coronavirus struck. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Sandbar Solar wasn&#8217;t considered an essential service,&#8221; Tam said, &#8220;so they weren&#8217;t open, and neither were the plastic and metal shops.&#8221;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Fabrication ground to a halt. Then most of the team had to go home. Tam was based out of Danville, and two others remained in Santa Cruz, but one went home to India, which meant the team also to adapt to the time difference.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Other problems arose. Since they couldn&#8217;t outsource fabrication, they focused on the designs, preparing the project for the next senior capstone team to take on. They simulated as much as possible, but simulation can only do so much. They weren&#8217;t able to test the weatherproofing and theft-resistance, nor were they able to properly debug circuit boards. (The ideal conditions of a simulation rarely measure up to the real world when it comes to circuit boards.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Despite the difficulties, the team was able to create a functional prototype. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We created a prototype out of medium-density fiberboard, which is a pretty flimsy material, but the Homeless Garden Project asked for anything we could give them,&#8221; Tam said.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The Homeless Garden Project plans to place the charger in a weatherproof shed. The team also added a smaller solar panel and a battery, which would allow the machine to work during cloudy days.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Tam said it was hard having to scale back their plans. &#8220;We were really sad because we wanted to see a finished end product and to create something that would really help the Homeless Garden project,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;re giving them something, but it&#8217;s a huge step down from what we&#8217;d envisioned.&#8221;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>All three groups said they thought rising to the challenge of working together during the COVID-19 pandemic was an experience that would eventually help them become better engineers. It was a sentiment shared by most of the Senior Design Project teams this year. </span><span></span></p>

With the establishment of this endowment, the Hellman Fellows Program will have committed a total of $125 million to support research for outstanding early-career faculty at all 10 UC campuses. The endowment will provide protected streams of funding in perpetuity through the creation of the Society of Hellman Fellows.</p>
<p>The gift will fund endowments at each campus, with the universities each administering the program. Fellowships are open to a broad range of academic disciplines across all fields, including the arts, humanities, social sciences, and STEM. Fellowships range from $10,000 to $50,000, and many former fellows have gone on to become award-winning researchers, MacArthur &#8220;Genius Grant&#8221; recipients, and department chairs.</p>
<p>"The Hellman Fellows Program has been transformational for scholars at UC Santa Cruz, because it provides support at a critical time on the way to tenure, allowing faculty to do seed projects to win larger grants or to travel to archives or field sites to complete research for major projects," said Herbie Lee, vice provost for academic affairs, noting that nearly 75 fellows have received support since 2011. "The Hellman family has had a lasting impact on this campus, and this endowment carries that legacy forward. It's a tremendous gift."</p>
<p>By creating endowments at each UC location, the Hellman Fellows Program gives flexibility to each campus in how the awards are directed and managed, building on the program&#8217;s tradition of local control while honoring the intent of the founders. UCSC, like many campuses, will seek additional or matching gifts that will allow the campus to expand the program and reach more early-career faculty members over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;My parents, Warren and Chris Hellman, used to say that creating the Hellman Fellows Program was one of the best things our family ever did,&#8221; said Frances Hellman, president of the Hellman Fellows Fund. &#8220;Having had the opportunity to support over 1,900 faculty over the years, I enthusiastically agree. Their discoveries, commitment to their work, and great potential continues to inspire us year after year. We are thrilled to be carrying on our father&#8217;s legacy by ensuring that the Hellman Fellows Program can exist in perpetuity throughout the University of California system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since its founding in 1995, the Hellman Fellows Program has provided $125 million to fund research fellowships to early-career faculty across the UC system. With this generous new gift, the program will be able to continue in perpetuity across all campuses of the world-renowned public research institution.</p>
<p>&#8220;With dwindling federal funding and a critical need for UC research, especially during the coronavirus era, this generous gift could not come at a better time,&#8221; said UC President Janet Napolitano. &#8220;The incredible public spirit of the Hellman Fellows Program will support yet another generation of outstanding scholars and scientists whose careers, achievements, and breakthrough research will benefit California and the world. We will be forever grateful to the Hellman family for this enduring, impactful program.&#8221;</p>
<p>Federal funding for academic research has been flat or declining for the past decade, and for the fourth straight year the Trump administration has proposed deep cuts to science research. Funding for academic research is especially critical now to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related economic and social concerns.</p>
<p>In addition to their impactful research in a wide range of fields, it is noteworthy that at least 125 former Hellman fellows are currently involved in groundbreaking COVID-19 related research. Former award recipients include engineers working to convert sleep apnea machines into ventilators, epidemiologists studying the origins and spread of the disease, statisticians designing optimal surveillance approaches to help curtail the spread of the virus, and scientists examining societal changes in violence due to the progression of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The Hellman Fellows Fund was established by the Hellman family in 1995 to fund the research of promising assistant professors who showed capacity for great distinction in their chosen fields but needed support to begin to reach those goals. The impetus for the program came when Frances Hellman, a junior faculty member at UC San Diego, experienced first-hand the challenges that faculty can experience early in their careers before their research can attract external support.</p>
<p>The program made its first awards to a handful of faculty at UC San Diego and UC Berkeley. The program grew organically over the years to include all 10 UC campuses and four private institutions.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, past recipients of Hellman fellowships include Mark Massoud, an expert in the rule of law, former Guggenheim and Carnegie Fellow, and the 2022 Evans-Pritchard lecturer at Oxford University.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Hellman Fellowship launched the research I conducted for a number of articles and a book," said Massoud, associate professor of politics and director of the Legal Studies program. "It provided me with space and, most importantly, with confidence that my project was feasible. I am grateful to the Hellmans for endowing this program on all 10 University of California campuses. It is great to know that their support of early career scholars will continue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additional former fellows include coastal ecologist Eric Palkovacs; social and cultural psychologist Rebecca Covarrubias; and Sylvanna Falc&#243;n, a professor of Latin American Studies, director of the Research Center for the Americas, and founder of the UCSC Human Rights Lab.</p>
<p>Palkovacs, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and associate director of the Fisheries Collaborative Program, said his 2015 fellowship came at a critical point in his career.</p>
<p>"It allowed me to maximize the value of my start-up funding and transition a major aspect of my research program to NSF funding, which in turn was a critical step towards earning tenure," he said. "Since receiving the award, I have served on the selection committee at UC Santa Cruz as a way to give back to the program that supported me during this critical time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Covarrubias, associate professor of psychology and faculty director of the Student Success Equity Research Center, expressed gratitude for the support she received in 2017, which funded a community-based longitudinal research project aimed at understanding the college-transition experiences of low-income, Latinx first-generation-to-college high school students.</p>
<p>"We offered important stipends for high school students to engage in the research and supported a team of undergraduate students to visit the local high schools," she said. "This project also gave us a strong foundation to secure more grant monies to fund other elements of the project.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e26b8d3a8072701763b3cba63309c785"><name>soule-obituary</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Michael Soulé, father of conservation biology, dies at 84</title><summary>Michael Soulé, a professor emeritus of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz who was widely considered the "father of conservation biology," died on June 17.

"He had an amazing vision that environmental studies wasn't just conservation biology, but it had a social dimension, too. He realized the human dimension was the most problematic part of conservation. Conservation is not just about studying nature. It's about studying nature and people together."

He was 84.</p>
<p>Soul&#233;, who had been hospitalized since suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage on June 8, championed a vision of conservation biology that integrates human challenges with science in the quest to protect the natural world. In 1986, he cofounded and was the first president of the <a href="https://conbio.org/">Society for Conservation Biology</a>, and in 1991 cofounded the <a href="https://wildlandsnetwork.org/">Wildlands Network</a>, two organizations that helped bring his vision to the forefront of environmental studies.</p>
<p>"He was a giant," said longtime friend and former colleague Jim Estes, professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC. "He had an amazing vision that environmental studies wasn't just conservation biology, but it had a social dimension, too. He realized the human dimension was the most problematic part of conservation. Conservation is not just about studying nature. It's about studying nature and people together."</p>
<p>Trained as a biologist, Soul&#233;'s research revolved around population viability, conservation genetics, and what he called "ecological effectiveness,"' which takes into consideration species interactions and the influence of predators through food webs. He conducted pioneering research in various areas, including population and evolutionary biology, population genetics, island biogeography, environmental studies, biodiversity policy, and ethics. His later work focused on the genetic basis of fitness and viability in natural populations, on the impacts of "keystone" species, and on the social causes of the destruction of nature worldwide.</p>
<p>At UCSC, Soul&#233; was hired in 1989 as professor and chair of the Environmental Studies Department, where he brought to life his vision of an interdisciplinary program that is home to both natural and social scientists. Under Soul&#233;'s leadership, UCSC launched a doctoral program in environmental studies in 1994, the first in the UC system and one of the first of its kind in the nation.</p>
<p>"He had this amazing vision, and he muscled the powers that be to give him all kinds of resources," recalled Estes. "He created a very vibrant department."</p>
<p>Daniel Press, professor of environmental studies and one of the faculty members hired during Soul&#233;'s tenure as chair, praised Soul&#233;'s approach to environmental studies. "He got pushback from some scientists, who said we can't have mission-driven science," said Press. "They thought the science would be tainted by values- and morals-driven commitments. But others of us cheered, saying you absolutely can do rigorous science with different, explicit reasons for doing it."</p>
<p>Soul&#233; retired from UCSC in 1994 and relocated to Colorado, where he continued to be active for two decades. Soul&#233; dedicated himself to the Wildlands Network, a global organization committed to restoring wild areas, especially in North America. Soul&#233; and his partners envisioned the conservation of habitat and migration corridors&#8212;at a continental scale&#8212;for wildlife.</p>
<p>"Michael imagined an America, especially the American West, where it would be possible for a wolf or a mountain lion or a large ungulate to walk from the Continental Divide to the sea without encountering an insurmountable obstacle," said Press. "He felt it had to be done, it could be done, and it should be done."</p>
<p>Extinction and the loss of wild nature weighed heavily on Soul&#233;. "He was famous for saying that 'Death is one thing, but an end to births is another,'" recalled Press.</p>
<p>In a note to colleagues announcing Soul&#233;'s death, Estes wrote: "Although his first love was living nature, he thought deeply about ethics and humanity."</p>
<p>Widely recognized for his contributions, Soul&#233; was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Archie Carr Medal, and the E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Technology Pioneer Award.</p>
<p>Soul&#233; was the author and editor of many books on biology and conservation biology, including <em>Conservation Biology: An Evolutionary-Ecological Perspective </em>with B. A. Wilcox; <em>Conservation and Evolution </em>with O. H. Frankel; <em>Conservation Biology: The Science of Scarcity and Diversity</em>; <em>Viable Populations for Conservation</em>; <em>Research Priorities for Conservation Biology </em>with K. A. Kohm; <em>Reinventing Nature? Responses to Postmodern Deconstruction </em>with Gary Lease; and <em>Continental Conservation: Scientific Foundations of Regional Reserve Networks </em>with John Terborgh.</p>
<p>At UCSC, Soul&#233; advised several graduate students in ecology and environmental biology who became prominent scholars and advocates, including television personality M. Sanjayan, CEO of the nonprofit Conservation International; Kevin Crooks, a professor at Colorado State University; and L. Scott Mills, professor of wildlife biology and associate vice president of research for global change and sustainability at the University of Montana.</p>
<p>Soul&#233; grew up in San Diego, earned his undergraduate degree from San Diego State College, and obtained his Ph.D from Stanford University, where he was the first graduate student of eminent American biologist Paul Ehrlich. He resigned from a faculty position at UC San Diego in distress over the rampant development of Southern California. After spending some time at the Zen Center of Los Angeles, where he was director of the Kuroda Institute for the Study of Buddhism, which publishes scholarly books through the University of Hawaii Press, Soul&#233; returned to academia, taking a position in the Department of Natural Resources at the University of Michigan before being hired at UCSC.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The messages came from a sender identifying itself as Equity Prime Mortgage. It contained racial slurs and threats of violence against Black people.

Not only did we have the largest pool of nominees in recent history, but we had more than 450 people cast votes, more than doubling last year's election participation. We greatly appreciate the engagement and look forward to building on it going forward. <br/><br/>This year we had four openings to fill, and the four highest vote tallies were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travis S. Becker; Director, Lionel Cant&#250; Queer Resource Center</li>
<li>Danny Rodriguez; Lead Academic Preceptor, Oakes College</li>
<li>Liz Moya; Renaissance Scholars Program Counselor</li>
<li>Nathan McCall; HR Business Information Services Manager</li>
</ul>
Travis, Danny, and Liz will be new to the board, and we are excited for them to join us. Nathan will be serving a second term, and we are grateful for his continued service. <br/><br/>All candidates have our appreciation. Their leadership and service on campus is valuable, and we hope to work with all of them moving forward.<br/><br/>The 2019-2020 board members will vote on leadership positions next week, and then we will formally roll over to the 2020-21 Board on July 1. Leadership positions will be posted when available. <br/><br/>A brief update on questions from our June 5 forum: All questions were recorded and were submitted to the campus leadership team on Tuesday. Apologies for the delay, but we look forward to getting answers back in the next few weeks. They will be posted on our website when available. <br/><br/>Congrats again to our newest members, and thanks to everyone for their engagement!<br/><br/>The Staff Advisory Board</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC staff</audience><admin>UCSC Staff Advisory Board</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f18d43948072701763b3cba60a6a0e33"><name>julie-retires</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Seymour Center director to retire</title><summary>During Julie Barrett Heffington’s 21-year term as director, the center has established widely appreciated public programs and served nearly 1.5 million visitors</summary><keywords>seymour, ocean, science</keywords><start-date>1593208800000</start-date><display-name>julie-retires</display-name><path>/2020/06/julie-retires</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/06/julie-retires</link><created-by>jhillard</created-by><created-on>1593190466423</created-on><last-modified-by>jhillard</last-modified-by><last-modified>1593209757358</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value><value>Feature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Staff Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>J.D.

With lengthy expertise in environmental education, Heffington hired the staff and oversaw development of exhibits and programs as construction completed on a purpose-built building on the bluffs of Terrace Point with a system to supply fresh seawater to its aquariums. <br/><br/>Gary Griggs was director of the Institute for Marine Sciences at the time and led her hiring. He credits her for bringing about the center&#8217;s most recognized and appreciated public programs.<br/><br/>&#8220;Julie was the perfect person to serve as the center&#8217;s founding director,&#8221; says Griggs, who is now distinguished professor of Earth sciences. &#8220;She really created the center: the education program, outreach, summer ocean explorers. Julie should get a large share of the credit for what the center is today.&#8221;<br/>
<h3>Sharing UCSC&#8217;s research with the community</h3>
The center has had nearly a million and a half visitors while she has been director, a statistic that Griggs says makes the center UCSC&#8217;s most active point of contact with the community as well as out-of-town visitors.<br/><br/>&#8220;If you come to the university to visit, you can drive through the campus but you can&#8217;t go in and see what&#8217;s going on in the chemistry or biology building,&#8221; Griggs says. &#8220;The Seymour Center has become a wonderful year-round community resource as well as a university resource. <br/><br/>&#8220;In 26 years as director of the Institute for Marine Sciences, the Seymour Center is what I&#8217;m most proud of,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t have had a better partner to do that with than Julie. &#8221;<br/><br/>Griggs also commends Heffington for leading a fundraising operation that has supported the majority of the center&#8217;s budget for over 20 years. <br/><br/>&#8220;There are very few people on campus who know they have to fundraise their salary every day," Griggs said. "That is a big burden to carry, and Julie did this with grace, passion, and dedication.&#8221;<br/>
<h3>Her natural habitat</h3>
Heffington grew up amid the oilfields and farmlands outside of Bakersfield. The experience that led to a lifetime of work with nature was a summer camp in the Sierras.<br/><br/>&#8220;I was the happiest kid in the world,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Some kids say they want to be an astronaut. I wanted to grow up and be an elk.&#8221;<br/><br/>In 1978, her experience with farmwork led to a job with the state of California as one of the first women in the state hired as a heavy equipment operator &#8212; driving snow plows. The solitary work did not suit her highly social personality, and it was difficult to be the &#8220;token 20-something female,&#8221; she says.<br/><br/>Three years after she took the job, she enrolled at CSU Humboldt. <br/>
<h3>Environmental educator</h3>
While pursuing her master's, she worked for the National Park Service&#8212;she met her husband when they were both rangers at Redwood National Park. She went on to work with the U.S. Forest Service in the Cascade Mountains and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife at Elkhorn Slough, among other roles in wilderness areas in California and Alaska. Making science and natural history accessible to the public has been a constant theme of her career. <br/><br/>In the early 1990s, she became director of education and gardens for the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center at the University of Texas at Austin. The former first lady was her supervisor&#8217;s supervisor and worked just upstairs. Similar to her later role at the Seymour, Heffington established and then oversaw public outreach and educational programs as the center moved into its permanent home.<br/><br/>Seven years later, friends in the Santa Cruz area alerted Heffington that the Seymour Marine Discovery Center was making its own transition to a permanent home and needed a director who could build up its educational programs. <br/><br/>&#8220;I loved the idea that the institution would be smack in the middle of the science that was happening," Heffington said. "Often nature education is third hand.&#8221;<br/><br/>Under her direction the center&#8217;s well-established volunteer operation grew to more than 200 volunteers.<br/>
<h3>A rare opportunity to share science</h3>
Roxanne Beltran, an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, says Heffington helped her figure out what she was doing in marine science education. Beltran had her first paid education position as a Seymour Center student assistant, a work-study role, in 2010. <br/><br/>&#8220;Julie was always there, a constant source of support and inspiration,&#8221; Beltran says. &#8220;Her office door was always open for any questions or any help that I ever needed.&#8221;<br/><br/>It&#8217;s uncommon, Beltran says, for an aquarium to tie its exhibits so closely to ongoing research. <br/><br/>&#8220;A lot of the science that we do is outside in remote places where there's no internet connection,&#8221; Beltran says. &#8220;The fact that the Seymour Center is able to interpret that research to so many people in such compelling ways has always been a real plus for us as scientists and a real special opportunity.&#8221;<br/><br/>John Laird, former California secretary of natural resources, who is also an honorary Seymour Center board member, says the center was lucky to find Heffington. <br/><br/>&#8220;It was incredible that she had the background that she had before coming to the Seymour,&#8221; Laird says. &#8220;She brought this knowledge and ability to communicate when she walked in the door, and she took Seymour to the next level, made it what it is.&#8221;<br/><br/>Heffington was especially successful at building support in the community, Laird says. Regular events like Science Sundays and the annual Global Oceans Gala earned the center recognition, and Heffington&#8217;s combination of friendliness and knowledge made her a persuasive ambassador.<br/><br/>&#8220;There's a whole generation of community leaders in our region who have not had the ability to say no to Julie,&#8221; he says.<br/>
<h3>The next 20 years</h3>
With visitor operations halted by the pandemic, much of the staff have been laid off. Science Sundays and the Ocean Explorers summer camps continue, although in virtual form. Meanwhile, the center is working with national museum experts to review its programming. <br/><br/>Heffington hopes the center continues growing. The beloved programs established during her tenure built on work that began in the 1970s, she says.<br/><br/>&#8220;Imagine what the next 20 years could look like,&#8221; she says.<br/><br/>Heffington plans to spend retirement on the adventures she didn&#8217;t have time for&#8212;or didn&#8217;t get enough of&#8212;during her career.

Shakespeare to present their first virtual Shakespeare Summer Series.</span></p>
<p><span>Titled <em>Und</em><em>iscov</em><em>ered Shakespea</em><em>re: The Wars of the Roses</em><strong>, </strong>this will be a free public arts and humanities series, bringing professional actors and scholars together with the community for a staged reading and discussion of the works that made Shakespeare famous in the London theater.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Running from July 1 to September 2, it will feature 10 sessions exploring rarely performed plays, looking at them from the perspective of Shakespeare&#8217;s career, and as a mirror for the current times we now live in.</span></p>
<p><span>Professor of literature Sean Keilen, director of UCSC&#8217;s Shakespeare Workshop, noted that due to the pandemic, they decided to turn <i>Weekend with Shakespeare</i>&#8212;a summertime partnership with Santa Cruz Shakespeare which usually takes place over two days during a normal summer&#8212;into the new free series.</span></p>
<p><span>"Although there will be no productions at Santa Cruz Shakespeare this summer, I have teamed up with the good people there to create a 10-week virtual encounter with Shakespeare's first tetralogy:&#160;<i>Henry VI</i>, Parts 1, 2, and 3&#160;and&#160;<i>Richard III</i>,&#8221; said Keilen. &#8220;What better time to explore the plays that you will probably never see on stage than a summer when...you can't see any plays on stage.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;These were the plays that gave Shakespeare his start in the theater,&#8221; added Keilen. &#8220;<i>Henry VI, Part 3</i>&#160;may have made him famous in his own time&#8212;lines from the play were memorable enough to appear in a pamphlet attacking Shakespeare, an actor, for trespassing on the professional turf of university-educated playwrights.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Keilen pointed out that although that play is about a late-medieval civil war in England, these plays by Shakespeare also share concerns that we have now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;They assert the potency of women as agents at moments of historical crisis,&#8221; said Keilen. &#8220;They consider the relationship between politics and religion as competing loadstars for collective identity. They suggest that the rhetoric one nation uses to demonize another nation will eventually turn inward and divide that nation against itself. They give a voice to the suffering of the poor and oppressed against ruling elites.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;And finally, they lay the foundation for what Coleridge called Shakespeare's myriad-mindedness, as the young writer learns how to develop character in ways that simultaneously call for sympathy and refrain from judgment,&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p><span><i>Undiscovered Shakespeare</i> will meet once a week for approximately 90 minutes to two hours, beginning at 6:30 p.m. Each meeting starts with a dramatic reading of a section of the play at hand by professional actors. After a brief intermission, there will be a discussion, coordinated by a visiting scholar and supported by a dramaturg at SCS. The final meeting of the series will take the form of a complete reading&#160;of&#160;<i>Richard III</i>.</span></p>
<p><span>The series kicks off on Wednesday, July 1, with the first session including guest scholars Adam Zucker, professor of English at the University of Massachusettes, Ameherst; and UCLA lecturer<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span><span>Ariane Helou, who previously taught at UC Santa Cruz, where she also earned her Ph.D.</span></p>
<p><span>Keilen noted that at last count, over 400 people had already signed up for the program.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><i>Shakespeare Workshop</i></strong></span><span> is a joint effort by faculty and students in the Literature and Theater Arts Departments at UC Santa Cruz to explore questions, topics, and areas of shared concern with both the campus community and the community off campus--using Shakespeare&#8217;s works as a common vocabulary.</span></p>
<p><span>Its recent programs have focused on a translation of Shakespeare&#8217;s sonnets into American Sign Language, prison-based productions of Shakespeare&#8217;s plays, and Shakespeare&#8217;s interest in the experience of veterans and the challenges they face when coming home from war.</span></p>

interdisciplinary projects have received seed funding from the UC Santa Cruz Foundation following a campuswide call for proposals issued by the Office of Research.</p>
<p>Each project will receive $12,000 during the 2020&#8211;21 academic year as part of an experimental, one-year pilot project designed to build relationships between faculty and trustee &#8220;sponsors&#8221; of each project. The larger goal is strengthening the faculty role in campus fundraising, and putting faculty-initiated research projects at the center of campus philanthropy, said Susan Gillman, professor of literature and chair of the Academic Senate Committee on Development and Fundraising (CDF).</p>
<p>After applying for a $36,000 Foundation Board Opportunity Fund (BOF) grant, the CDF reviewed 17 proposals, identified three, and presented them the BOF committee at its meeting last month. On June 6, the foundation approved the grant proposal.</p>
<p>The three projects are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Center for Monster Studies:</strong> Michael Chemers, professor of dramatic literature, says a Center for Monster Studies will provide a vehicle for the interdisciplinary study of how societies define and decide how to frame and punish difference and deviance. In their application for funding, Chemers and co-principal investigators Elizabeth Swensen, assistant professor of art and design in Games and Playable Media, and Noah Wardrip-Fruin, professor of computational media, wrote: &#8220;The benefits of taking monsters seriously have been long acknowledged by anthropologists and psychologists, but we locate our critique firmly within cultural studies insofar as its central emphasis is an inquiry into cultural practices, seeking to unlock the mechanics of identity construction.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Community-Engaged Scholarship at UCSC:</strong> The seed funding for this project, which is led by Rebecca London, assistant professor of sociology, will be used to help establish a Campus + Community Center on campus. The center will serve as a central hub of resources for scholars and organizations that participate in community-engaged scholarship. Based in the Institute for Social Transformation, the center will identify best practices for community-engaged scholarship, including establishing a set of values and support systems for faculty and community partners that will foster productive collaborations. Seed funds will specifically support the hiring this summer of graduate and undergraduate students to help write grants. The larger aim, London says, is to further &#8220;embed community-engaged research into the UCSC fabric.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Building a Culture for Health:</strong> Politics Professor Matt Sparke is leading an interdisciplinary team that will investigate health inequalities with a focus on the health of underserved LatinX migrant communities. The team&#8217;s goal is two-fold: to research the health needs of vulnerable migrant and homeless populations, and to develop a pipeline for health-worker training from high schools through community colleges and UCSC. Sparke says &#8220;This larger vision of a health worker education pipeline will build on community connections that UCSC researchers have already been fostering in our local Santa Cruz and Pajaro Valley communities,&#8221; said Sparke. Seed funding will cover the cost of workshops that will bring together community-based organizations and community health workers, fostering relationships and collaboration that will lay the foundation for subsequent applications for significant funding.</li>

<p>Gillman, called the seed funding effort &#8220;the start of a new direct faculty-Foundation partnership.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a four-way collaboration among the Senate Committee on Development and Fundraising, University Relations, the Office of Research, and the UCSC Foundation and trustees via the Board Opportunity Fund,&#8221; said Gillman. &#8220;Unprecedented is an overused word these days, but it describes our experiment perfectly.&#8221;</p>
<p>In close collaboration with the Office of Research, the CDF reviewed the 17 proposals from the Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences. &#8220;From that group, CDF picked the three proposals that we judged excellent by our metrics and that we believe speak to the values of the Board Opportunity Fund,&#8221; said Gillman. Each is interdisciplinary and includes student participation, typically graduate students who will be involved in research and grant-writing, she said.</p>
<p>Together the CDF and BOF are in the process of pairing trustee sponsors with each of the three projects. &#8220;Individual trustee involvement is important to create a longer-term relationship and greater dividends for both applicants and trustees,&#8221; said Gillman. &#8220;This will lay fertile ground for a potential continuing relationship between the faculty and the board, one of the main aims in launching this new partnership.&#8221;</p>
<p>The seed funding will be released by June 26.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="078d0d8b8072701763b3cba64539c321"><name>merrill-college-profile-story</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Merrill College: Embracing individuality and cultural identities</title><summary>Merrill College values diversity, inclusion, and experiential learning.&#13;

It&#8217;s no wonder that Merrill affiliates describe their college with loyalty and affection.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everywhere you look at this centrally located and robust college community, you will find examples of diverse academic programs and hands-on learning opportunities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I loved Merrill College from the first moment I stepped foot on it, on move-in day of my freshman year,&#8221; said student and Merrill Student Government Chair Alexa Manning (Merrill &#8216;22, ecology and evolutionary biology). &#8220;I immediately felt welcome and part of a family ever since.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merrill is an inviting and well-shaded place, occupying a redwood grove shared by </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/08/crown-college-profile-story.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crown College</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on one of campus's largest hills. Students who are seeking a strenuous workout can access the place by hiking the path known as Cardiac Hill&#8212;a walkway that deserves its comical (but slightly scary) nickname.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merrill was founded in 1968 when the family trust of Charles J. Merrill Jr. provided a $650,000 gift to UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merrill Jr.&#8217;s philanthropic visions aligned with the plans of Merrill&#8217;s founding faculty, who envisioned a community that valued interdisciplinary education, social issues, and human rights.</span></p>
<p><strong>Merrill&#8217;s overarching ethos</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merrill&#8217;s course curriculum builds on the theme, &#8220;Exploring Cultural Identities &amp; Raising Global Consciousness.&#8221; By taking a multidisciplinary approach, Merrill courses allow students to analyze different societies and cultures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Merrill affiliates examine the world through a dual lens, one being a lens of understanding our own identities and the other taking an open-minded approach of the world around us,&#8221; said Merrill College Provost Elizabeth Abrams, a senior teaching professor in Merrill&#8217;s writing program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That dual-lens approach gives students a strong ethical commitment, while helping them to understand how changes in the developing world unfold in relation to the developed world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The core class at Merrill, known as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">College 1,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is designed to fine-tune students&#8217; analytical and critical skills, along with their powers of &#8220;metacognition,&#8221; an awareness of one&#8217;s own thought processes. Students sharpen those skills by having intensive discussions on topics ranging from self identity to social justice.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Abrams noted, students adopt the mindset of being a &#8220;learner&#8221; instead of a &#8220;knower&#8221; when they step into the core course class. Here, you will find the opposite of rote-learning methods that sometimes give education a bad name. The overarching goal is teaching young scholars </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to think, not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">wha</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">t to think.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Merrillites&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merrill College students, sometimes nicknamed Merrillites, are a diverse group.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merrill students major in a variety of disciplines, but the two most common major divisions are science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and social science&#8212;with a sizable social science population majoring in one of the three departments housed on the Merrill campus: politics, legal studies, and Latin American and Latino studies (LALS).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus is remote enough to maintain its own identity, yet centrally located enough so students don&#8217;t have to wear themselves out heading to Science Hill, or Quarry Plaza, or other hotspots on campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stroll around Merrill, and you will see outdoor study groups, picnics, and socializing at every turn.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Merrill Plaza is always full of students whether they are sunbathing on the lawn or having group study sessions at the tables in front of Vivas restaurant,&#8221; said student Manning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The college has a slightly futuristic look, with its impressive, criss-crossing bridges and its sweeping views of forests. It also has a vibrant, interactive, and ever-growing public-art project that sets it apart from any other landmark on campus. The Merrill Moat is a mural like no other, with roots going back to the beginnings of UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moat is an eye-catching pictorial representation of Merrill students, their influences, and values. Walking slowly along this mural, you will get a grand tour of nature imagery, abstract art, and affectionate portraits of civil rights leaders, with inspirational quotes to frame your experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This inviting and expansive mural roams across one of the pathway walls located steps away from the Merrill College dorm buildings. This is public art at its best, open and accessible to everyone.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Advancing Merrill&#8217;s core values</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merrill College hosts one of campus&#8217;s most exciting projects, the Research Center for the Americas (RCA), which invites students, staff, and faculty to take part in research, events, and dialogue around Latin American cultural experiences. Topics of discussion and research include human rights, education, labor, immigration, and politics.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The center provides a valuable platform to the campus community to participate in collective inquiry and social activism efforts to advance equal rights for the Latin American population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fall of 2016, Merrill College established a trans-inclusive housing program intended for transgender, genderqueer, gender nonconforming, gender nonbinary, questioning, and ally first-year students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students who apply for this housing program are placed into a positive and affirming living environment for people of all gender identities. The goal is to create a place where students can feel further supported by peers and affiliated staff.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merrill also boasts a one-of-a-kind artmaking center, Merrill Pottery Co-Op, a student-run ceramics program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a facility that makes tactile learning and tactile experience available to a wide range of people, particularly students who want to contribute to the arts in a nonacademic setting and are generally non-art majors,&#8221; Abrams said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Co-Op prioritizes Merrill students for membership, students from other colleges are also welcome to apply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These programs, spearheaded by Merrill College, build on the college&#8217;s core values of creating a space where all individuals, regardless of race, identity, or culture, can feel welcome.</span></p>
<p><strong>Embracing community involvement&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Merrill, students gain the tools they need to engage with the campus and Santa Cruz communities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merrill Student Government (MSG) handles the funding of Merrill&#8217;s academic and residential programs, student-run organizations, and college-wide initiatives. MSG aids in the community culture seen at Merrill and helps keep traditions alive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Being a part of Merrill Student Government means being a voice for Merrill affiliates both in-house and out in the wider UCSC community,&#8221; said Manning.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With experiential education learning programs like the Field Study program, Merrillites can make a positive impact. Students get to choose a nonprofit organization in Santa Cruz County to intern with for the quarter. They then spend their time in the program gaining invaluable skills and applying classroom knowledge to solve social issues experienced or foreseen at the organization.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large portion of Merrill alumni go on to make positive changes in their communities through public service careers, carrying out the long-standing Merrill values of creating acceptance and inclusion in the community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even those who did not designate Merrill College as their first college choice often end up falling in love with the place.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is a trend among Merrill students and that is that they end up developing a deep sense of pride for this college,&#8221; said Julie Phillips, associate director, college student life.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="078f68868072701763b3cba6f04bde2e"><name>campus-budget-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus budget update</title><summary>As we near the end of the fiscal year, I want to update you on what we know at this time about the University of California system and the UC Santa Cruz campus budget outlooks and what that means for our faculty and staff.</summary><start-date>1593500400000</start-date><display-name>Campus budget update</display-name><path>/2020/06/campus-budget-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/06/campus-budget-update</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1593559705708</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594748739905</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span color="#333333" style="color: #333333;">As we near the end of the fiscal year, I want to update you on what we know at this time about the University of California system and the UC Santa Cruz campus budget outlooks and what that means for our faculty and staff. I know how challenging these past few months have been and how the unknowns surrounding our fiscal future have added to the worries of many. I am so grateful for the dedication to our campus mission and to our students that you all have shown through this time. While I do not yet have answers for every question you might have regarding the upcoming fiscal year, I hope this update can provide some clarity on where things stand.<br/><br/><span size="4" style="font-size: large;">What we know currently about the UC budget</span><br/><br/>The governor and the state Legislature have reached agreement on a state budget. As written, effective July 1, the UC base budget would be cut by $300.8 million (8.1%) from current levels. We do not know yet how the cut will be applied across the campuses. Whether the cut will be permanent depends on whether the state receives $14 billion in new federal stimulus funds by Oct. 15. If the federal funding comes through, UC would receive up to $471.6 million to offset cuts. If realized, that federal funding could reverse the July 1 cuts and result in a net increase of $170.8 million (4.6%) compared to UC&#8217;s overall 2019-20 state budget allocation.<br/><br/>Of course, state funding is only one aspect of our fiscal picture. We won&#8217;t have clarity on our tuition revenue until we are about a month into the fall quarter. Currently, our enrollment figures look strong, but it is unclear how adjustments to our instructional delivery and operations in fall will impact the decisions of our students and their families.<br/><br/>Our sales and service operations (auxiliaries) have already seen large revenue reductions due to changes in operations and service resulting from COVID-19. Housing and dining operations for spring and summer saw a reduction in revenue of $49 million. Many other operations including TAPS and the Student Health Center have also experienced large revenue reductions. With COVID-19-related adjustments to campus operations this fall, we anticipate funds received in these areas will continue to decrease.<br/><br/>In areas experiencing increased costs directly related to COVID-19, our campus is pursuing Federal Emergency Management Agency claims for reimbursement to the extent possible. UCSC is also finalizing plans for spending our institutional CARES Act funds and the Minority Serving Institutions portion of CARES Act funding in support of increased costs related to transitioning to remote instruction, as required by the grant terms.<br/><br/><span size="4" style="font-size: large;">What this means for our employees</span><br/><br/>In spring 2020, the 10 UC chancellors committed to not having any COVID-19 related layoffs through the 2020 fiscal year, which ends today, June 30. This decision was made to provide some certainty to our employees during a very uncertain time. Though we cannot guarantee there will be no indefinite layoffs, we are working diligently to be strategic and creative to ensure we minimize to the greatest extent possible the need to use that strategy to address fiscal shortfalls over the next two years. I remain hopeful we will be able to utilize other means and can affirm that indefinite layoffs would be a last resort.<br/><br/>One of the strategies we have used to slow campus spending and decrease the commitment of permanent dollars is the position-management process. This has been working well over the past few months, and principal officers have been careful and conservative in reviewing open positions. We did not institute a hiring freeze, as we do need to fill certain positions that are critical to our core operations or those positions that can be revenue generating. In addition, principal officers have been asked to limit significant costs, and to be prudent with all spending to help reduce the need to lay off staff.<br/><br/>As revenue shortfalls impact certain services, the resulting service reductions or changes impact others. For example, during the summer months we typically furlough certain employees due to decreased demand for services. Though COVID-19 has resulted in additional service impacts, we have been able to avoid many furloughs through the redeployment of staff. We redeployed approximately 20 dining workers who would have otherwise been furloughed to support facilities. We continue to explore redeployment options in our custodial unit. In addition, we have found other creative ways to avoid furloughs and temporary layoffs in some areas. One such example is the county contract that Dining Services won to provide approximately 1,000 meals, daily, to local shelters and to emergency-service operations at 16 locations throughout north- and mid-Santa Cruz County beginning June 1. This was a win for the county, our campus, and our dining staff.<br/><br/>Other potential strategies we can deploy more broadly or are considering using to prevent the need for permanent layoffs include, but are not limited to:<br/></span>
<ul>
<li><span>Employee Reduction in Time (ERIT) program</span></li>
<li><span>Voluntary reductions in time/voluntary layoffs for career staff who are interested in transitioning from university employment</span></li>
<li><span>Transfers in lieu of layoff actions</span></li>
</ul>
<span color="#333333" style="color: #333333;">While all of these programs differ, they provide unique opportunities for staff to evaluate if changes in their employment best fit the needs of the employee and their families. As new strategies emerge, we will share those with you.<br/><br/>Though I know many questions remain, I hope this information is helpful. As we learn more about the budget, I will update you.</span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz faculty and staff</audience><admin>Chancellor's Office </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="d730604f80727017605850f72c770211"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2020/06/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/06/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1575568302141</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1575568302141</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
