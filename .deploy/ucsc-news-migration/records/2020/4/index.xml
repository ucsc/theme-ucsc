<p>These outstanding scholars are leaders in their fields, advocating for the humanities, pioneering sustainable food practices, making breakthroughs in biology and statistics, and nurturing the careers of future composers.&#160;</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, this year&#8217;s group of honorees would soon be returning to the campus that helped launch their careers as part of the Alumni Weekend celebration, which would have included an all-star panel and awards luncheon for these outstanding alumni.</p>
<p>However, this year&#8217;s celebration has been postponed to a future date after a review of the impacts of the coronavirus. In the meantime, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Graduate Division wants to share the stories of these far-ranging talents who have inspired their colleagues on campus, and gone on to contribute their skills and insights to the world.&#160;</p>
<p>The five graduate alumni honorees and the academic divisions they represent include the following:</p>
<p><strong>William&#160;&#8220;Bro&#8221; D. Adams<br/> </strong>Ph.D. history of consciousness&#160;&#8217;82<br/> Humanities Division</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2014/04/obaman-humanities-nomination.html">William D. Adams</a> has become an influential champion of the humanities since graduating from UC Santa Cruz. Looking back, he can see the way his time in graduate school has helped him in his career as an academic administrator.</p>
<p>&#8220;In particular, the breadth of my studies in the History of Consciousness program made it possible for me to understand and speak to individuals in all parts of the university&#8212;in the humanities, of course, but also in the social sciences and the natural sciences, as well,&#8221; Adams said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve also found that interdisciplinary thinking and competence are valuable not only for understanding various problems in the world. They&#8217;re also a wonderful platform for working with groups of people from all kinds of backgrounds on all kinds of practical issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adams was chair of the&#160;<a href="https://www.neh.gov/">National Endowment for the Humanities</a>&#160;from 2014 to 2017.</p>
<p>While serving in this role, he initiated several new grantmaking programs under the banner of&#160;<a href="https://www.neh.gov/news/press-release/2015-01-15/common-good">The Common Good: The Humanities in the Public Square</a>. Upon leaving NEH, Adams was named a Senior Fellow at the&#160;<a href="https://mellon.org/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>, where he continued his national advocacy on behalf of the humanities.</p>
<p>Prior to NEH, Adams served as president of&#160;<a href="http://www.colby.edu/">Colby College</a>&#160;from 2000 to 2014, president of&#160;<a href="https://www.bucknell.edu/">Bucknell University</a>&#160;from 1995 to 2000, and vice president and secretary of&#160;<a href="https://www.wesleyan.edu/">Wesleyan University</a>&#160;from 1988 to 1995. He taught political philosophy at the&#160;<a href="https://www.unc.edu/">University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill</a>, and at&#160;<a href="https://www.scu.edu/">Santa Clara University</a>, and coordinated the Great Works in Western Culture Program at&#160;<a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>.</p>
<p>Adams received his Ph.D. in the History of Consciousness Program at UC Santa Cruz and his B.A. in philosophy from Colorado College. He is currently working on a book about the French phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty and the painter Paul C&#233;zanne.</p>
<p>He has gone far in his career since leaving UC Santa Cruz, but getting this recent honor has made him look back on the place where he got his start.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have very good memories of my time at UCSC, and to be recognized for my professional work by an institution I admire is very meaningful,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><strong>Ernesto&#160;M&#233;ndez</strong><br/>Ph.D. environmental studies &#8217;04, Social Sciences Division</p>
<p>Professor of agroecology and environmental studies<br/> <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/">University of Vermont</a>,&#160;<a href="https://www.uvm.edu/environmentalprogram">Environmental Program<br/> </a>Interim chair<br/> <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/">University of Vermont</a>,&#160;<a href="https://www.uvm.edu/cals/pss">Department of Plant and Soil Science</a></p>
<p>When V. Ernesto&#160;M&#233;ndez was looking for Ph.D. options, the Environmental Studies Department at UC Santa Cruz was his first choice. He wanted to work in agroecology with Professor Stephen R. Gliessman, who instilled a deep commitment to serve farmers and students in tangible ways, and to go beyond research. The program&#8217;s interdisciplinary focus allowed M&#233;ndez to thrive.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<p>M&#233;ndez said his experience helped prepare him for his role as a professor of agroecology and environmental studies at the University of Vermont&#8217;s Environmental Program and interim chair of the Department of Plant and Soil Science, where he co-directs the&#160;<a href="http://www.uvm.edu/agroecology">Agroecology and Livelihoods Collaborative (ALC)</a>.</p>
<p>His research and teaching focus on agroecology, agrifood systems, participatory action research (PAR), and transdisciplinary research approaches.</p>
<p>At UVM he is also a faculty member of the&#160;<a href="https://www.uvm.edu/foodsystems/graduate_programs">Food Systems Graduate Program</a>, fellow and steering committee member of the&#160;<a href="https://www.uvm.edu/gund">Gund Institute for Environment</a>, and active in a variety of initiatives related to diversity, equity, and inclusion.&#160;</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, M&#233;ndez and his colleagues would grapple with the challenges of doing interdisciplinary research.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I learned how hard it is, but also that it is worth it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My graduate committee, made up by both natural and social scientists, challenged me to go deeper in both approaches. This taught me to be humble, but persistent and collaborative &#8230; Right now I am proud to say that transdisciplinary and participatory agroecology permeate all of my teaching, research, and outreach at the University of Vermont.&#8221;</p>
<p>He has over 25 years of experience working with farmers and indigenous communities in Latin America, and collaborating in agroecology efforts in a wide diversity of regions. This work has consolidated through the Agroecology and Livelihoods Collaborative, a community of practice that he co-directs with Martha Caswell.</p>
<p>Recently, these efforts have expanded across the world and currently include education and research initiatives in the Northeast U.S., Latin America, Africa, and Europe. He has authored or co-authored over 50 peer-reviewed articles and chapters, as well as edited&#160;three books. He was born and raised in El Salvador and maintains deep connections with his Central American roots.</p>
<p><strong>Danesh Moazed<br/> </strong>Ph.D. biology &#8217;89<br/> B.A. biology&#160;&#8217;85<br/> Physical and Biological Sciences Division</p>
<p>Professor of the Department of Cell Biology,&#160;<a href="https://moazed.hms.harvard.edu/">Moazed Lab<br/> </a><a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/">Harvard Medical School</a></p>
<p>Danesh Moazed&#8217;s graduate work had a transformative effect on the entire ribosome field, said his legendary mentor Harry Noller, now the Professor Emeritus of MCD Biology, the Robert L. Sinsheimer Professor of Molecular Biology, and director of the <a href="http://rna.ucsc.edu/">Center for Molecular Biology of RNA</a> at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</p>
<p>Moazed received both his undergraduate and Ph.D. degrees at UC Santa Cruz. During this time, he carried out research in Noller&#8217;s laboratory, working on the structure and function of the ribosome and publishing 17 papers in <em>Science</em>, <em>Nature,</em> <em>Cell</em>, and other prestigious peer-reviewed journals; in fact, he was first author on 10 of them.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Danesh was an exceptional student, not only remarkably bright and creative,&#160;but unusually focused and hard working,&#8221; Noller recalled. &#8220;On top of all this, he was a pleasure to have as a&#160;coworker in my lab."</p>
<p>Moazed went on to postdoctoral studies at UCSF with Drs. Patrick O'Farrell and Sandy Johnson. While working in their labs, he made significant contributions to the understanding of cell development and chromatin. He went on to join the faculty at&#160;<a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/">Harvard Medical School</a>&#160;in 1998, and in July 2008 was appointed a&#160;<a href="https://www.hhmi.org/programs/biomedical-research/investigator-program">Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator</a>.</p>
<p>Moazed&#8217;s research now focuses on chromatin biology and epigenetic inheritance&#8212;how organisms pass on changes to the next generation through modification of gene expression, rather than through alteration of the genetic code itself.&#160;</p>
<p>Specifically, he studies how the formation, function, and inheritance of heterochromatin in the cell&#8217;s nucleus exerts epigenetic control over gene transcription and how these changes are inherited and maintained when cells divide. He works primarily in yeast and combines approaches from biochemistry and cell biology with proteomics and genomics.</p>
<p>A highly cited author, Moazed has published more than 150 papers. He was elected to the&#160;<a href="https://www.amacad.org/">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>&#160;in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Taddy<br/> </strong>Ph.D. statistics and stochastic modeling&#160;&#8217;08<br/> Baskin School of Engineering</p>
<p>Vice president for economic technology and the North America chief economist<br/> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a></p>
<p>Matt Taddy is living proof that a proud Banana Slug can make his way in the world of big data. Taddy works in statistics, economics, and machine learning.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>From 2008 to 2018, he was professor of econometrics and statistics at the&#160;<a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/">University of Chicago Booth School of Business</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>Taddy ascribes much of this success to the solid preparation he received at UC Santa Cruz, with its multidisciplinary approach to learning, and the &#8220;engineer&#8217;s mindset&#8217;&#8217; he gained here. &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am super honored to get the award,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m also very proud to have a statistics Ph.D. from an engineering school, and the spirit of &#8216;building things&#8217; has served me well throughout my career.&#8221;</p>
<p>In recent years, the phenomena of big data, data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence have all risen to prominence.&#160;</p>
<p>In these cutting-edge fields, &#8220;a statistician is well served to have an engineer&#8217;s mindset,&#8221; Taddy said. &#8220;I got a lot more out of my time at UC Santa Cruz than just a degree in statistics.&#160;Through the open and multidisciplinary nature of the Baskin School, and the amazing collaborative culture that I encountered in the (at the time brand-new) Applied Math and Statistics Department, I learned that you don&#8217;t need to respect narrow academic boundaries and that you should seek out collaboration with partners who have very different skills and backgrounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>While at UC Santa Cruz, he worked on applications from fish ecology to climate research to aerospace design.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;This experience empowered me to dive into economics, an area I knew nothing about, when I joined the University of Chicago,&#8221; Taddy said.</p>
<p>In addition to his research work at Booth, he created their first class on big data, led the development of their data science curriculum, and was the recipient of teaching awards from both faculty and students.&#160;</p>
<p>Taddy has also worked in a variety of industry positions, including head of economics and data science for business AI at&#160;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft</a>, principal researcher at&#160;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research</a>, and a research fellow at&#160;<a href="https://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a>.&#160;He published&#160;<em>Business Data Science</em>&#160;in 2019 with McGraw-Hill, and is currently writing a book on leading through the adoption of artificial intelligence inside companies.</p>
<p>Taddy&#8217;s Ph.D. dissertation received an Honorable Mention for the&#160;<a href="https://bayesian.org/project/savage-award/">2009 Savage Award in Applied Methodology</a>.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Nicholas Vasallo<br/> </strong>D.M.A. music &#8217;11<br/> Arts Division</p>
<p>Director, music industry studies, AV technology, and music composition<br/> <a href="https://www.dvc.edu/">Diablo Valley College</a></p>
<p>Bay Area native <a href="https://magazine.ucsc.edu/2017/10/nick-vasallo-hitting-all-the-right-notes/">Nicholas Vasallo</a> picked up the electric guitar while in high school and formed Antagony, later credited as birthing the popular subgenre of metal music called &#8220;deathcore.&#8221;</p>
<p>A graduate of California State University, East Bay, Vasallo completed his doctorate at UC Santa Cruz, where he found a nurturing environment that supported his artistic growth and interests.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always felt like an outsider, and looking back at it, my professors really let me be who I was,&#8221; he said.&#160;</p>
<p>Vasallo&#8217;s primary composition instructor&#160;was David Evan Jones, who described Vasallo as &#8220;the most brilliant and accomplished composition student with whom I&#8217;ve had the pleasure to work .... I believe his work will continue to be recognized at the national and, going forward, the international levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He really took the time to understand my musical voice,&#8221; Vasallo said, describing his work with Jones. &#8220;In general, I think all of my teachers have also been my mentors, and that has influenced how I teach and mentor my students as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;As a student, I was always looking for the next peak, the next goal &#8230; the&#160;next thing I could conquer. As a teacher, I help my students reach their peaks and goals. And nowadays, I get more pleasure witnessing my students succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2010, he received the UC President&#8217;s Dissertation-Year Fellowship Award, the first arts student to receive that honor. Other honors include the&#160;<a href="http://theamericanprize.org/">American Prize</a>,&#160;<a href="https://compositionprize.weebly.com/">International Music Prize for Excellence in Composition</a>,&#160;<a href="http://www.macromusic.org/applications/winners.html">MACRO composition honorable mention</a>&#160;(2011), and the San Francisco Choral Artists New Voices award. He has helped make Diablo Valley College &#8220;California&#8217;s finest community college for music&#8221; and a top 10 Music Industry School in California.</p>
<p>Vasallo created the music composition programs at Diablo Valley College and Cal Poly Pomona. He has also taught at UC Santa Cruz, CSU East Bay, and Gavilan College. His students have gone on to successful careers as media composers, concert music composers, and graduate students at prestigious composition programs throughout the United States.&#160;</p>
<p>Vasallo is the recipient of the San Francisco Classical Voice Music Educator Award 2013. His music is published by Santa Barbara Music Publishers and available on Innova Recordings and Unique Leader.</p>
<p>Vasallo is also a passionate martial artist. In fact, his dissertation at UC Santa Cruz&#8212;which focused on the philosophy of eclecticism&#8212;had a chapter on the martial arts master Bruce Lee. Vasallo practices jiu jitsu and teaches Muay Thai kickboxing at Danville Jiu Jitsu, Wrestling, and Kickboxing. He is also the creator and head instructor of the Muay Thai program at Global Martial Arts University.</p>
<p>He lives in Danville, California, with his wife, Denise, and their two children, Madison and Lucas.</p>

Faculty are adapting to teaching classes online, and research labs have had to shut down much of their work.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many UCSC researchers are finding ways to apply their expertise to help combat the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We scientists have a hard time sitting at home twiddling our thumbs. We have the tools and technology, and we want to try and help,&#8221; said Rebecca DuBois, an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering with expertise in virology and vaccine development.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges in the United States has been the limited capacity for diagnostic testing to determine who is infected with the virus. Several campus labs have the technical capacity to do these tests, but not the regulatory approval needed to offer diagnostic tests for clinical use. Faculty with expertise in this area have been working with the Office of Research to figure out how they can best deploy their resources within the regulatory limits to help the campus and local community.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is well within our wheelhouse. We have all the instrumentation and the people we need to do it,&#8221; said Jeremy Sanford, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental (MCD) biology.</p>
<p>Sanford, together with Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry Michael Stone, Assistant Professor of MCD Biology Olena Vaske, and a team of other UCSC faculty, students, and staff, are working to establish a diagnostic testing lab at UCSC as quickly as possible to serve the immediate needs of the community during the pandemic. The team is currently working on receiving the necessary regulatory approvals. If successful, the UCSC testing lab has the potential to be the only facility capable of testing samples locally and turning around the results promptly, aiming for a turnaround time of within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Initially, they plan to conduct coronavirus testing for research and surveillance purposes, which they can do without the certification needed for diagnostic testing. This project would provide valuable information about the prevalence of coronavirus infections among people without symptoms in campus housing and potentially in the wider community. Their goal is to survey the campus and high-risk groups in the community, such as first responders and other essential workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would have to be anonymous, because without being a certified diagnostic lab we can&#8217;t return results to anyone,&#8221; Sanford explained. &#8220;But it&#8217;s a way to get started, and it can tell us what the prevalence is in asymptomatic people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, faculty in several departments have launched research projects that could lead to better and faster diagnostic tests, improved understanding of the virus and how the immune system responds to it, and a better sense of the future course of the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Rapid diagnostics</strong><br/>Holger Schmidt, professor of electrical and computer engineering, has developed novel optical sensing technologies for biomedical diagnostics, and he is now adapting his &#8220;optofluidic chip&#8221; technology to provide rapid detection of the coronavirus. Nader Pourmand, professor of biomolecular engineering, was contacted by a health insurance company to develop a rapid coronavirus test that could be performed at pharmacies, and he is now working on this through a startup company based at the Startup Sandbox biotech incubator in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Any new diagnostic technology would have to undergo testing for validation and regulatory approval before it could be mass produced and deployed for clinical use. This new coronavirus may be with us for a long time, however, so improved diagnostics, with faster results and more widespread availability, could play an important role in later stages of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Immunologic testing, which involves detecting antibodies in blood samples to know if someone has already been exposed to the coronavirus, could also be important in managing the pandemic. Antibody tests require coronavirus antigens, the proteins on the surface of the virus particles that trigger an immune response. DuBois&#8217; lab has the ability to make those antigens, and after learning they were in short supply she began production and will provide them for use by other researchers through a national repository maintained by the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>DuBois said her lab may also begin doing some antibody testing for the campus or local community. &#8220;A lot of people are going to be wondering if they were already exposed to this virus. That mild fever or sore throat they had&#8212;was that it? And understanding how many people on campus or in the community are positive for antibodies can be informative for making decisions on how to safely transition back to normal life while minimizing the risk of new infections,&#8221; DuBois said. &#8220;If I can do some screening of local samples to see if people have been exposed, that is one way I can help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marm Kilpatrick, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology who studies infectious disease dynamics, says people should be prepared for life to be different for the next year, and possibly longer. Features of COVID-19 that make it hard to control include its transmission rate and the fact that people without symptoms can spread the infection.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the current numbers are correct, it means each case can give rise to 2.5 new cases every five to six days,&#8221; Kilpatrick said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why it can move so fast, and there&#8217;s a delay between infection and getting sick, so the switch from things looking fine to hospitals being overwhelmed can happen really quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stay-at-home orders now in effect are intended to slow the rate of spread of the disease, but they are having crippling effects on the economy. Kilpatrick said it may be possible to begin loosening restrictions if the initial lock-down period succeeds in keeping the number of cases down to a manageable level.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to get to where there are few enough cases that you can do contact tracing and test everyone who had contact with each case. But high-capacity testing is crucial,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><strong>Genome sequencing</strong><br/>In February, soon after other labs had determined the genome sequence of the new coronavirus, researchers at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute posted the sequence on the UCSC Genome Browser and began analyzing and annotating the coronavirus genome. Mark Akeson, professor of biomolecular engineering, is working on rapid sequencing of coronavirus samples using the nanopore sequencing technology he helped pioneer. By sequencing virus samples taken at different times and places, researchers can track genetic changes and trace the spread of different strains of the virus.</p>
<p>The availability of data on the UCSC Genome Browser has enabled Nikolaos Sgourakis, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and his graduate students to develop computational and experimental tools to identify and characterize hundreds of viral peptides that could be targeted by the immune system. His lab has developed a new technology to create a library of targets for studying T cell responses to the virus. Scientists still have a lot to learn about how the immune system responds to this novel virus and why the severity of the disease varies so much among individuals. Sgourakis&#8217;s findings could be used to design suitable peptide vaccines for high-risk groups. In addition, he said, this research could lead to a T-cell-based diagnostic test, with the potential to predict whether a patient&#8217;s adaptive immune response will be able to clear the virus.</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of the many ways in which researchers at UC Santa Cruz are responding to the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;People have really risen to the challenge,&#8221; said Isabel Bjork, executive director of the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute. &#8220;There is so much expertise here, and so much desire on the part of staff and researchers to make a difference. People are spending nights and weekends trying to make all this happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an extraordinary time that has brought unprecedented changes to the lives and work of the entire campus community. Both Kilpatrick and DuBois, however, say they were not surprised by the emergence of this new disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any virologist would tell you it was just a matter of time,&#8221; DuBois said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a perfect example of what we&#8217;ve all been talking about for a couple of decades now,&#8221; added Kilpatrick. &#8220;These outbreaks are rare, though, so people don&#8217;t worry enough to really be prepared for it.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="372dbc9d807270174e35fdbd1d51cb1c"><name>moving-services-to-pack-and-ship-belongings</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Moving Services to Pack and Ship Belongings</title><summary>If you have already left campus and are unable to return to retrieve your belongings personally, you may need to contract with a personal moving service to pack your belongings and ship them to you.</summary><start-date>1585724400000</start-date><display-name>Moving Services to Pack and Ship Belongings</display-name><path>/2020/04/moving-services-to-pack-and-ship-belongings</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/04/moving-services-to-pack-and-ship-belongings</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1585768676480</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594757245260</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p align="left">Dear Student,</p>

<p><span>An accurate 2020 census will help UC Santa Cruz immensely, and campus needs your help to ensure that happens!</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span>The census, which is undertaken only once a decade, helps determine federal funding for many campus areas including adult education, science education, wellness, health and mental health services, and financial aid. Many of these federally funded programs and services aid our most vulnerable. An accurate count of students will ensure these valuable programs and services continue. Here&#8217;s how you can help:</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span>If you live on campus in student housing or other group quarters (or did, until recently), sit tight. Census Bureau employees are working with campus officials to ensure you are counted. You are not being asked to register at this time, but please pay attention to additional emails that may have further instruction. Do not register online yet or be counted at an address other than your address at UCSC. That means your family should not count you on their census form even if you are currently living at your permanent home due to COVID-19.&#160;</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span>If you live off campus, you can fill out the census now, either by phone, mail, or online. Students living off campus should already have received instructions by mail on how to fill out the census. We urge you to visit <a href="http://my2020census.gov/">my2020census.gov</a> to learn more. You can even fill out your census form there if you&#8217;d like. It is essential that you fill out the census questionnaire using your address when at UC Santa Cruz, whether or not you are now away due to COVID-19. This matches what Census Bureau officials are asking.&#160;</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span>Remember, every student counted is important, with millions of dollars in financial aid, wellness and education funding ultimately at stake.&#160;</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span>And just so you know, the Census Bureau does not ask whether you or anyone in your home is a U.S. citizen. The Census Bureau is also not allowed to publicly release your responses in any way that could identify you. They do not share information with law enforcement or immigration officials. The information from the census is used to determine funding for important services provided to both citizens and noncitizens.&#160;</span></p>

<p>Reardon, the director of the <a href="https://scijust.ucsc.edu/">Science and Justice Research Center</a> at UC Santa Cruz and a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/01/reardon-hastings.html">leading scholar</a> of genomics and medical ethics, said the pandemic has been "decades in the making," rooted in profound ecological disturbance and climate change, as well as the gutting of public health infrastructure and&#8212;public governance itself&#8212;amidst the ravages of "hyper-capitalism."</p>
<p>"This isn't a temporary hold on normal life," said Reardon. "It would be more accurate to think of this as a complete reconstitution of what is going to be counted as normal."</p>
<p>Climate change is a "public health problem," according to Reardon, noting that industrialization, habitat destruction, and climate change make pandemics more likely. But the crisis is revealing fissures not only in the ecological world, but in the human domain, as well. Lack of government preparedness in this country, underscored by the lack of coronavirus tests and protective equipment like masks, has focused discontent on the Trump administration, but Reardon said it would be a mistake to focus too much attention on critiquing Trump. "Obama gutted the public health infrastructure, too," she said. "We all need to take responsibility for what's going on. Everybody has a role to play here, and everybody has responsibility."</p>
<p><em><u>Governance</u></em></p>
<p>Public health experts have been worried for years about the outbreak of new emerging diseases, and fears of a global pandemic represent the worst-case scenario. The coronavirus crisis has been aggravated by a backdrop of governance that has skewed too far in the direction of private property and individual rights, according to Reardon.</p>
<p>"We need to reassess, fundamentally, how we're governing ourselves," she said. "We can't rely on private industry. We need a government. We need public infrastructure. Pandemics require collective responses. There has to be some sort of correction."</p>
<p>Reardon described the "perversion" of policies put in place for the public good, citing an attempt by the biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences Inc., to receive a government tax break for the development of a drug, Remdesivir, that could be useful against COVID-19. But the "orphan drug" tax break is available only for diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people, so the timing of Gilead's application is critical&#8212;and unclear.</p>
<p>"When pressed to state the day they filed their request, they wouldn't give up this information," said Reardon, adding that Gilead faced pressure to rescind its application for the tax break, something it did last Wednesday.</p>
<p>Which gets to the issue of trust, said Reardon. "There's information, and there's the matter of trust," she said. "It's not just public versus private, it's how the constitution of the public has been so perverted in our country with its hyper-capitalist focus that many people have lost their trust in public government."</p>
<p>Similarly, officials with the Centers for Disease Control cannot relay information to the public about what companies are doing to address the pandemic, because it's considered proprietary information. "They can't share critically important information," said Reardon. Beyond the biology of the coronavirus, this pandemic is "making visible deep problems that are now being felt widely by everyone."</p>
<p>The public must be vigilant, ensuring that economic bailouts don't overlook those with greatest need. The public must also watch out for what Reardon calls "disaster authoritarianism" as leaders try to implement policies they want, regardless of whether they directly address the pandemic, such as closing off borders.</p>
<p>"I'm calling it the <em>pandemicene</em>, because this is going to re-work everything," said Reardon. "We are going to be asking fundamental questions about how we order ourselves. This pandemic is forcing us to reckon with those questions, and that's all to the good. We shouldn't think any of this is temporary."</p>
<p><em><u>Discrimination</u></em></p>
<p>Reardon also rejected descriptions of the coronavirus as the "China virus," saying that how we characterize the virus matters. "We're already seeing discrimination against people who seem to be from that part of the world," she said. "There are numbers on that."</p>
<p>Accuracy matters, and inaccuracy persists: the so-called Spanish Flu of 1918 actually originated in Kansas, she noted.</p>
<p>Reardon wonders how communities that have historically not been treated well by the government are responding to government orders to social distance or shelter in place. "There's a huge problem of trust," she said.</p>
<p>Finally, discriminating between those infected with coronavirus and those who are not begs uncomfortable and challenging questions about who receives treatment and of what type, as hospitals and doctors confront the scarcity of supplies and equipment like ventilators.</p>
<p>"Discrimination is the basic capacity to distinguish between this and that, but that capacity is shaped by values," said Reardon. "There will be many forms of discrimination as we move forward, and their consequences will grow weightier."</p>
<p><em><u>Stockpiles or high-tech science?</u></em></p>
<p>The pandemic has exposed regulatory uncertainties regarding whether the Food and Drug Administration has the authority to regulate testing for things like coronavirus&#8212;or genomic testing, a subject Reardon has examined in great depth.</p>
<p>It has also shone a light on deficient stockpiles of basic health care materials, including swabs, goggles, and dry ice. "What you need in a pandemic, first and foremost, is those basics," said Reardon. "We need high-tech science, but we also need the public health infrastructure and goggles and masks. We need people in those different worlds to work together, to see themselves as needing one another."</p>
<p>As a result, the crisis may also reconfigure ideas of what it means to help, she noted. "As scientists and scholars, we may have a greater capacity to respond to the needs of people rather than to work in our own exact area," she said.</p>
<p><em><u>Spring quarter seminar </u></em></p>
<p>Reardon is tracking the pandemic closely, and teaching a class about it this quarter.</p>
<p>"I wasn't supposed to be teaching this quarter, but I'm not sitting this out," said Reardon. "The world is changing, and if you're going to be part of what comes after, you've got to be a part of it now."</p>
<p>The upper-division seminar, <em>Living and Learning in a Pandemic</em>, is an outgrowth of her winter quarter class, <em>Sociology of Health and Medicine</em>. "I was totally primed," she said. "A lot of students found that class really helpful. I like to use contemporary examples, and coronavirus was in the news. Our last class meeting was cancelled when we got word that the campus was shutting down."</p>
<p>Several students expressed interest in a follow-up class&#8212;a "part two," said Reardon. "It's a really stressful time. They wanted to learn and stay focused on what's going on around them."</p>
<p>The class also gives Reardon a window on how the pandemic is unfolding in communities across the state and beyond. "I can learn from my students what's going on where they live," she said. "When you tap into what your students have to offer, you can learn a lot."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3c1e9a28807270174e35fdbd47fe811b"><name>martin-pandemic</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Grow your own veggies?

<p>"I always say, vegetables are food for the body, and flowers are food for the spirit and soul," said Martin, manager of the Alan Chadwick Garden at UCSC.</p>
<p>Timing is good, with temperatures warming up, and local nurseries stocked with seeds and seedlings&#8212;and many offering curbside pickup, too.</p>
<p>"In spring, it's almost a biological impulse: People get the urge to garden," said Martin, who recently celebrated his <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/07/martin-anniversary.html">40th anniversary</a> with the UCSC Farm and Garden. "It's a good thing. You get recreation, exercise, focus, diversion, contemplation, meditation, a little workout. And in this mild climate, we can grow cool- and warm-weather crops almost side by side."</p>
<p>With no further ado, here are Martin's tips for success:</p>
<p><em><u>Vegetables</u></em></p>
<p>Martin suggests starting with <a href="https://casfs.ucsc.edu/documents/for-the-gardener/salad_mix.pdf">salad mix</a>, and he encourages gardeners to grow what they like: a mix of kale, Asian greens, lettuce&#8212;whatever they enjoy. Pre-mixed seed blends are available commercially, or you can "mix your own."</p>
<p>Seeds are small and should be sown directly into the ground, as evenly as possible. "Not haphazard, about 1/4-inch apart," he recommends. "It's better to over-sow than under-sow&#8212;within reason! Do your best and forget the rest."</p>
<p>Cover seeds with a thin layer of fine soil, then sprinkle daily. Seedlings emerge in 3-5 days and should be ready to cut in about 21 days. Salad greens should be 3-4" tall before you head outside with scissors in hand to harvest your first crop.</p>
<p>"Just grab a handful and cut it at the base," he said. "Leave enough that the plants will re-sprout and grow back. You can get two, three, or even four cuttings per plot."</p>
<p>And if you sow seed every 7-10 days, you'll have tender baby greens all summer long.</p>
<p><em>Pro tip</em>: Martin really likes including an endive called <a href="https://www.johnnyseeds.com/vegetables/chicory/endive/bianca-riccia-endive-seed-2183.html">Bianca Riccia</a> in salad mix. It's slow and "a little difficult," but worth it, he said.</p>
<p>This is also the perfect time to plant head lettuce, radicchio, Asian and European cabbages, broccoli, cauliflower, leeks, scallions, potatoes, and winter and summer squash. Martin, who received special dispensation to tend the Chadwick Garden during the coronavirus shutdown, admits he has planted 19 varieties of winter squash. He's not convinced broccoli and cauliflower justify the space they require, given that each plant yields just one head: "I'm not sure that's worth it on the home front." But plant what you like, he reiterates.</p>
<p>Anticipating summer's bounty, Martin highlights eggplant, cucumbers, tomatoes, tomatillos, beans, and basil. Bush beans are popular, but Martin prefers pole beans, which quickly cover a trellis, providing a bonus screen or hedge where desired&#8212;"and they're easier to pick!"</p>
<p>There are dozens of basils to choose from, but Genovese is the best of the green basils. Martin gets rhapsodic describing the wonders of lemon basil added to a stir-fry or a clear broth soup. "Look for Mrs. Burns lemon basil," he urged.</p>
<p><em>Pro tips</em>: "I love all the Italian flat beans&#8212;Romano Musica is wonderful&#8212;but the great unsung, underappreciated bean is the scarlet runner bean. The flowers attract hummingbirds, and it's a perennial that comes back from a tuber like a dahlia. The beans are great dried, too. Dried, they are exquisitely colored, jet black with a sprinkling of pink&#8212;almost too beautiful to throw in the soup tureen."</p>
<p><em><u>Root crops</u></em></p>
<p>Root crops need to be sown directly into the ground, rather than transplanted as seedlings. Martin recommends radishes, carrots, beets, rutabagas ("If you like 'em"), and turnips&#8212;especially a Japanese variety, <a href="https://www.johnnyseeds.com/vegetables/turnips/hakurei-f1-turnip-seed-706.html">Hakurei</a>.</p>
<p>When planting, picture the width of the "shoulder" of the crop, and place the seeds a little closer. "So an inch or so for carrots, and three or four inches apart for beets," said Martin.</p>
<p>If seeds are sown too close together, they will need to be thinned, and it's easy to injure seedlings that are left in the ground.</p>
<p><em>Pro tip</em>: "Always sow a little more for the birds, snails, and slugs," said Martin. To <a href="https://casfs.ucsc.edu/documents/for-the-gardener/snail_control.pdf">manage snails and slugs</a>, keep the garden tidy by removing debris and mulch. If all else fails, try an organic snail bait like Sluggo. Birds are a seasonal issue, and although many are about to migrate away from the Central Coast, a little bird netting can help protect tender seedlings until they're sturdy enough to survive losing a leaf or two to a sparrow.</p>
<p><em><u>Flowers</u></em></p>
<p>And then there are <a href="https://casfs.ucsc.edu/about/publications/for_the_gardener.html">flowers</a>. Flowers to feed the soul, grace the table, and attract bees and butterflies to pollinate your veggies.</p>
<p>Martin's list of <a href="https://casfs.ucsc.edu/documents/for-the-gardener/easy_annuals.pdf">easy and carefree flowers</a> starts with calendula, cornflower, and forget-me-nots, moves on to sweet William, pincushion flower and statice, and wraps up with the stars of the summer show: aster, cosmos, zinnia, and sunflowers.</p>
<p><em><u>Compost</u></em></p>
<p>Martin implores every gardener, novice and experts alike, to <a href="https://casfs.ucsc.edu/documents/for-the-gardener/quality-compost.pdf">build a compost pile</a> twice a year. "You just need a good amount of greens and some carbon&#8212;a little leaves, or straw, or even wood chips," he said. In spring, even weeds that grew over the winter are fair game--as long as they don't have mature seeds. "Weeds are amazing cyclers of nutrients and biomass," he said.</p>
<p>Building a compost pile can be daunting at first, but like weeding a garden bed, it's satisfying. "You start here, then look back and realize you're done," he said. "It an amazing sense of satisfaction. Then you let it go. You let it rot."</p>
<p><em><u>Summer cover crops</u></em></p>
<p>And if summer vegetables aren't your thing, Martin offers two tips for <a href="https://casfs.ucsc.edu/documents/for-the-gardener/choosing-cover-crops.pdf">cover crops</a> that will keep your soil healthy until you're ready to get back at it: buckwheat and sorghum.</p>
<p>Buckwheat is an amazing "green manure" that grows about knee high, requires no irrigation, and is virtually indestructible plant. "It would grow in sidewalk cracks, that's how tough it is," he said. "It goes from seed to flower in 30-40 days. It really improves the soil."</p>
<p>Sorghum is almost the opposite, shooting up to heights of 8-10 feet in only 5-6 weeks. "It creates almost scary biomass, and you can irrigate&#8212;or not," he said.</p>

Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The Goldwater Scholarship is a prestigious national competition for undergraduates in the fields of mathematics, science, and engineering. The scholarships provide up to $7,500 per year for sophomores and juniors from across the country to cover the costs of tuition, fees, books, and other expenses.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The foundation awarded 396 scholarships this year, selecting the scholars on the basis of academic merit from a field of 1,343 students nominated by representatives of colleges and universities nationwide.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Yunerman has been doing research on planet formation with Ruth Murray-Clay, associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics, and graduate student Diana Powell. Her project addresses one of the major outstanding questions in planet formation: How do the building blocks of planets grow from cosmic dust to &#8220;planetesimals&#8221; with sizes larger than meters without first being destroyed by collisions or drifting into their host stars? </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Yunerman is currently co-president of the Women in Physics &amp; Astrophysics (WiPA) group at UC Santa Cruz. In her sophomore year, she was the outreach officer for WiPA, organizing events for elementary, middle, and high school students and creating materials, such as lesson plans and outlines, to be used by future outreach officers. She has also led workshops and done peer mentoring for other undergraduates.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Yunerman plans to pursue a Ph.D. in astrophysics in preparation for a career doing research in planetary astrophysics.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The Barry M.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hundreds of donors have kicked in more than $81,000 to boost the ongoing </span><a href="https://ucscslugsupport.communityfunded.net/?cfpage=project&amp;project_id=35369&amp;t=1585850932"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 Slug Support Campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">helping students in dire need because of the ongoing coronavirus crisis.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, 246 donors have contributed to this </span><a href="https://ucscslugsupport.communityfunded.net/?cfpage=project&amp;project_id=35369&amp;t=1585850932"><span style="font-weight: 400;">important fundraiser</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> going toward </span><a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/slug-support/program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Slug Support Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which helps bridge financial gaps during periods of distress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slug Support is especially timely for students who come from families that are struggling financially, or find themselves needing tech access that will help them continue learning at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This crowdfunding campaign officially launched on March 31&#8212;and the momentum keeps building, said Emily Denning Todd, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">assistant director of annual and digital giving, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who is leading the charge for this campaign.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donating to this cause is </span><a href="https://ucscslugsupport.communityfunded.net/?cfpage=project&amp;project_id=35369&amp;t=1585849539"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as easy as clicking on a button</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;and every dollar counts. One donor kicked in $1,500 in a matching-fund challenge&#8212;and is close to reaching this goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A wide range of Slugs are helping this campaign.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Although the majority of gifts have been from UC Santa Cruz alumni, the campaign has received an outpouring of support from all kinds of Banana Slugs,&#8221; Todd said. &#8220;Alumni, staff, students, and faculty are all coming together to help those students who need our support to get through this difficult time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Assistant Vice Provost for Student Success Gwynn Benner has been facilitating the launch of a new laptop lending program called&#160; Slug Tech as part of this campaign. She said the COVID-19 Slug Support fundraising campaign is helping anxious and overwhelmed students, including those who are living at homes facing severe financial pressures.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They are in home environments where they are being called on to provide more support,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They may have loved ones who are not working because they have been laid off, along with millions of Americans applying for unemployment,&#8221; Benner continued. &#8220;They come from families who are struggling to make ends meet. Families are particularly impacted when the parents are service workers for businesses such as hotels, and suddenly they&#8217;re out of work.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many students do not own a laptop or have access to a computer at home, or are returning to homes without ready access to WiFi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who remain on campus face serious challenges of their own. Those without personal computers can no longer rely on access at UC Santa Cruz computer labs and libraries because both have been shuttered during the COVID-19 crisis.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Slug Support Director Mariah Lyons spoke about vulnerable students living on and off campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In general we are seeing a lot of students who have suddenly lost income and are now facing basic need insecurities such as the ability to purchase groceries or pay their rent,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lyons recently spoke with one student who was laid off from a restaurant job, losing a source of money that covered most of the rent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the face of these issues, this fundraiser will help students on several fronts:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Providing food stability for students through digital gift cards, Instacart purchases, and meal swipes to campus dining halls that remain open. Slug Support also connects students to CalFresh for long-term food needs and supports campus food pantries, which remain open for students in need.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Funding students in dire need of emergency housing and providing rent support for students who may have lost wages due to reduced work hours.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Connecting Slug Support case managers to students who may be in isolation/quarantine to address their needs.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Providing distance learning resources through Slug Tech. Slug Tech is working to ship students new laptops, assist in internet booster needs, and provide additional technology to help students function during this time of remote learning.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Supporting students who have returned home or taken a leave of absence by connecting them to their local resources for health insurance, mental health services, and unemployment benefits.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our students have worked hard for their achievements, and we're so proud of them,&#8221; Todd said. &#8220;Together, we can ensure that they have the resources they need to be safe, well, and successful.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

<br/><span>We write today to acknowledge a new reality and to announce our decision to do all we can to support our UC family during this unprecedented time.</span>
<div><br/>The novel coronavirus has now affected everyone on the planet in some way, and by all indications, we can expect more disruption in the weeks ahead. We are keenly aware of the health concerns and economic uncertainty weighing on the entire University community. Let us assure you: we are in this together.<br/><br/></div>
<div>Our people are the heart of the University of California and allow UC to live up to our aspirations and values. As we face the personal and professional challenges of the day, we are committed to doing all we can to alleviate concerns about income or job stability during this time.<br/><br/></div>
<div><strong>To that end, today we collectively announce that there will be no COVID-19 related layoffs for all career employees through the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2020.<span>&#160;</span></strong>Providing pay and health and welfare benefits during this period will allow employees to more effectively care for themselves and their families as we all support California and the nation by staying home and doing our part to reduce the spread of this virus.<br/><br/></div>
<div>To those of you who are performing critical services in the community, caring for our patients and continuing to teach and conduct research, we could not be more grateful for your hard work, courage, and dedication to serving the public good in this turbulent time.</div>
<div><br/>To UC employees on our campuses, administrative offices, and clinical settings who are unable to work because of facility closures, curtailed operations, or other disruptions due to COVID-19, we are committed to supporting you as long as we are able. We look forward to working with our unions to redeploy workers to areas of need and keep as many employees working as possible.</div>
<div><br/>While there may still be reductions in hours, and in some cases staff, as a part of our typical student and career employee summer staffing and clinical workforce adjustments, we are committed to doing our best to keep people earning a paycheck whenever possible. The University will also begin conversations with various employee groups to consider the conditions under which we may be able to extend this promise of job protection beyond June 30th, should that be necessary.</div>
<div><br/>Local HR departments will be working in real time to address questions from employees. We cannot predict exactly how the situation will evolve, or what future measures we may need to take to uphold our mission. What we do know is that we will face that future with courage and find our way together.<br/><br/></div>

Instead, he approached the Peruvian government about developing an app to improve "contact tracing" to protect people from COVID-19. Then he helped lead the effort that culminated with the app&#8217;s release just three weeks later.</p>
<p>L&#243;pez Vargas worked around the clock with academics, the government, and technology companies to develop the phone-based app and accompanying probability models. With the endorsement of the government, the app <em>PeruEnTusManos</em> was launched April 3 and already has one million users.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The public has welcomed this tool and appreciates that the government took decisive action to implement a nationwide lockdown early,&#8221; said L&#243;pez Vargas. "It's super scary. My family is there."</p>
<p>L&#243;pez Vargas, an assistant professor of economics who joined the faculty in 2015, said the effort got underway about three weeks ago.&#160;</p>
<p>Contact tracing is the main strategy used to fight epidemics once containment is no longer possible. It's a labor-intensive method that begins when an individual tests positive for infection; health care professionals &#8220;traceback&#8221; that person's contacts and notify everyone the infected individual had contact with so they can isolate themselves and help contain the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>"When a virus is spreading fast, manual tracing becomes impossible, because human resources can only scale linearly," said L&#243;pez Vargas. "The coronavirus is growing exponentially."</p>
<p>Hence the need for a high-tech tool.</p>
<p>With a background in experimental and behavioral economics, as well as expertise in statistical modeling, L&#243;pez Vargas is part of a team of over 30&#160; engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians, and epidemiologists in Peru and elsewhere developed a piece of highly engineered software to do the time-consuming work of contact tracing.</p>
<p>The idea is to twofold: Create a database that holds fine-grained records of where individuals have been so if someone tests positive for coronavirus, it will be possible to trace their steps for the 14 days prior to infection&#8212;in five-minute increments gathered from cell phone GPS positions.</p>
<p>The second part involves probability; the app alerts others who were in those same locations that they had come in near contact with someone who later became infected, calculating their risk based on juxtaposition and length of exposure. "If they meet a certain threshold, they would receive instructions to be tested," said L&#243;pez Vargas.</p>
<p>For those who opt in, phones submit the information anonymously to the central database, where comparisons and risk assessments are made automatically.</p>
<p>"Several countries are using this technology," he said. "Singapore&#8217;s government has implemented a tool similar to ours. Some technology is more invasive than others. We need to weigh the power of data and the rights of privacy."</p>
<p>At least two other Western teams&#8212;one based at MIT and another in Europe&#8212;are developing high-tech tools for digital, or massive, contact tracing, according to L&#243;pez Vargas, adding that government-led efforts in China and Korea are more secretive.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Digital contact tracing relies on the support of the public and the endorsement of the government, and trust is integral to both, said L&#243;pez Vargas, who notes that informal surveys prior to the app&#8217;s release revealed significant support for the idea.</p>
<p>"You're being tracked, but you get very concrete benefits," he said. "It's also true that we should be very careful regarding privacy. The debate is super active right now, and it depends on the amount of government trust people have in different countries." L&#243;pez Vargas maintains that it would be "nearly impossible" for a bad agent to utilize this information for other purposes.</p>
<p>The MIT-based team's tool puts "privacy first," not gathering information from phones but rather notifying users about the past location of currently known cases, so they could use their devices to go back and do their own contact tracing. But that approach comes with tradeoffs, said L&#243;pez Vargas. "That leaves it up to the citizen to get the information and to decide what to do with it," he said. "And there's little information for the response team about the scope and size of risk. It doesn't utilize all the power of the information."</p>
<p>L&#243;pez Vargas acknowledges that the massive contact tracing approach wouldn't fly in an outbreak of normal flu because of privacy concerns. "But in this situation, with the tradeoff in loss of life, economic impact, and privacy, there's support for it," he said.</p>
<p>"The size of the shock the world is experiencing now is bigger than we can even imagine," he added. "I am hoping we'll help slow down the pandemic."</p>

<p align="left">On Sunday, March 29th, you received a notification that you may be required to move from your current campus residence to another space on campus for the remainder of the spring quarter. While the exact date of relocation and details related to your specific assignment have not yet been determined, we want to share more with you about why these moves are necessary. Our highest priority is supporting the health and well-being of our campus community.</p>
<p align="left">In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 7,000 students have cancelled their on-campus housing contracts, dramatically reducing our residential population. While we would normally house nearly 9,000 students, the student population on-campus is now approximately 1,200 with an additional 800 people residing in the Family Student Housing complex and in Employee housing.</p>
<p align="left"><u>Students will continue to reside in:</u><br/>College Nine Residence Halls and Apartments<br/>College Ten Residence Halls and Apartments<br/>Crown Residence Halls and Apartments<br/>Merrill Residence Halls and Apartments<br/>College Apartment communities (with the exception of Porter Bldg F and all Cowell Apartments)<br/>Redwood Grove Apartments<br/>Graduate Housing Apartments<br/>Family Student Housing<br/>Camper Park</p>
<p align="left"><u>Residential areas that will no longer have student residents during Spring 2020:</u><br/>Porter College Residence Halls and the Transfer Community<br/>Porter College Apartments, Bldg F<br/>Rachel Carson Residence Halls<br/>Oakes College Residence Halls<br/>Cowell College Residence Halls<br/>Cowell College Apartments<br/>Stevenson College Residence Halls<br/>The Village<br/>University Town Center</p>
<p align="left">We fully acknowledge these relocations are stressful and come with a feeling of community loss, and we do not take the decision to make such a requirement lightly. As indicated in your housing agreement, the University maintains the right to assign or reassign you to any university-sponsored residence space that is available. Given the current health crisis, there are many factors contributing to why a relocation is necessary at this time.</p>
<p align="left">Our overarching priority is the safety and well-being of all our students remaining on campus. We plan to relocate students to promote and increase physical distancing, as described by the state and county stay in place orders, while also making sure we have staff available to support the needs of our residential community.</p>
<p align="left">As we seek to reduce the spread of COVID-19, we want to ensure we have space available to help in our response.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Supporting the health of our residential community:</strong><span>&#160;</span>We are establishing space on campus where UCSC students and employees may be quarantined or isolated should they become ill. These spaces will be held at the Village, the University Town Center, and Cowell College apartments. Because students in quarantine or isolation have a need for a private residence and private bathroom, we need to have available the ability to utilize all three of these communities for our own campus community needs. We do not wish to have students sharing residential space where another student who is ill may be placed next door to isolate.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Supporting our community:</strong>Given the evolving nature of this pandemic and its profound impact on local communities, we are working with the county and other agencies to identify community space needs. The entire UC system is working with their local communities to identify partnerships that support public health needs during this pandemic. We feel this is best for our community, and the broader Santa Cruz community&#8217;s needs, to make available completely vacated buildings which is why we cannot continue to have students in residence in these locations.</p>
<p align="left">Additional factors include:</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Ensuring quality service:</strong>Given the significant reduction in available custodial staffing due to COVID-19, localizing residence hall students within the four designated colleges allows us to more effectively deploy the limited custodial resources currently available.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Providing appropriate staff support:</strong>We are better able to effectively staff our housing communities and provide safety and security for our students in consolidated locations.</p>
<p align="left">What are the ways in which we will coordinate this relocation effort?</p>
<ul>
<li align="left">Students with disability-related accommodations will have their accommodation honored in their new assignment.</li>
<li align="left">Students in Cowell College apartments will have priority to relocate to the Stevenson Apartments. Students in Porter Building F will have priority placement in other Porter Apartments.</li>
<li align="left">Students in college residence halls will have the ability to move to the apartments in their college should they wish to do so. For example, Porter Residence Hall students will be given the opportunity to move to the Porter Apartments. Students who move from the residence halls to the apartments will not have a required meal plan, though they certainly may opt to purchase a meal plan of their choice. If you are currently living in a residence hall and wish to move to the apartments, please contact your<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://housing.ucsc.edu/contact/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1586361306728000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFsaoo7nEYbJ2zrf68zED3H-Jkxw" href="https://housing.ucsc.edu/contact/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Housing Coordinator</a>.</li>
<li align="left">Students who wish to or need to remain in a residence hall facility will be relocated to College Nine, College Ten, Crown College or Merrill College.</li>
<li align="left">All students will be assigned to private rooms but charged at the triple room rate.</li>
<li align="left">Relocation assistance, including moving vans for distant travel, boxes, tape, labels, etc. will be provided.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Students who submit their<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIwZgQtIfFLxRSzh03rHmVYqYonNja0X9FJ-UV8HKlYn5QIA/viewform&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1586361306728000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGltmSMeMd-cSIXoz6_0Al5xTihPA" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIwZgQtIfFLxRSzh03rHmVYqYonNja0X9FJ-UV8HKlYn5QIA/viewform" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Intent to Vacate</a><span>&#160;</span>and complete their move-out (i.e. remove all belongings and return any university keys) by April 19 will be eligible for a full refund of any housing and dining fees paid for spring quarter. Anyone who is still in residence after this date should plan to be reassigned to a new residential location.</p>
<p align="left">As a reminder, the county health directive instructs that public and private gatherings outside of an immediate household are prohibited. An immediate household is not all residents who may reside in a building together, in a community together or even in close proximity. Your immediate household is defined as your private bedroom. We are intentionally assigning students to single occupancy rooms in order to safely practice physical distancing. Guests will not be permitted to visit within a student&#8217;s residence.</p>
<p align="left">Because it will take a bit of time for all residences to be vacated and prepared for new occupancy, we are uncertain of the exact date/time of your move. You will receive, in advance of any move, specific instructions related to your relocation.</p>
<p align="left">It is not our intention to add undue burden or stress on any of our students, and hope that you understand why these changes are necessary. Should you be experiencing any distress, support is available for you from CAPS, College Student Life staff, or Slug Support.</p>

Your instructors and the many staff members who support students and research at UC Santa Cruz have worked incredibly hard to ensure we can continue to carry out our mission. Thank you for your flexibility and patience as we extend the physical boundaries of our academic community during our efforts to keep each other safe.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We recognize that you have many questions and concerns as you head into the spring quarter, and we hope to address many of them below.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tuition and mandatory fees</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Consistent with guidance from the UC Office of the President, all tuition and campus-based fees (excluding housing and dining) will remain unchanged for students enrolled during spring quarter. While the modality of instruction and assessment has changed in many cases, we know that UC instructors and staff will continue to provide high-quality instruction, advising and support services to students while we remain apart. Students will continue to receive full credit for their courses just as they would were we not in a fully remote instructional environment. The emergency transition to remote learning has been costly as we support students, staff, and faculty to work and learn from afar while we continue to maintain significant campus operations.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We also have had multiple inquiries about campus-based, mandatory fees. We understand that this announcement will be disappointing to many, but these fees are almost entirely determined by student referenda, and are not a direct charge for the use of on-campus facilities or services. Many of these fees support the salaries of student-facing staff who will continue to provide non-instructional services to students remotely. Campus fees also provide for the upkeep of crucial facilities that will still require maintenance throughout the coming months. Perhaps most importantly, these fees also support student financial aid and student initiatives that will continue remotely. These fees will not be redirected to any other purpose and will continue to be used to improve the student experience at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Course fees are currently being examined on a course by course basis to determine which are still appropriate and which should be refunded. This work is ongoing and if you have questions about course fees, please contact the office offering the course. Miscellaneous fees are fees for services, and are only charged when the service is used. Units will make refund decisions for payments already received based on whether the service was available and utilized.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>On-campus housing and other services</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Over the past two weeks, the majority of students living on campus have returned to their permanent residences. Refunds of housing and dining charges for these groups are ongoing and may not be immediately reflected on your portal.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Those who remain in on-campus housing are encouraged to continue maintaining physical distance from other residents and to follow the directions of the housing and dining staff. To better serve students and ensure that we can support our region through this public health crisis, housing staff is working to ensure each student has their own room in a staffed building. Please continue to check your UCSC email to receive timely updates on any changes to housing plans.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Financial aid</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Financial Aid and Scholarship Office will continue to support students remotely via email this quarter.

The idea of this working group came from conversations with Graduate Council and acting Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies Quentin Williams. I am pleased to share today the charge and membership for that working group. <br/><br/><strong>Charge:</strong> As part of our campus efforts to develop a strategic, realistic and actionable plan to enhance graduate student welfare and strengthen graduate programs, the Joint Working Group on Support for Graduate Education is charged with assessing the totality of the revenues related to the graduate enterprise and the ways those revenues are currently used. Specifically, this analysis should include:<br/>
<ul>
<li>A revenue analysis of the graduate enterprise relative to the various expenditures on the enterprise focusing on:
<ul>
<li>Current Graduate Division fellowships and block funding allocations and the ways they are used by programs, including for the recruitment of students who enhance the excellence of our research enterprise, contribute to the diversity of our graduate programs, and improve our teaching mission</li>
<li>Number and distribution of teaching assistantships and graduate student instructors, particularly in relationship to the undergraduate and graduate student enrollments of the program</li>
<li>Number and distribution of research assistants and external fellowships (e.g. T32, NSF GRFP, GAANN, philanthropy)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assessment of the short-term impacts of the 5-year funding guarantees for doctoral students (2-year for MFAs) on graduate programs and the institution, and possible strategies for navigating the transition period as programs adapt</li>
<li>Goals and the carrying capacity of Divisions and individual PhD and MFA graduate programs</li>
<li>Potential of alternative funding streams including cross-subsidies from MS/MA programs, including professional, self-supporting and 4+1 programs, and the role of research development and prospective Center- or graduate block grant funding.&#160;</li>
</ul>
In addition, we ask that the working group build on the information and insights gained from this analysis to provide recommendations about near and longer-term ways to stabilize and/or enhance the graduate enterprise across disciplines on campus. Throughout this group&#8217;s work, we ask for explicit consideration of student diversity, broadly defined.<br/><br/>We ask the working group to submit a report by July 1, 2020.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Membership</strong></span><br/>Administration: <br/>Quentin Williams, Vice Provost/Dean Graduate Studies, co-Chair <br/>Scott Brandt, Vice Chancellor, searchResearch<br/>Katharyne Mitchell, Dean of Social Sciences<br/>Jim Moore, Assistant Dean, Graduate Studies <br/>Kimberly Register, Planning &amp; Budget<br/>Alexander Wolf, Dean, Baskin School of Engineering <br/><br/>Senate:<br/>Donald Smith, Microbiology &amp; Environmental Toxicology, Chair, Graduate Council, co-chair <br/>David Brundage, History, Senate Vice Chair<br/>Gina Dent, Feminist Studies, Graduate Council<br/>Debbie Gould, Sociology, Committee on Planning &amp; Budget<br/>Longzhi Lin, Mathematics, Graduate Council<br/>Dard Neuman, Music, Committee on Planning &amp; Budget</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Faculty</audience><admin>Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="55b7712e8072701751192fa60a2583cb"><name>arboretum-burn</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Expect to see smoke near Arboretum, as burn piles planned for Friday</title><summary>Campus work crews are planning to burn vegetation piles in and around the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum on Friday, April 10.&#13;

<p>The university&#8217;s new global and<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5771402/">community health</a><span>&#160;</span>program will offer a multidisciplinary bachelor of arts degree and a bachelor of science degree. The program will also coordinate university-wide community and global health research efforts.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;It's a bit surreal to have a conversation about building a global and community health program in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic,&#8221; said Matthew Sparke, a member of the UCGHI board and of the team developing the new program. Sparke is also a professor of politics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the pandemic certainly shows why these issues of global and community health matter. It has made painfully clear why we need to study the natural science of disease emergence, spread, and impact. And it is also showing why social science on vulnerability, resilience, and how we respond to health challenges globally and locally is critical,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The team developing the program includes faculty and administrators from departments across the biological and social sciences. Faculty from engineering, the arts, and humanities disciplines are also participating.</p>
<p>This diversity, with viewpoints from many departments represented, is a strength that will help ensure the program&#8217;s success, said Grant Hartzog, a professor of molecular, cell, and developmental<span>&#160;</span><em>biology</em><span>&#160;</span>at UC Santa Cruz and a member of the team.</p>
<p>The process &#8220;brought people from multiple departments together and to think more deeply about how the collaboration is going to work and how the program will work. And it gets people talking to one another and working with one another,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an elegant way of beginning to build the relationships that will make it a strong program.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the introduction of new courses and expanded elective offerings, an existing major, Human Biology, will transition into the new BS track of the global and community health program, Hartzog said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we're hoping to do, through our collaboration with our colleagues in the social sciences, is to build a richer set of opportunities for students to not only see the science of medicine, but the human aspects of it, the political aspects of it, the social aspects of it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The university is hiring to fill six new positions for the program. For the four in human biology disciplines, the hiring committee searched for specialists in the microbiome, stem cell biology, structural biology, and parasitic and infectious diseases.</p>
<p>For the two positions on the social sciences side, the list was less specific. &#8220;Anyone who could find a home in any one of our social science departments was a viable candidate,&#8221; Sparke said. With the search in the finalist stage, likely fields include anthropology, sociology, politics, environmental studies, and Latino and Latin American studies, he said.</p>
<p>All students in the program will start and end their studies together through an introductory course called Foundations for Global and Community Health and a capstone course.</p>
<p>The introductory course will be designed to help students determine whether they want to pursue a BA or BS. &#8220;We'll give them an early taste before they really have to decide which academic track they're going to go into,&#8221; Hartzog said.</p>
<p>The introductory course will provide five to six case studies of global health challenges, including a parasitic disease, a bacterial disease, and, as appears to be the case with the novel coronavirus, an example of &#8220;infectious agents jumping species barriers,&#8221; Hartzog said.</p>
<p>The case studies will cover both biological and social science aspects of a disease. An example might be the parasitic disease elephantiasis. According to the<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lymphatic-filariasis">World Health Organization</a>, nearly 900 million people in 49 countries need preventive treatment to stop the disease, which is caused by three types of parasitic worms, from spreading. Students would gain a biological sciences perspective of the disease by learning about the life cycle of the worms, drugs that treat the condition, routes of infection, and how the disease causes limbs to swell dramatically.</p>
<p>Elephantiasis is not a lethal disease, but it is a debilitating and socially isolating one, Hartzog said. People with the condition depend on family members to care for them. Effective treatments exist but are too expensive for the public health budgets in many countries where the disease is common. Treatments must also be administered over a relatively long time.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have poor people who have to travel a long way to get to medical providers, and then they need to take a course of drugs for six to twelve weeks, it's just really not practical to do that,&#8221; Hartzog said. &#8220;Those sorts of social and societal-level problems make solutions that might work in the developed world are not appropriate in many of countries where elephantiasis is common,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>After the introductory course, students in the two tracks will continue with different courses until their senior year. They&#8217;ll then combine their respective learning and training and work in teams on a capstone project that aims to provide solutions to a major challenge in global and community health.</p>
<p>To solve global health problems &#8220;you need the epidemiologists, you need the scientists that can talk about disease biology, but you also need policy studies and people who can study the vulnerabilities of certain groups like the homeless and farmworkers,&#8221; Sparke said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you need to put all that together to work out a coherent response to health challenges. That's what we envision doing: training our students to be able to participate in that kind of real-world work,&#8221; Sparke said.</p>
<p>With its long history in social justice, UC Santa Cruz is a natural home for a global and community health program, Sparke said. The program will appeal to students who feel pressure to find a career that will support them once they graduate but who also want to address injustices and alleviate inequality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think global health is one compelling way to achieve that very challenging balancing act,&#8221; Sparke said.</p>
<p>Though options for students to work with new faculty will begin once the faculty members are hired, the degree programs won&#8217;t start until April of 2022 at the earliest. Hartzog looks forward to the program beginning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we're going to do great things for our students,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I think the extent to which we can show students the possibilities of contributing to public health and to health-care careers, which after all, are 20 percent of our economy, we're going to do good things both for our local community, but more broadly for the country and the world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Thomas J. Coates, UCLA professor of medicine and director of the system-wide University of California Global Health Institute, applauded the new program at UC Santa Cruz as the goal is to provide students at all campuses the opportunity for a global health major or minor. &#8220;UC Santa Cruz brings its unique focus on community health across the globe and will offer students a truly multidisciplinary learning experience to prepare them to address major health problems across the globe.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="56fed99c8072701751192fa699e8c019"><name>on-campus-parking-refunds-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>On-campus parking refunds update</title><summary>As you may have already seen from an earlier communication, parking permit requirements for regular, non-reserved parking spaces on campus, including the Coastal Sciences Campus and the Westside Research Park facility (2300 Delaware), will be temporarily suspended until May 3rd. </summary><start-date>1586242980000</start-date><display-name>On-campus parking refunds update</display-name><path>/2020/04/on-campus-parking-refunds-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/04/on-campus-parking-refunds-update</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1586302474616</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594757465551</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>All,&#160;</span></p>

If you have already returned your permit, you will still be included in the retroactive refunds that date back to March 18th when permit requirements were originally suspended. Please note - additional information regarding renewals and the eventual re-introduction of permit requirements on campus, is forthcoming. We will be in communication with you as soon as it&#8217;s determined how best to proceed.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Your refund distribution will depend on how you paid for your permit. Please see below for your specific situation:</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Staff/Faculty</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Payroll Deductions:</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Because parking is paid in arrears (debits on your payroll check are for the previous pay period&#8217;s parking), and due to system restrictions related to UCPath payroll, your refund will occur as a series of credits and debits reflected on your paycheck.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Biweekly employees will see this beginning on their pay stub dated April 15th and monthly employees will see this beginning on their pay stub dated May 1st.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Examples*:&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Commuter Smith is an employee who has an Annual A permit that costs $75 per month, and they are paid </span><strong>biweekly</strong><span><strong>.</strong> On April 15th, their paycheck will reflect the following:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Credit</strong></span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>:</strong></span> Prorated amount reflecting the number of days parking permits were unnecessary during the penultimate pay period (parking for March 8-21)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Debit</strong></span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>:</strong></span> Regular bi-weekly debit (parking for March 22-April 4)&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The net difference will show on Commuter Smith&#8217;s paystub, reflecting a smaller amount than their regular debit. The following pay period will fall fully within the timeline of the permit requirement suspension, so their debit and credit will cancel each other out and no debit will show on their next pay stub.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Traveler Jones is an employee who has the same type of A permit and they are paid </span><strong>monthly.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>On May 1st, their paycheck will reflect the following:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Credit</strong></span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>:</strong> </span>Prorated amount reflecting the number of days parking was unnecessary during the penultimate pay period (parking for March 1-31)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Debit</strong></span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>:</strong></span> $75 (Parking for April 1-30)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Traveler&#8217;s total will reflect the net difference between both the prorated credit and debit on their pay stub. Should the permit requirement suspension continue into the entirety of May, on June 1st Traveler&#8217;s credit will be for a full month, so the credit and debit will cancel each other out.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>These credits and debits will continue until normal parking permit requirements are reinstated.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>*Please note that credit and debit amounts will vary on an individual basis dependent upon the type of permit you have. The amounts given in the examples are for clarification purposes only.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Prepaid:</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you prepaid for your </span><span>annual</span><span> permit in full via cash or credit card, you will be issued a check representing credits retroactive to March 18th through the permit&#8217;s expiration. Please email </span><a href="mailto:tapssales@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>tapssales@ucsc.edu</span></a><span> to confirm the address where your check(s) should be mailed.&#160;</span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Graduate / Undergraduate Student</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Student Accounts:</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you paid for your permit via your student account, the prorated refund amount will be credited back to your student account. If a partial refund has already been issued, you will receive an additional credit that will cover the time retroactive to March 18th.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Prepaid</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you paid for your permit via cash or credit card, you will be refunded for the balance of your permit retroactive to March 18th. Please email </span><a href="mailto:tapssales@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>tapssales@ucsc.edu</span></a><span> to verify the address where your check should be sent.</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many health care providers, cashiers, farm workers and health aides,&#160; &#8220;safe distance&#8221; is a luxury.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why doctor and educator Catherine Sonquist Forest ( Rachel Carson, community studies and environmental studies, &#8217;81) is on an urgent mission to crowdsource, manufacture, and deliver cloth masks to those who need them the most in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties during the COVID-19 crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An attending physician in outpatient care and clinical associate professor of family medicine at Natividad Medical Center in Salinas, Forest has spent most of her life helping patients and advocating for better protections for health care workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now she is a visionary and partner for</span><a href="https://www.ppe4cc.org/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Project PPE 4 Central Coast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a collaborative partnership with Idea Fab Labs, a Santa Cruz-based </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">community hub that has high-tech fabrication tools including 3D printers and laser cutters for art making and small-scale manufacturing.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forest, who is married to epidemiologist </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will Forest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was ramping up efforts to make and distribute masks for weeks before the Centers For Disease Control called for members of the public to wear a mask &#8220;appropriate to the level of risk&#8221; outside the home in early April.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instigating factor was the legions of doctors, nurses, and EMTs who are vulnerable to infection in their work saving lives. Without proper protections, &#8220;we are endangering three generations of health care workers,&#8221; Forest said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While she called California Gov. Gavin Newsom&#8217;s shelter-at-home order the cornerstone of the state&#8217;s ability to mitigate the fight against COVID-19, Forest expressed concern about area residents who must still venture out, either for work or for essential appointments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is essential to &#8220;maintain your space and cover your face while sheltering in place&#8221; she said.&#160; &#8220;However, I know someone who is immunocompromised and must go out every day for a health appointment. That is not a safe situation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forest is answering the need for masks by channeling a combination of Santa Cruz high-tech know how and the skills of a crafty sewing community. In the process, she is helping to put the fight against the spread of COVID-19 into local hands, she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to take initiative, instead of waiting for a trickle-down approach.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With support from the nonprofit Encompass Community Services, where Forest serves as co-chair of the board of trustees, and in partnership with Santa Cruz and Monterey Medical Societies and the Central Coast Academy of Family Physicians, Project PPE 4 Central Coast has become a cloth-mask production hub. Idea Fab Labs makes cloth-based mask-making kits, which are then distributed to more than 30 quilters and sewists across the Central Coast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forest is looking to grow this hard-working group of independent contractors as much as possible. Donations, channeled through GoFundMe, have been subsidizing the cost of the mask materials and payment to the seamsters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cloth masks are inspired by the design of the N95 mask, a health-industry standard. They consist of four layers of cotton fabric, alternating grain and bias cut fabric, with moldable nose bridges, ensuring a snug fit around the nose and chin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also have stretch headbands, though a national shortage of elastic is posing a challenge. Because they can be washed or heated in ovens, the mask can be sterilized for re-use. The fabric also ensures that the masks can be mass-produced with material kits and DIY assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project PPE 4 Central Coast takes orders from non-profit organizations in need of the masks and is poised to coordinate a larger regional innovation effort. Although the project is not currently selling the masks to the general public, the template for the washable mask design is </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mYrU4wJRfEpEEGB8cxV031PBhWsyz8kp/view"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">available for free download</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, along with</span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11M7ksfqt_asVxY2ketbAnHRGUKRfNtpD/view"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">DIY instructions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8uuzBVe_sk&amp;feature=youtu.be"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">step-by-step video demonstration.</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Forest said that the masks are easy to make for anyone with a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sewing machine</span><strong>.&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forest emphasizes that these masks, while effective in preventing the transmission of droplets from the wearer to other people, are no substitute for genuine N95s &#8211; which also offer the wearer some protection from droplets from others. She emphasized that all certified N95s and surgical masks should be reserved for high risk jobs such as healthcare workers. The group has also innovated face shields, barriers for testing stations, and other PPE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is imperative that hospital personnel have first priority when it comes to N95 distribution, she said. &#8220;These are not N95s, and we are not making that claim,&#8221; Forest said. &#8220;But we are trying to do a better job in creating a mask design than just a bandanna, cloth wrapping, or 2-layer cloth surgical mask.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since plastics and medical materials are scarce these days, cloth masks provide an easily sourced alternative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the sewists</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">finish the masks, project partners collect and distribute them to health care and residential workers, home health aides, and hospice workers, as well as local physicians and their staff who don&#8217;t work for hospitals that are part of large buyer groups that can vie for protective equipment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s an ambitious project. Forest hopes to keep ramping up production until the seamsters are producing 3,000 or more&#160; masks per week. But a national health emergency requires innovation and bold approaches, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back, Forest can trace the roots of Project PPE 4 Central Coast to her college days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I developed a problem-solving ability, as well as my commitment to health equity and justice while at UC Santa Cruz,&#8217;&#8217; Forest said. &#8220;That has been a thread through my whole career. I am grateful for that training. If this project makes even one speck of difference during the COVID-19 epidemic, it will have been worth it.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5f872c988072701751192fa672b07085"><name>isomer-separation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New isomer separation method a boon for research on protein oxidation</title><summary>UCSC chemists have developed an easy way to separate the stereoisomers of an oxidized amino acid that has important functions in protein biology.</summary><keywords>Jevgenij Raskatov</keywords><start-date>1586415600000</start-date><display-name>New isomer separation method a boon for research on protein oxidation</display-name><path>/2020/04/isomer-separation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/04/isomer-separation</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1586445626492</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1586445856326</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/04/images/cover-image-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/04/images/cover-image-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-image-410.jpg</name><display-name>cover-image-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>119309</file-size><width>410</width><height>547</height></image><image-alt>cover image</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/04/images/cover-image-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/04/images/cover-image-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-image-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cover-image-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22641</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>cover image</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>UCSC chemists have developed an easy way to separate the stereoisomers of an oxidized amino acid that has important functions in protein biology</article-subhead><article-text><p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Proteins are made up of long chains of amino acids, and most proteins have one or more of the sulfur-containing amino acid methionine. Oxidation of the sulfur atom in methionine is an important biomolecular reaction that can have a wide range of biological consequences depending on the context and the protein involved. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Interestingly, the sulfur oxidation of methionine can give rise to two different versions of the oxidized molecule (methionine sulfoxide) differing only in the 3-dimensional spatial arrangement of its atoms. The two versions are called stereoisomers (or, more precisely, diastereomers, which are stereoisomers that are not mirror images). Researchers studying the biological effects of sulfur oxidation would like to be able to separate the two stereoisomers, but this has been extremely difficult to do. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Now, chemists at UC Santa Cruz have reported a new method for separation of methionine sulfoxide diastereomers that opens up new opportunities for studying their roles in biological processes. In a paper </span><a href="https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/chem.202000735"><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">published April 6 in </span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Chemistry, A European Journal</i></span></u></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, they reported obtaining both stereoisomers in purities exceeding 99%. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The field of methionine oxidation has been hampered for decades by a lack of robust access to these reagents, and we believe this will be a tremendous boost,&#8221; said first author Jevgenij Raskatov, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Raskatov&#8217;s lab collaborated with researchers at the California Institute of Technology on the paper, which was featured on the cover of the journal. Raskatov said he has already heard from other researchers in the field who are interested in the new method.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Raskatov&#8217;s team used an advanced chromatography technique called supercritical fluid chromatography to purify the methionine sulfoxide stereoisomers. Supercritical fluids have the properties of both liquids and gases, which can be very useful in chromatography.

<p dir="ltr"><span>Cloth face coverings serve to keep each of us from sharing respiratory &#8220;droplets&#8221; with those around us. Given the community spread of COVID-19 throughout Santa Cruz county and the Bay Area, some people may have been infected but will not have symptoms for several days, while others may be carriers of the virus but never show symptoms. Current information indicates that these people can unintentionally infect others around them.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In accordance with the CDC and California Department of Public Health guidance, we strongly encourage the campus community to use face coverings when in public settings, conducting essential work on campus, or entering campus dining facilities or other environments in which it may be difficult to maintain a safe distance of at least 6 feet from other people.&#160;</span></p>

</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>UCSC employees and students are welcome to use their own cloth face coverings. In addition, the campus is coordinating with campus partners to procure reusable cloth face coverings for essential staff working on campus and students living in on-campus housing who are unable to provide their own.&#160;Please note, these will be non-medical grade face coverings. Priority will be given to essential staff working on campus in close quarters and in confined indoor spaces, including dining services, housing staff, and custodial services.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Managers and supervisors should review this information with all essential employees who are physically on site, including those who visit the work site periodically. For employees and tasks that require close contact with others (less than 6 feet), contact EH&amp;S at </span><a href="mailto:ehs@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ehs@ucsc.edu</span></a><span> for a workplace assessment and potential risk minimization support, including protective equipment.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Remember to shelter in place unless leaving home for essential tasks. Use frequent handwashing, maintain at least a 6 foot distance between you and others when engaging in essential activities in public, and wear a face covering to protect each other. Working together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community.&#160;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>It is hard to know how to begin addressing the difficulties we have lived through this year. Numerous disruptions of varying nature have interrupted the learning, research, and work of our campus, to say nothing of cherished traditions and events we look forward to every year. Despite the challenges, we have continually demonstrated our collective resilience and tenacity. We are grateful for our community and we know we will make it through this current upheaval.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>While we all continue to work hard keeping the essential operations of campus moving forward, we can also acknowledge the uncertainty and fear that we all experience when facing the unknown. The Staff Advisory Board members know that folks in our community have questions. The SAB wants to help connect those questions to the folks who can provide answers.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Yesterday, the SAB met with Chancellor Cynthia Larive, and we are pleased to announce that we will host the Chancellor and Senior Leadership Forum in the coming weeks. We hope to have a date set soon. With ITS and other business units' work so disrupted by current events, we are still working on the specifics of date and time.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the meantime, the SAB welcomes staff input on what issues are most important to the community at this time. Please share your thoughts </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLIzXwhKYp18uZY2FghurKUAFci5uVuQZ82xjfmTBp_lRlzg/viewform?usp%3Dsf_link&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1586551164525000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEfGceAFoGCv66tFskYkYVeq9DX8Q" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLIzXwhKYp18uZY2FghurKUAFci5uVuQZ82xjfmTBp_lRlzg/viewform?usp=sf_link" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>on this form</span></a><span>, and the SAB will make sure our senior leadership team sees your feedback.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For this event, we anticipate most of the questions/concerns of staff at this point will be related to human resources. As such, this forum will likely focus on those issues, and we hope to have our Staff Human Resources experts join the chancellor to be able to provide the best information possible. We expect the feedback from staff to be diverse, and if subsequent fora are necessary to address other concerns, the chancellor and SAB are committed to holding additional events.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Keep a lookout for follow up communication that will set a date and time for this event. Thank you for your time and engagement. I remain appreciative of the UCSC community, and the SAB looks forward to hearing from you in the coming days and weeks.&#160;</span></p>

Weissman will use the $50,000 award to support his work on the visualization of prime numbers.</p>
<p>Weissman is one of 175 writers, scholars, artists, and scientists chosen this year from among nearly 3,000 applicants for recognition by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. Guggenheim Fellows are appointed on the basis of prior achievement and exceptional promise.</p>
<p>Weissman's research involves number theory, representation theory, and geometry, and he has a particular interest in design and information visualization. His 2018 book <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/03/number-theory.html"><em>An Illustrated Theory of Numbers</em></a> won acclaim for its novel approach to visualizing concepts in mathematics.</p>
<p>The Guggenheim Fellowship will support a new project, which he plans to begin in 2021, to convey the nature of prime numbers through a series of 60 images. According to Weissman, visualization can allow both experts and non-experts to explore data in new ways, and prime numbers can be thought of as the most important data set in mathematics. The primes are often called the &#8220;building blocks&#8221; of arithmetic.</p>
<p>&#8220;My hope is to visualize the nature of prime numbers, from ancient history to the current research,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to create images that convey not just a mathematical form&#8212;a shape or pattern native to mathematicians&#8212;but which convey a mathematical narrative. I hope to create didactic art that provides a visual mathematical experience.</p>
<p>Weissman said he envisions publishing this work as a book about prime numbers, driven by images and written for a scientifically literate public.</p>
<p>Weissman earned his Ph.D. in mathematics at Harvard University in 2003 and joined the UCSC faculty in 2006.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="65522b788072701751192fa65feb683b"><name>art-torres-alumni-regent</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Art Torres: UC Santa Cruzâ€™s fifth alumni regent </title><summary>Art Torres (Stevenson, â€˜68, government), a former California state senator and former chair of the California Democratic Party, was named the fifth UC Santa Cruz alumnus to represent the campus on the Board of Regents.  &#13;

But he soon learned to love it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The education was bold and experimental, and dissent was in the air. The Doors and Aretha Franklin boomed from his dorm room hi-fi. UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s woodsy setting required some adjustment for this city kid from East L.A., who transferred to the campus from an urban community college at the urging of his dean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were not an outdoorsy kind of family,&#8217;&#8217; Torres said, laughing.&#160; &#8220;My dad was a working-class butcher all his life. We lived and breathed the city. The first time I ever saw a deer cross my path was at UC Santa Cruz on the way to the library!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After an initial rocky adjustment to his rigorous and intimate courses &#8211; &#8220;the classes were so small; you couldn&#8217;t hide, like you could in a large lecture course&#8221; &#8211; Torres discovered &#8220;a very magical place.&#8221; He&#160; immersed himself in politics and social activism, served as Stevenson College&#8217;s student president, and recruited some living legends to speak or perform on campus, including Alfred Hitchcock, sitar master Ravi Shankar, and the rock band Jefferson Airplane.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, more than 50 years later, Torres is speaking up for the campus in a new, high profile way. This month, Torres, a former California state senator and former chair of the California Democratic Party, was named the fifth UC Santa Cruz alumnus to serve as an Alumni Regent.&#160;Torres s<span>erved as a UC Santa Cruz Foundation Trustee from 2014-2018.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At any given time, the Board of Regents has two alumni regents, and two alumni regent designates. UC Santa Cruz gets to appoint an alumni regent every eight years. The most recent appointment was Ken Feingold, who served from 2012-2014.&#160;</span>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>An important voice at a critical time&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz Alumni Council (the 25-member Board of Directors of the UC Santa Cruz Alumni Association) chose Torres, who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area.&#160; The Alumni Council received eleven applicants for the position, all of them highly qualified and experienced members of the UC Santa Cruz alumni community, said Michael Riepe, </span><a href="https://alumni.ucsc.edu/about/council/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Alumni Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Torres&#8217;s role as alumni regent will give UC Santa Cruz an important voice at the table during a critical time for University of California, Riepe said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are confident that Art will serve with wisdom as a close partner and friend to UC Santa Cruz, that he will work with us to create more outreach to UC alumni, and that he will provide a steady hand as the University of California faces unprecedented challenges over the next two years,&#8221; Riepe said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riepe also called Torres &#8220;a wonderful role model for recent graduates. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Art </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exemplifies how a UC education can lead to social mobility and a more level playing field,&#8221; Riepe said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a time when an accessible and affordable UC education faces constant threats, Torres has a long</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> track record of advocacy for students from under-served communities, Riepe said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also mentioned Torres&#8217;s unique preparation for a newer and more unexpected threat. &#8220;Art is laser focused on the looming budget crisis that will be precipitated by COVID-19,&#8221; Riepe said. &#8220;His experience and political connections will be invaluable as the regents and the rest of the UC system navigate this unprecedented crisis.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive called Torres &#8220;an outstanding choice for alumni regent. I am so proud he will represent UC Santa Cruz in this important role.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She pointed to his four decades of experience as a public servant. &#8220;He distinguished himself with his strong commitment to the sciences, his defense of the environment, and his understanding of complex public policy issues,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Art also recognizes the importance of a UC education as a vehicle for social mobility, especially for first-generation and low-income students from diverse backgrounds,&#8221; Larive continued. &#8220;His commitment to social justice and human rights speaks to the core values of UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>A career of distinction&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Torres, the first in his family to graduate from a four-year university, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">leveraged his UC Santa Cruz education to lead a rich, varied, and successful career devoted to public service.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating from UC Santa Cruz and earning his J.D. from UC Davis, Torres went on to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">work with Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta as the legislative director of United Farm Workers (UFW).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Torres served as a John F. Kennedy Teaching Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School before being elected to the California State Legislature. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He served in the California State Assembly from 1974 to 1982 and in the California State Senate from 1982 to 1994.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has written bipartisan legislation in the fields of health care, education, the environment and human rights. He served for twelve years on the Senate Education Committee, as well as the Senate Select Committee on UC Admission.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Torres is now vice chair of the governing board of the California Institute For Regenerative Medicine, a public agency charged with distributing $3 billion in funding for stem cell research authorized by Proposition 71 in 2004. UC Santa Cruz received $26 million to build stem cell labs and help establish the Genomics Institute with help from Torres and the governing board.</span></p>
<p>&#160;<strong>A new chapter&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Michael Riepe called Torres to give him the good news.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was just very honored and happy because it&#8217;s a new challenge,&#8221; Torres said. &#8220;I look forward to working with Chancellor Larive. She is an accomplished scientist and professor who is the perfect leader for UCSC in these coming days.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His appointment comes at a critical time for the future of the University of California and its students, Torres said. &#8220;The decisions made during the remainder of this year will be so important for the future.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Torres said he will work closely with alumni to make sure he has a strong sense of their priorities.While each regent must represent the entire UC system, and not just one campus, alumni regents bring fresh perspectives to the board. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also mentioned the various ways that the University of California has been confronting the COVID-19 crisis, from the work of its research labs to the dramatic shift towards online teaching during a time of safe distancing and a statewide order to shelter at home. All these adjustments are forcing UC to be flexible and expand its teaching mission, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><strong>&#160;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is no question we are facing a very serious question,&#8221; Torres said. &#8220;What will the University of California look like going into 2021?&#8221;</span></p>

We are writing to further clarify UC policy and expectations with respect to pay for researchers during the temporary cessation of non-essential on-campus research due to COVID-19. In VCR Brandt&#8217;s <a href="https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/covid-19/funding-researchers-during-the-cessation20200326.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">March 26 memo</a>, he discussed some principles and made recommendations. This memo supersedes that one and formalizes those principles into official UCSC policy. <br/><br/><em>Our overriding concern is to ensure that all members of our research community continue to receive paychecks during the COVID-19-induced cessation of on-campus activity and return to full productivity once we are able to return to campus.</em><br/><br/>We recognize&#8212;and the entire US research enterprise, from agency heads on down, recognizes&#8212;that this will be a period of reduced research productivity. UC is in active discussions with our state and federal government representatives and agency heads about how to mitigate that impact. Agencies have already signaled that they will extend great latitude regarding deadlines and deliverables and we have hopes for supplemental funding to cover this period. We do not have all the answers now and we will continue to press on this moving forward. Today, our concern is the well-being of our researchers and the continued viability of UCSC&#8217;s outstanding research enterprise.<br/><br/><strong>Paid Administrative Leave:</strong> On March 16, UC President Janet Napolitano announced by Executive Order that all employees will be eligible for up to 128 hours of <a href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2020/01/executive-order-re-paid-administrative-leave-03-16-20.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">paid administrative leave</a> for absences due to various COVID-19-related reasons. By UC policy, this leave is available to all employees, regardless of funding source. Like other types of paid leave&#8212;vacation, sick leave, etc.&#8212;this is now UC policy and thus payable from all extramural funding sources. All employees taking such leave, including extramurally-funded researchers, will continue to be paid on their existing funding source(s).<br/><br/><strong>No-Layoff Policy:</strong> On April 2, UC President Napolitano and the Chancellors sent out <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/letter-uc-president-janet-napolitano-and-10-uc-chancellors-uc-community" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a letter promising no COVID-19-related layoffs</a> through the end of the fiscal year. This policy was further clarified in an April 4 memo providing <a href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2020/04/faq-about-june-30-job-protections.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAQs about UC job protections through June 30</a>. That guarantee applies to all &#8220;current academic and career staff employees.&#8221; Career staff employees are defined as those &#8220;working a fixed or variable percentage of time at 50 percent or more of full-time, and the position is expected to continue for a year or more.&#8221; This policy also applies to undergraduate researchers, GSRs, postdocs, and all academic researchers regardless of percent time or duration of appointment. Per the FAQs, this policy explicitly guarantees that grant-funded researchers will continue to be paid (from their grants) at least through June 30. This policy does not apply to researchers whose positions were set to end on or before June 30 for reasons unrelated to COVID-19.<br/><br/><strong>Accordingly,</strong> except in circumstances described above, all UCSC researchers and research support staff&#8212;core-funded, grant-funded, and recharge-funded&#8212;shall continue to be paid on their existing funding sources (whether they take their allocated administrative leave or not) and shall not be laid off during the current fiscal year ending June 30.<br/><br/>Beyond these minimum guarantees, PIs supporting researchers and students are expected to continue funding them as planned throughout the on-campus research cessation. PIs funding researchers on grants have great freedom to determine what activities will be performed with the funds in pursuit of the research and as discussed above, funding agencies have indicated that they will give grantees wide latitude with respect to deadlines and deliverables in recognition of the severe impact that COVID-19 is having on many researchers&#8217; abilities to perform their research and meet agency deadlines. PIs are directed to find productive activities for their researchers to perform while they are unable to get into their lab. <br/><br/>We have heard concerns that some PIs might lay off their researchers rather than pay them to do research outside of their planned activities. While we respect every PI&#8217;s right to conduct their research as they think best, except in special cases as outlined above, such a response is prohibited before June 30 and, in the unfortunate event that this situation extends beyond June, strongly discouraged beyond that. As discussed in the <a href="https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/covid-19/funding-researchers-during-the-cessation20200326.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">March 26 memo</a>, there are many non-lab research activities that people can productively work on. Be creative and make this work for the good of our entire research community.<br/><br/><strong>Recharge-funded researchers:</strong> Recharge-funded researchers and research support staff are in a unique position in that their funding depends upon providing service to, and charging, researchers for their services. While the employees may be able to perform relevant tasks while locked out of their labs, recharge centers do not generate funds while the labs they support are idle. Therefore, until further notice, all recharge centers are directed to continue paying their employees as outlined above. We will determine later how to cover any deficits they incur.<br/><br/>Any recharge-funded employees who are receiving pay while not working for their recharge center may be assigned other tasks as determined by the Office of Research and/or their divisional leadership, or they may be granted paid administrative leave if applicable.<br/><br/><strong>Contracts:</strong> Any PI who is working on a contract and is concerned about their ability to meet their deliverables should reach out to OSP so that we can contact the sponsor and discuss the terms. We fully expect them to be willing to make accommodations for the circumstances.<br/><br/>As before, please refer to the <a href="https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/covid-19/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Research Continuity with COVID-19 webpage</a> for additional guidance and/or email any comments or questions to <a href="mailto:researchcontinuity@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">researchcontinuity@ucsc.edu</a>.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC PIs, researchers, and research support staff</audience><admin>Lori Kletzer, interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor, Scott Brandt, Vice Chancellor for Research,  Grace McClintock, Assistant Vice Provost for Academic Personnel</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="664767f58072701751192fa6479bf8af"><name>humanities-dean-candidate-visits</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Humanities Dean candidate visits</title><summary>I am happy to announce that starting April 13, four finalists for the Dean of Humanities position will be virtually visiting our campus.  </summary><start-date>1586545500000</start-date><display-name>Humanities Dean candidate visits</display-name><path>/2020/04/humanities-dean-candidate-visits</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/04/humanities-dean-candidate-visits</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1586558887898</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1586558887898</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span>I am happy to announce that starting April 13, four finalists for the Dean of Humanities position will be virtually visiting our campus.&#160; Candidates will be meeting with faculty, staff, and students in the Humanities division and with senior leadership and various constituents from the Chancellor&#8217;s and CP/EVC&#8217;s offices over the course of two days.</span><br/><br/><span>During their virtual visit, each candidate will be giving two public talks, a Scholarly Research talk and a Town Hall talk.

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">How was it formed, and where did it come from? A new study </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1065-8"><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">published </span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>April 13</span></span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> in </span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Nature Astronomy</i></span></u></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> offers a first comprehensive answer to these questions. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">First author Yun Zhang at the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and coauthor Douglas N. C. Lin at UC Santa Cruz, used computer simulations to show how objects like &#8216;Oumuamua can form under the influence of tidal forces like those felt by Earth&#8217;s oceans. Their formation theory explains all of &#8216;Oumuamua&#8217;s unusual characteristics.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">We showed that &#8216;Oumuamua-like interstellar objects can be produced through extensive tidal fragmentation during close encounters of their parent bodies with their host stars, and then ejected into interstellar space,&#8221; said Lin, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Mysterious object</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Discovered on October 19, 2017, by the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1 (Pan-STARRS1) in Hawaii, &#8216;Oumuamua is absolutely nothing like anything else in our solar system, according to Zhang. Its dry surface, unusually elongated shape, and puzzling motion even drove some scientists to wonder if it was an alien probe.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">It is really a mysterious object, but some signs, like its colors and the absence of radio emission, point to &#8216;Oumuamua being a natural object,&#8221; Zhang said.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Our objective is to come up with a comprehensive scenario, based on well understood physical principles, to piece together all the tantalizing clues,&#8221; Lin said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Astronomers had expected that the first interstellar object they detected would be an icy body like a comet. Icy objects like those populating the Oort cloud, a reservoir of comets in the outermost reaches of our solar system, evolve at very large distances from their host stars, are rich in volatiles, and are often tossed out of their host systems by gravitational interactions. They are also highly visible due to the sublimation of volatile compounds, which creates a comet&#8217;s coma (or &#8220;tail&#8221;) when it is warmed by the sun. &#8216;Oumuamua&#8217;s dry appearance, however, is similar to rocky bodies like the solar system&#8217;s asteroids, indicating a different ejection scenario.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Other researchers have calculated that there must be an extremely large population of interstellar objects like &#8216;Oumuamua. &#8220;The discovery of &#8216;Oumuamua implies that the population of rocky interstellar objects is much larger than we previously thought,&#8221; Zhang said. &#8220;On average, each planetary system should eject in total about a hundred trillion objects like &#8216;Oumuamua. We need to construct a very common scenario to produce this kind of object.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">When a smaller body passes very close to a much bigger one, tidal forces of the larger body can tear the smaller one apart, as happened to comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 when it came close to Jupiter. The tidal disruption processes can eject some debris into interstellar space, which has been suggested as a possible origin for &#8216;Oumuamua. But whether such a process could explain &#8216;Oumuamua&#8217;s puzzling characteristics remained highly uncertain.</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Computer simulations</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Zhang and Lin ran high-resolution computer simulations to model the structural dynamics of an object flying close by a star. They found that if the object comes close enough to the star, the star can tear it into extremely elongated fragments that are then ejected into the interstellar space.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The elongated shape is more compelling when we considered the variation of material strength during the stellar encounter. The ratio of long axis to short axis can be even larger than ten to one,&#8221; Zhang said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The researchers&#8217; thermal modeling showed that the surface of fragments resulting from the disruption of the initial body would melt at a very short distance from the star and recondense at greater distances, thereby forming a cohesive crust that would ensure the structural stability of the elongated shape.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Heat diffusion during the stellar tidal disruption process also consumes large amounts of volatiles, which not only explains &#8216;Oumuamua&#8217;s surface colors and the absence of visible coma, but also elucidates the inferred dryness of the interstellar population,&#8221; Zhang said. &#8220;Nevertheless, some high-sublimation-temperature volatiles buried under the surface, like water ice, can remain in a condensed form.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Observations of &#8216;Oumuamua showed no cometary activity, and only water ice is a possible outgassing source to account for its non-gravitational motion. If &#8216;Oumuamua was produced and ejected by the scenario of Zhang and Lin, plenty of residual water ice could be activated during its passage through the solar system. The resulting outgassing would cause accelerations that match &#8216;Oumuamua&#8217;s comet-like trajectory.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The tidal fragmentation scenario not only provides a way to form one single &#8216;Oumuamua, but also accounts for the vast population of asteroid-like interstellar objects,&#8221; Zhang said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The researchers&#8217; calculations demonstrate the efficiency of tidal forces in producing this kind of object. Possible progenitors, including long-period comets, debris disks, and even super-Earths, could be transformed into &#8216;Oumuamua-size pieces during stellar encounters. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">This work supports estimates of a large population of &#8216;Oumuamua-like interstellar objects. Since these objects may pass through the domains of habitable zones, the possibility that they could transport matter capable of generating life (called panspermia) cannot be ruled out. &#8220;This is a very new field. These interstellar objects could provide critical clues about how planetary systems form and evolve,&#8221; Zhang said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">According to Lin, &#8220;&#8216;Oumuamua is just the tip of the iceberg. We</span><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> anticipate many more interstellar visitors with similar traits will be discovered by future observation with the forthcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">U.S. Naval Academy astronomer Matthew Knight, who is co-leader of the &#8216;Oumuamua International Space Science Institute team and was not involved in the new study, said this work &#8220;does a remarkable job of explaining a variety of unusual properties of &#8216;Oumuamua with a single, coherent model.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">As future interstellar objects are discovered in coming years, it will be very interesting to see if any exhibit &#8216;Oumuamua-like properties. If so, it may indicate that the processes described in this study are widespread,&#8221; Knight said.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="665baa528072701751192fa6b5a366a4"><name>broadcasting-opportunity</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Broadcasting opportunity</title><summary>Alumnus Rizal Aliga takes the KZSC model to his high school alma mater, establishing a student-run broadcasting club that builds school spirit while providing students with career and communications skills.</summary><start-date>1586502000000</start-date><display-name>Broadcasting opportunity</display-name><path>/2020/04/broadcasting-opportunity</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/04/broadcasting-opportunity</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1586560215606</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1587074426611</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Digital Arts and New Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/04/images/rizal-aliga.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/04/images/rizal-aliga.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rizal-aliga.jpg</name><display-name>rizal-aliga.jpg</display-name><file-size>23298</file-size><width>324</width><height>324</height></image><image-alt>Rizal Aliga</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/04/images/rizal-aliga-thumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/04/images/rizal-aliga-thumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rizal-aliga-thumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>rizal-aliga-thumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>2603</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Rizal Aliga</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Rizal Aliga (Cowell &#8217;19, legal studies with an education minor)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Alumnus Rizal Aliga takes the KZSC model to his high school alma mater, establishing a student-run broadcasting club that builds school spirit while providing students with career and communications skills</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rizal Aliga was playing a game of pickup basketball at UC Santa Cruz when Loukas Stelyn-Lawson, then hip-hop director at the campus&#8217;s 20,000-watt radio station, KZSC 88.1 FM, walked up.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re that guy from Vallejo,&#8221; Aliga remembered Stelyn-Lawson saying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vallejo is a North Bay city of 120,000 that is racially diverse but economically challenged, and is viewed by many as the unofficial hip-hop capital of California. It had produced artists from the late Mac Dre to SOB x RBE, whose break-out hit from the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Panther</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> soundtrack went international. Grammy Award&#8211;winning R&amp;B artist H.E.R. is also from Vallejo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aliga, who&#8217;d indicated an interest in joining KZSC during a campus summer academy for incoming students, told Stelyn-Lawson he was, indeed, &#8220;that guy.&#8221; Within months, Aliga was part of the iconic KZSC radio crew being mentored by Stelyn-Lawson and Keith Rozendal, the station&#8217;s advisor and chief operating officer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Stelyn-Lawson graduated, Aliga took up as host of Stelyn-Lawson&#8217;s &#8220;Got Rapps&#8221; show and also began livestreaming and doing play-by-play announcing for campus sports like basketball and volleyball and also deejaying. In addition, he hosted the station&#8217;s first student-run Island Reggae show and produced or contributed to 214 blogs and artist interviews.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Aliga (Cowell &#8217;19, legal studies with an education minor) has taken the same model to Jesse Bethel High School in Vallejo where he graduated in 2016. There, he&#8217;s established a student-run broadcasting club modeled on KZSC that&#8212;until it was sidelined by the Covid-19 pandemic&#8212;had begun livestreaming school sports games and highlighting the campus and students&#8217; accomplishments through interviews and reporting on Instagram.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t for him and the radio station, I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;d be right now,&#8221; said 17-year-old Jesse Bethel senior Giovanni Miles, who hopes to go to film school after graduation. &#8220;Before that, I was just going to school and going home. I wasn&#8217;t interested in things. Once I got involved in the radio station I decided to do more with my life after school.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask Aliga about the high school broadcast club, KJBJ, and he talks with the kind of enthusiasm reserved for a sportscaster at a home game. He started the club right after he was hired as a long-term substitute teacher following his graduation from UC Santa Cruz. There are about 50 students in the lunchtime and after-school club&#8212;20 of them hardcore, he said&#8212;who are not only learning technical and broadcasting skills but also things like FCC rules, journalistic ethics, and ways to conduct a good interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For instance, you have to have a higher vocabulary,&#8221; said Jesse Bethel senior Safa Haywood, 17. &#8220;You can&#8217;t use the same word constantly (in a broadcast). It gave me a reason to start reading more and looking words up in the dictionary (to do play-by-play). I also had to learn the rules of each sport. I did a lot of that. You have to learn a lot of things.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Aliga, the broadcasting club is a way to not only connect students to their school and break down the wall of distrust that he said sometimes exists between students and their teachers or administrators, but also inspire them to build careers and hone the skills needed to communicate with others.&#160; He hopes the club will not only help students become a more active part of their school but also that it becomes self-sustaining, even after he is gone.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think he (Aliga) is a really positive role model and one of our biggest cheerleaders for the school,&#8221; said Ann Talamantes-Ristow, activities director for Jesse Bethel High. &#8220;He decided to come back and do something to really make an impact on our student population and he has definitely done that. Kids like him. They really do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aliga, whose mother is a Vallejo City Council member and his dad a 33-year military veteran, said he&#8217;d eventually like to come back to UC Santa Cruz to pursue a master's degree but, for now, he&#8217;s happy to be able to spread the KZSC vibe of non-commercial broadcasting and inclusivity beyond the boundaries of Santa Cruz.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="666b0e098072701751192fa6ddaa7bb2"><name>commencement-updates</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Commencement updates</title><summary>Commencement is one of the best events of the year and recognizes the incredible accomplishments of our students as well as the communities that support our studentsâ€™ success including staff and faculty members, families and friends.

<p dir="ltr"><span>Commencement is one of the best events of the year and recognizes the incredible accomplishments of our students as well as the communities that support our students&#8217; success including staff and faculty members, families and friends. Because our campus will continue remote instruction through summer, we will not be able to come together as we traditionally do in June for in-person celebrations. Like you, I am disappointed, especially because commencement on our campus is not just about degree conferral &#8211; there are many departmental, divisional, and community-based celebrations that mark this special time and will need to be put on hold in the interest of public health.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We have developed a survey for students nearing graduation to collect their feedback on how they would like to celebrate. The survey also asks students to rank the most important characteristics of an alternative ceremony given the facility limitations on our campus.

Our thoughts are with this employee and their family. We wish them a quick recovery.</p>
<p>Because the campus shuttle program is a public facing activity that provides services for students, faculty, and staff, we believe there is a need to inform our community about this case. The employee drove the loop route on April 1 and 2 and has not been on campus since then. Transit records indicate that approximately 19 people rode the driver&#8217;s bus route over the course of the two days; identities of the passengers are unknown.</p>
<p>We believe this case presents a low risk of exposure to our campus community based on the protocols we instituted on March 17, 2020 to slow the spread of COVID-19: campus shuttle passengers use only the rear entrance of a bus to enter and exit the bus; passengers are separated by at least six feet from the bus driver; and buses are cleaned several times throughout the day by TAPS staff.</p>
<p>In accordance with guidance provided by the Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency, exposed individuals may already have symptoms or may develop symptoms through April 16, 2020. Students who rode the shuttle on April 1 or 2, and have any symptoms or concerns, can call Student Health Services at 831-459-2591 to schedule a telephone visit for risk assessment and possible testing for COVID-19. Faculty or staff who rode the shuttle and have symptoms or concerns should contact their healthcare provider and inform them of any possible exposure and/or symptoms to determine appropriate next steps.</p>
<p>The health and well-being of our campus community is our top priority. Remember to stay home as much as possible, maintain physical distancing of at least six feet from others, and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">wear a face covering</a> in public. Also, frequent hand washing with soap and water remains an effective tool in minimizing COVID-19 exposure from surfaces. Notification about additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 within our campus community will be based on guidance from public health officials.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 situation is dynamic, which means guidance from public health officials and the CDC changes frequently.

<p>Over the weekend, student organizers held a virtual panel for more than 120 newly admitted high school students of color. The panel was held in place of Student Initiated Outreach Yield Weekend (SIO Yield Weekend), which traditionally consists of a weekend long stay on campus for roughly 75 newly admitted students.</p>
<p>Student organizers of SIO Weekend had to cancel their in-person event in February when COVID-19 began impacting campus. But instead of pulling the plug altogether, organizers opted to serve their respective communities in a different way through a Student Initiated Outreach Yield Panel.</p>
<p>UCSC student Ysabelle Habon, one of the panel&#8217;s coordinators, said the goal of this year&#8217;s event was still &#8220;to provide newly admitted students of color, our unique perspectives of higher education, advice about college and connect with current UCSC students.&#8221;</p>
<p>The SIO Yield Program has hosted 12,400 high school students since its inception in 2003. Roughly 60.4 percent of students who attend the SIO program choose to enroll at UCSC. This year&#8217;s high school cohort was mostly from California and included several out-of-state participants.</p>
<p>The SIO Yield Program is made up of three different programs including Oportunidades Rumbo A La Educaci&#243;n (ORALE), Destination Higher Education (DHE), and A Step Forward (ASF). Organized collectively, the event was coordinated by UCSC student leaders from Black Student Union (BSU), Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztlan (MEChA de UCSC), Bayanihan, e2 engaging education, and the Asian Pacific Islander Student Alliance (APISA).</p>
<p>Diego Reza, a student coordinator for the panel, said that access to Zoom technology allowed the program to achieve success in a new way.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were able to reach more students from different areas, which we could not have done through the in-person program,&#8221; Reza said. &#8220;As students from the university, we understand the reality and experience of what it is like to be a person of color on this campus. In our programs, we aim to have workshops that will provide our communities with the tools to engage and succeed in higher education.&#8221;</p>
<p>The student-led online panel was especially timely this year as many campus visits have been cancelled due to the county&#8217;s shelter-in-place ordinance. This quarter, hundreds of student organizations are being challenged to shift their events and operations online in order to serve their incoming campus communities.</p>
<p>Ysabelle Habon, a student organizer at UCSC who helped adapt this year&#8217;s SIO program, said the organization had spent several months planning the original event before transforming it into an online visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to prioritize the health and safety of our communities, increase accessibility of the event and still provide students with the valuable resources and perspectives of current students through Zoom,&#8221; Habon said. &#8220;As a team and as individuals, we are determined and passionate about increasing accessibility of higher education to students of color.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the beginning of April, UCSC Information Technology Services gave all UCSC students access to Zoom Pro which allows users to host unlimited meetings. Student organizers see the technology as a chance to maintain their organizations and deliver services for the greater good.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SIO panel has more meaning in these times since everything is currently changing and becoming more stressful and confusing,&#8221; Reza said, &#8220;Since the students are not able to visit the university or ask their questions in person, there are many students who are at a disadvantage because of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>SOMeCA, which includes Student Media, SOAR, and Cultural Arts &amp; Diversity, advises all student-registered organizations on campus, including the organizations that coordinate the SIO Program.</p>
<p>SOMeCA advisors held workshops to prepare student organizers for holding large events online. In one workshop called &#8220;How to Organize Online,&#8221; student leaders met with UCSC alumna Tiffany Dena Loftin, the director of the NAACP&#8217;s youth and college division to help prepare them for managing their organizations and holding events through Zoom. Student coordinators also received Zoom tutorials from SOMeCA advisors on how to secure online events to prevent problems like Zoom bombing.</p>
<p>New technology and new innovative models for learning have made opportunities for civic engagement, like the SIO Program, possible. In producing this online panel, student-led organizations practiced an alternative model of learning known as the Student Agency Model, which gives UCSC students opportunities to hold leadership positions and manage their own events. The model is the core of many student extracurricular programs at UCSC that are advised by SOMeCA.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, SOMeCA has shown me the ability to organize and problem-solve in a way that is effective and practical,&#8221; said Reza. &#8220;I feel like my own confidence has grown through student organizing and has made me see the importance of these spaces.&#8221;</p>
<p>By coordinating programs like the SIO panel, current students are engaged by holding leadership positions and also giving back to their communities. The model also allows students to build their cultural fluency, critical thinking skills, collaboration skills, self-understanding and apply those skills by taking action, through long-term direct involvement in their organizations. Reza said this unique opportunity to hold the SIO Yield Panel in quarantine boosted his online organizing skills.</p>
<p>Reza said, &#8220;A skill I learned was adapting to new changes and being open to them.&#8221; <br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7940d1a78072701751192fa6910cc8a6"><name>telus-nasa-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Planetary scientist Myriam Telus wins NASA Early Career Award</title><summary>Myriam Telus, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences, has received funding from NASA through the Planetary Science Early Career Award program to support her research in cosmochemistry, the chemical analysis of extraterrestrial materials.</summary><start-date>1586847600000</start-date><display-name>Planetary scientist Myriam Telus wins NASA Early Career Award</display-name><path>/2020/04/telus-nasa-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/04/telus-nasa-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1586877223310</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1586877495506</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/04/images/myriam-telus-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/04/images/myriam-telus-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>myriam-telus-375.jpg</name><display-name>myriam-telus-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>114344</file-size><width>375</width><height>465</height></image><image-alt>Myriam Telus</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/04/images/myriam-telus-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/04/images/myriam-telus-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>myriam-telus-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>myriam-telus-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26432</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Myriam Telus</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Myriam Telus</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Myriam Telus, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, has received funding from NASA through the Planetary Science Early Career Award program to support her research in cosmochemistry, the chemical analysis of extraterrestrial materials.<br/><br/>Telus is one of six early-career scientists chosen for funding through the program, which aims to advance the research and professional development of exceptional early-career scientists. The awards of up to $200,000 to each of the selected investigators will allow the recipients to continue their work and meaningfully contribute to the planetary science community.<br/><br/>Telus&#8217;s research focuses on understanding the timing and conditions of the formation and early evolution of the solar system. Through detailed and precise analyses of meteorites&#8212;pieces of asteroids that have fallen to Earth&#8212;she finds clues to the formation and evolution of planetesimals, the building blocks of planets.<br/><br/>At UC Santa Cruz, Telus has directed the development of cosmochemistry and scanning electron microscope (SEM) labs in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. She is also repurposing a room in the cosmochemistry lab to be a clean and protected area for storing meteorite samples. This area will also be suitable for storing samples returned from NASA&#8217;s OSIRIS-Rex mission and the Japanese Hayabusa 2 mission, which aim to collect samples from the asteroids Bennu and Ryugu, respectively.<br/><br/>Telus has studied the isotopic composition of carbonate minerals in a class of meteorites called carbonaceous chondrites, and she hopes to carry out similar analyses for returned samples from Bennu and Ryugu.<br/><br/>She also has an ongoing project to analyze iron and nickel isotopes in pristine chondrites, which can yield clues to the conditions and timing of the solar system&#8217;s formation by constraining the initial abundance of iron-60, an iron isotope with a half-life of 2.6 million years.<br/><br/>In addition, as part of an interdisciplinary collaboration, Telus is working on meteorite outgassing analyses to place constraints on the initial composition of planetary atmospheres.<br/><br/>&#8220;Meteorites are the only samples available to directly test how the initial ingredients that went into making a planet influence the composition of the atmosphere,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have a unique research collaboration that brings together expertise from astronomy, planetary science, and material science to develop experimental techniques aimed to facilitate interpretation of exoplanet observations.&#8221;<br/><br/>Telus earned her B.S. in geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago and her Ph.D. in geology and geophysics at the University of Hawaii, Manoa. She joined the UCSC faculty in 2017.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7a5b012a8072701751192fa61876c482"><name>sad-news-about-our-campus-employee</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sad news about our campus employee</title><summary>It is with a heavy heart that I share the news that the campus shuttle driver who we had reported had tested positive for COVID-19 died earlier today of complications related to the virus at a local hospital. </summary><start-date>1586847600000</start-date><display-name>Sad news about our campus employee</display-name><path>/2020/04/sad-news-about-our-campus-employee</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/04/sad-news-about-our-campus-employee</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1586895716622</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594743010147</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><span>It is with a heavy heart that I share the news that the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/04/transit-driver-covid-case.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1586980526759000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE5aN4Uj6G9Z4n5Qucs_jVLDiX7iw" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/04/transit-driver-covid-case.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>campus shuttle driver who we had reported had tested positive for COVID-19</span></a><span> died earlier today of complications related to the virus at a local hospital.

This includes any attempt to gather on April 20, as in recent years, for the unsanctioned "4-20." Such gatherings place our community, on and off campus, and our police officers and first responders at risk of contracting the virus causing the COVID-19 disease. This is particularly dangerous because some individuals who contract the virus are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, which means they may not be aware they carry the virus and are transmitting it to others.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Pursuant to the PHO, signs were posted on campus and areas were taped-off prohibiting access to UC Santa Cruz trails, recreational areas, etc. Unfortunately, we have since found that signs are missing, vandalized, and that some of the cordoned-off areas have had the tape removed. We continue to educate and warn individuals about prohibited activities.&#160;&#160;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Violation of the PHO is a misdemeanor punishable by citation or arrest, with fines of $1,000 possible.

It has also posed challenges and altered the work priorities of some staff members. This in turn has impacts on many of the annual goals that were identified by staff members at the outset of this year&#8217;s performance review cycle. Our campus recently announced the launch of the new ePerformance module of UC Path. We outlined training sessions and announced a due date of July 31, 2020 for non-represented staff appraisals, with a due date of Aug. 31, 2020 for represented staff appraisals.</span><br/><br/><span>President Janet Napolitano has asked campuses to delay performance appraisals for staff until fall. She has also asked that decisions about staff merit-based salary increases that have been tied to performance appraisals be delayed until the campus financial picture is clearer. As a result, the previously communicated dates for the performance appraisal cycle have been halted. Though we do not yet know when the completion and submission of the performance appraisals will take place, we will proceed with the training program outlined for supervisors to learn about the new ePerformance module. This will ensure we are prepared to act quickly when we are given the go-ahead to proceed with appraisals.</span><br/><br/><span>We encourage managers and supervisors to continue providing regular support and feedback to employees as part of their leadership practice. To advance this, managers and supervisors are encouraged to:</span><br/>
<ul>
<li>Continue to hold and document performance and goal-oriented discussions via Zoom, telephone and email. Purposeful communications about ever-changing goals and objectives are especially important during this crisis. I know many--if not most--staff have successfully shifted to remote work if possible and we certainly want managers to acknowledge these successes and continue to set appropriate goals as we navigate through this crisis.</li>
<li>Build a culture of engagement that includes reinforcing the importance of ongoing candid supervisor/supervisee relationships. While this crisis has been disruptive to the traditional face-to-face format we usually use to have these discussions, let&#8217;s take advantage of the available technology and use the time we formerly devoted to those candid conversations to still have the dialog through Zoom and other formats.</li>
<li>Acknowledge that there is a lot we still do not know. The merit pay will be delayed but we do not know for how long and what the impact will be.</li>
</ul>
<span>I am very proud of the dedication to our mission I witness everyday by our campus community. When we eventually emerge on the other side of this crisis we will want to reflect back and see what worked well and what we can learn from our experience.&#160;</span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Staff</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="843a985e8072701751192fa63082d60c"><name>community-conversations-resilience</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community Conversations: Resilience </title><summary>Many of us find ourselves challenged with remote work, at a time when we may be dealing with personal matters or professional upheaval.

<p>&#8220;The election of UC Santa Cruz to the APRU brings us an opportunity to widen institutional partnerships and relationships on a critically important international stage, the Pacific Rim,&#8221; according to UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;Like the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/11/ucsc-earns-prestigious-honor-aau-membership.html">election of UC Santa Cruz to the Association of American Universities (AAU)</a> last fall, APRU membership recognizes the excellence of our faculty and programs and the global impact of our research.&#8221;</p>
<p>APRU was founded in 1997 by UCLA, UC Berkeley, University of Southern California, and California Institute of Technology with the goal of working together on solutions to worldwide problems. The group&#8217;s main research areas include global health, natural hazards and disaster risk reduction, women in leadership and sustainable cities. Six other University of California campuses are members.</p>
<p>If there was any doubt about the need for global cooperation, the COVID&#8211;19 pandemic has put that to rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;It illustrates the need for greater global competencies and international understanding and international problem solving,&#8221; said Richard Hughey, UC Santa Cruz interim vice provost of global engagement.</p>
<p>Becky George, UC Santa Cruz assistant vice provost of global engagement, said membership in the association raises the campus&#8217;s standing in the world because it is such a respected organization and because the membership is composed of leading universities of the Pacific Rim region known worldwide for their academic and research excellence. &#8220;Affiliation with the association and the members elevates our global reputation,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Through participating in the APRU, UC Santa Cruz will have multiple opportunities to dialogue with members and initiate direct partnerships with universities in the association, George added.</p>
<p>In normal times, the group offers a chance for representatives from the universities to meet for conferences and projects. There are chances for university presidents and administrators to connect as well as conferences for students and professors to attend research symposia and summer schools.</p>
<p>Like everything else, much of that has been canceled this year due to the pandemic, including a multi-hazard summer school that was supposed to take place in Tokyo and an undergraduate student leaders conference in Manila. Yet other opportunities do remain. Events on the group&#8217;s calendar include a global student health case competition in which teams of students address a pressing global health problem and a forum on artificial intelligence for social good in Bangkok in the fall.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has many of the same objectives as APRU, such as encouraging more women to serve as leaders at universities. Forty-three percent of faculty are female, and last year the university started a faculty community networking group for women in science, technology, engineering, and math.</p>
<p>&#8220;One goal is to make faculty leadership positions more accessible to a wider audience, thus improving the diversity of the pool from which we can recruit future faculty leaders,&#8221; Larive said.</p>
<p>Larive pointed out that from its founding in 1965, UC Santa Cruz has been committed to social justice and environmental sustainability. &#8220;We are interested to share our experiences and to learn about the strategies that have been successful at other APRU institutions,&#8221; she said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="88fbc1dd8072701751192fa6e50e1767"><name>restrictions-trails-recreational-spaces</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus directive - restrictions on select trails and recreational spaces</title><summary>Be advised that the campus is lifting some access and location restrictions while still maintaining closures of some locations.</summary><start-date>1587106800000</start-date><display-name>Campus directive - restrictions on select trails and recreational spaces</display-name><path>/2020/04/restrictions-trails-recreational-spaces</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/04/restrictions-trails-recreational-spaces</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1587141132735</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594743529105</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>Effective April 16, 2020, the Santa Cruz County Health Officer lifted the supplemental order that previously had closed and prohibited the use of specific recreational spaces.

Making the molecular probes needed for this type of assay, however, has always been a difficult and time-consuming process.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Now, a team led by researchers at UC Santa Cruz has developed a method to create libraries of probes for high-throughput, large-scale assessments of T cell repertoires in blood samples. The new approach, described in a paper </span><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15710-1"><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">published April 20 in </span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Nature Communications</i></span></u></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, opens up new opportunities for immunological research, development of cancer immunotherapies, and assessing the immune responses of patients with viral infections, including COVID-19. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Every person in the field knows how cumbersome it is to make the probes for these assays,&#8221; said corresponding author Nikolaos Sgourakis, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;With conventional methods, you would need about a week to make a single peptide complex, but now we can make a plate of 100 in a day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">T cells play a central role in the immune system, complementary to antibodies (produced by B cells). Antibodies recognize and bind to antigens (foreign proteins) in the blood and other body fluids, whereas T cells only bind to antigens displayed on the surfaces of cells in the body, enabling the immune system to detect infected or cancerous cells. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">This difference makes antibody tests relatively straightforward and T cell assays much more challenging. To construct a probe for detecting a specific T cell receptor, the corresponding antigen must be incorporated into a molecular complex that mimics the way antigens are displayed on cell surfaces, bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. Sgourakis has been studying how protein fragments are selected and bound to MHC proteins in cells, and the new method builds on his lab&#8217;s discoveries about the role of &#8220;molecular chaperones&#8221; in this process.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Molecular chaperones are designed by nature to load MHC proteins with peptides in the cell, so we took our favorite chaperone and repurposed it,&#8221; Sgourakis said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">His previous research had shown that the chaperone can eject antigens that have low affinity for the MHC protein, ensuring that it binds only high-affinity antigens that can be displayed at the cell surface in the proper conformation to activate a T cell response. So Sgourakis designed a &#8220;placeholder&#8221; peptide for use in preparing large quantities of pre-loaded MHC complexes. When incubated with a high-affinity antigen, the placeholder is displaced, and this reaction can be performed in parallel with large numbers of antigens in a high-throughput system. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">It&#8217;s a force multiplier, enabling us to perform these reactions at high throughput,&#8221; Sgourakis said. &#8220;A lot of groups are working on similar methodologies, all of which have their pros and cons. This technology has the advantage of using the same system that cells use naturally, and we can combine it very elegantly with existing single-cell analytical tools.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">This work was done in close collaboration with researchers at the New York Genome Center and the University of Pennsylvania&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Hospital and Perelman School of Medicine. The researchers started to use the new method to develop libraries of probes for assessing T cell responses to neuroblastoma and designing cancer immunotherapies.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Then came COVID-19, and the team began exploring ways to apply the new technology to address the challenges of the novel coronavirus. With a viral infection, there are many different fragments of the viral proteins that an infected cell can display, and it is important to determine which of these peptides elicit a strong immune response.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Based on the coronavirus genome, we can predict all the possible peptides, synthesize them, load them onto MHC tetramers, and do a fishing expedition to find which ones are recognized by the T cells in blood samples from patients,&#8221; Sgourakis explained. &#8220;Certain peptides are immunodominant&#8212;they steer the immune response&#8212;and those are the ones we want to discover so we can potentially use them in a vaccine.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">This approach can also be used to compare the T cell receptor repertoires in different cohorts of patients. As people age, their T cell repertoire declines, resulting in a diminished ability to mount an immune response to a novel threat. This may be why older people are more vulnerable to COVID-19. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">One of the big questions is why there is so much variability in the severity of this disease,&#8221; Sgourakis said. &#8220;We can use this technology to screen patients and see what the gaps are in their T cell repertoires, and maybe use this as a diagnostic for which patients will need more intensive treatment.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">We&#8217;ve been working on this for so long, it is a significant body of work that is now being published, focusing on the mechanisms of biofilm formation and what makes the biofilm more infectious,&#8221; said Yildiz, a professor of microbiology and environmental toxicology. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Biofilms are important not only in causing infections, but also in the survival of cholera bacteria (</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Vibrio cholerae</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">) in the environment. In regions where cholera is endemic, </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>the </span></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">bacteria live in aquatic environments, typically in brackish water, causing periodic, seasonal outbreaks when sources of drinking water become contaminated. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">A surprising finding in the </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>PNAS</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> paper is that bacteria growing in biofilms have already activated the genes for virulence factors such as toxin production, before they have even infected a host. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Two of the main virulence factors are the toxin co-regulated pilus, which allows the bacteria to adhere to the intestine, and the cholera toxin which enters intestinal cells and makes people really sick,&#8221; said Jennifer Teschler, a postdoctoral researcher in the Yildiz lab and a co-first author of the paper. &#8220;These virulence factors are more highly expressed in biofilm cells, so they are already primed for causing infections.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The study also showed differences in the colonization patterns of free-swimming (&#8220;planktonic&#8221;) and biofilm-grown cholera cells in the intestines of infected mice. The researchers used a new imaging technique to make intestinal tissue transparent while preserving the spatial integrity of the infected intestines. This enabled them to see where the cholera bacteria had adhered to the villi, the finger-like projections that line the small intestine.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Being able to see where the infections are in three dimensions is an important tool for studying intestinal pathogens,&#8221; Teschler said. &#8220;In mice infected with planktonic cells, the cells were typically at the bottom of the villi, whereas biofilm cells attached at the top of the villi, closer to the lumen. We speculate that biofilm cells adhere more strongly to the villi, so they are better able to resist being swept away by the flow in the lumen of the intestine.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Two other papers, published </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15331-8"><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">March 25 in </span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Nature Communications</i></span></u></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> and </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008703"><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">March 16 in </span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>PLOS Genetics</i></span></u></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, focus on how free-swimming cholera bacteria attach to surfaces and initiate biofilm formation. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The bacterium has to attach to a surface, stop swimming, and start building a matrix,&#8221; Yildiz said. &#8220;Understanding the mechanisms involved in biofilm formation, as well as the role of biofilms in the overall biology of </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Vibrio cholerae</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, will pave the way for developing strategies to predict and control cholera epidemics. It may also help in identification of novel drug targets for inhibiting biofilm formation during infection.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Nature Communications</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> paper explores the cellular signaling pathways that control the attachment process through the regulation of hair-like appendages called pili that grow out from the cell surface. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Attachment is the initiating step of biofilm formation,&#8221; explained first author Kyle Floyd, a postdoctoral researcher in the Yildiz lab. &#8220;As a swimming cell nears a surface, the pilus will bind to the surface, and retraction of the pilus helps pull the cell closer to the surface. The cell then makes more pili to anchor it down to the surface.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">There are different classes and subclasses of bacterial pili, and the one required for biofilm formation in many </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Vibrio cholerae</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> strains (the type IV MSHA pilus) is regulated by a signaling molecule called c-di-GMP. The new study showed that the MSHA pilus is a dynamic system that extends and retracts and is directly controlled by c-di-GMP. The study showed how pilus activity is modulated by the interactions of c-di-GMP with other components of the pilus system.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>PLOS Genetics</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> paper further elucidates the c-di-GMP signaling pathways that promote biofilm formation. In particular, the study looked at the role of the flagellum, a whip-like appendage the bacteria use to swim, in c-di-GMP signaling. The researchers found that loss of the flagellum leads to elevated levels of c-di-GMP in the cell and increased expression of biofilm genes. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">It required powerful and elegant genetics to work out the connections between flagellum assembly, production of pili on the cell surface, biofilm matrix production, and c-di-GMP signaling,&#8221; Yildiz said. &#8220;There are different steps where this signaling molecule can control the transition to biofilm formation.&#8221;</span></p>

The only thing missing was an undergraduate major.&#160;</p>
<p>That's about to change.</p>
<p>Beginning this fall, students will have an opportunity to enroll in a new agroecology major, an interdisciplinary program housed in the Environmental Studies Department.</p>
<p>As an academic discipline, agroecology focuses on the basic ecology of agricultural systems with the goal of designing farming methods that conserve resources, maintain yields, and protect the health of people and surrounding natural landscapes. It encompasses conservation biology, political ecology, and political science and builds on ecological principles such as nutrient cycling, biodiversity, and predator-prey relationships.&#160;</p>
<p>"A lot of sustainable agriculture programs don't include the social sciences," said Stacy Philpott, a professor of environmental studies and the director of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS). "They call themselves interdisciplinary because they include chemistry, physics, and biology. We are thinking about chemistry and biology&#8212;but also about the sociological and political ramifications of food production."</p>
<p>Critical topics include farming practices, the use of pesticides and herbicides, corporate control over seeds, and problems related to food distribution and access.</p>
<p>The new major incorporates ecological concepts, the development of sustainable agricultural systems, and hands-on experiences. The core curriculum builds on three classes and at least one internship: a natural science-focused lab course based at the UCSC Farm; a social science-based class that focuses on food justice aspects of agroecology; and a hands-on class that establishes the foundation for subsequent independent work, said Philpott. Like the environmental studies major, students must meet a senior exit requirement by writing a senior thesis or doing a senior-level internship, or taking a senior seminar or capstone class.</p>
<p>Students have access to CASFS, which manages the UCSC Farm, perhaps the oldest university-based organic farm in the country, and the Alan Chadwick Garden, both sites where undergraduates have opportunities to work, learn, and intern.&#160;</p>
<p><em>"International leaders in their field"</em></p>
<p>Damian Parr (B.A., Kresge College, environmental studies, 2000), research and education coordinator for CASFS, was instrumental in getting the new major approved, having helped design a major at UC Davis in sustainable agriculture and food systems. Parr experienced learning from "international leaders in their field" at UCSC before earning a master's in international agricultural development and a doctorate in agricultural and environmental science education from UC Davis.</p>
<p>"UCSC has played a lead role in advancing this field from the very beginning," said Parr, who is also a 1991 graduate of the <a href="https://casfs.ucsc.edu/apprenticeship/apprenticeship-information/index.html#Apprenticeship">Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture</a>. "There were robust academics doing research and developing courses decades before anyone else. The apprenticeship and the student garden project and farm were way ahead of their time."</p>
<p>Over the years, the program integrated practice and partnerships with community stakeholders to encompass justice and inclusivity, environmental degradation, pesticide management, and wildlife and water conservation. "It's been my goal to create a major like this," he said. "It's central to our mission as a hybrid liberal arts and research university, to have commitments to both the ethical and empirical sides of research and education."</p>
<p>Environmental Studies has offered a "concentration" in agroecology that has been popular with undergraduates, attracting 25-30 students per year. In addition, 250-300 undergraduates take agroecology classes and internships every year, according to Philpott. Courses address plant physiology, the anthropology of food, research ecology, food sovereignty and social movements, as well as farming practices and ecological stewardship of the land. Professor Emeritus Steve Gliessman literally wrote the book on agroecology, authoring the first textbook in the discipline, and it was time to formalize the programming as a major, said Philpott, noting that the concentration will no longer be offered to new students beginning this fall.</p>
<p>"We started losing students to other schools who offered programs," she said, noting that UC Davis offers a sustainable agriculture major. "This will boost our recruitment of high school and community college students." Philpott expects to enroll about 150 majors.</p>
<p>"This new major acknowledges the work our students are already doing in this area," she said. "Agroecology is the way of the future, and we need to be able to train students in the theory, farming practices, research practices of organic agriculture, and the sociopolitical ramifications of agroecology. We really need it."</p>
<p>Philpott said she "takes issue" with the assertion that we must intensify agricultural systems to feed the world's population. "Really what the industrial food system is producing is food for cars and food for cows&#8212;grain they weren't evolved to eat&#8212;and grain to make Coke and candy," she said. "Agroecological food systems produce food that actually feeds people, here and in the developing world."</p>
<p>The job prospects for graduates are strong, she said, noting that alumni of the agroecology concentration are working in education, as farmers, in research positions at the Almond Board of California and Driscolls, coordinating farmers markets, in the cannabis industry, and more.</p>
<p>With a nod to UCSC's decades-long leadership in the field of agroecology, Philpott acknowledged the early support of Alfred Heller and his wife Ruth, who were early and vocal advocates of an agroecology major. Their establishment of the <a href="https://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/support-us/faculty-excellence/alfred-e-heller1.html">Ruth and Alfred Heller Endowed Chair in Agroecology</a>&#8212;the first endowed chair at UCSC, which Philpott now holds&#8212;continues to provide invaluable support to campus programs.&#160;<span>Alfred Heller died in December; a new $100,000 grant from the Clarence E. Heller Charitable Foundation, made in his honor, will help support the launch of the new major.</span></p>
<p>"This is definitely the culmination of a lot of things, and I think people have assumed we've had this for a long time," said Philpott. "We're able to launch this new major without creating new classes or hiring new faculty, and we'll be able to be more formally recognized for this education we're providing students."</p>

How these changes will affect Antarctic krill is a crucial question, because this abundant crustacean is an important food source for a wide range of animals, from penguins to whales. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">One species, the crabeater seal, feeds almost exclusively on Antarctic krill. Researchers have now used data from tracking studies of crabeater seals to</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span> build a habitat model that can be used to infer the distribution of krill and project how it is likely to change in the future. The study, </span></span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0745-9"><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>published </span></span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>April 27</span></span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span> in </span></span></u></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Nature Climate Change</i></span></u></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>, was led by scientists at UC Santa Cruz.</span></span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">We&#8217;re using the feeding behavior of this one predator as an indicator of the habitat for their prey and how that could change,&#8221; said first author Luis Huckstadt, a researcher in the Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS) at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Coauthor Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of the IMS, has been studying crabeater seals in Antarctica for many years, using electronic tags to track their movements at sea and, at the same time, collect environmental data. Crabeater seals swim at the surface when traveling and only dive when they are feeding on krill, so the tracking data clearly indicate where krill are located and, when combined with remote sensing data, what the oceanographic conditions are at those sites. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Huckstadt and his coauthors used these data, together with oceanographic circulation models, to build a high-resolution, 3-dimensional model of current crabeater seal foraging habitat and, by inference, krill habitat along the western Antarctic Peninsula. The researchers then ran the model under conditions expected in the future as the climate continues to change. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Their projections indicate that areas of krill habitat along the northern part of the peninsula will shrink and move farther offshore, while becoming more extended in the southern part, south of Alexander Island and in the Bellinghausen Sea. The reduced foraging habitat in the north occurs primarily during the summer months, when many other krill predators join crabeater seals in the hunt for food. To adapt to the changes in krill distribution, predators will have to shift further south themselves, switch to other prey, or make longer foraging trips. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The shift in krill habitat away from coastal waters in the north has big implications for species like penguins and fur seals, which can&#8217;t make long foraging trips because they have to come back to land to feed their offspring,&#8221; Huckstadt said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Crabeater seals are not restricted to a colony and have more flexibility to follow their prey over large distances. They are also one of the few marine mammals that stays in Antarctica through the winter. Species such as humpback and minke whales that migrate to the region in the summer to feed on krill will have to travel farther to reach krill habitat, Huckstadt said. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">It will be challenging for a lot of species,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Things are changing so fast in Antarctica, the changes we&#8217;re seeing in our model might be coming sooner than we expected.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Another unknown is how the Antarctic krill fishery will affect the abundance of krill as the population responds to these changes in its habitat. Costa noted that the Antarctic Peninsula is the primary region where krill are fished. Climate change combined with increasing pressure from the krill fishery may have profound effects on this ecosystem.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">We don&#8217;t really have a good grasp on how fishing pressure will change in the future, and that&#8217;s one reason so many marine protected areas have been proposed for the western Antarctic Peninsula,&#8221; Huckstadt said. &#8220;The peninsula is critical habitat for krill, which is the most abundant and important prey species in this region. Everything depends on krill, so any changes will cascade through the ecosystem.&#8221;</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Preliminary data released today (April 21) to the San Francisco Local Agency Formation Commission (SF LAFCo) provides a disturbing snapshot of what app-based delivery and ridehailing workers are confronting with COVID-19, and demonstrates the urgent need for the city and platform companies to take more immediate actions to protect this vulnerable workforce.</p>
<p>According to the results of an online survey, conducted for SF LAFCo by a research team led by UC Santa Cruz professor Chris Benner, on-demand workers&#160;are struggling financially, with more than half losing 75-100 percent of their weekly earnings on the apps since February. Given this financial insecurity, nearly one third reported they still accepted jobs despite their fears of spreading or contracting the virus.</p>
<p>Workers surveyed are largely dissatisfied with how the platform companies have responded to COVID-19, with only one quarter reporting the apps are doing enough to protect them. More than two-thirds reported the apps are not providing training and information on how to protect themselves and their customers.</p>
<p>Highlights of survey results include:</p>
<ul>
<li>58% report not getting gloves and sanitizing products from the apps;</li>
<li>81% report that platform companies are not requiring customers to report that they are sick before they accept the job;</li>
<li>73% report that the apps are not providing financial support if they are exposed to or contract COVID-19.</li>
</ul>
<p>One worker wrote, &#8220;It&#8217;s Door Dash and they&#8217;re basically just saying &#8216;Try not to die!&#8221; Another driver wrote, &#8220;Rides should be only for essential workers going to and from work, as well as essential needs, not just anybody going anyplace.&#160;We are not prepared or trained for health care, should not be taking people as medical transport.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two thirds of those surveyed wanted public officials to take the following actions in response to COVID-19, given that they think platform companies are not adequately protecting them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide free sanitizer, gloves, and other protective equipment;</li>
<li>Provide emergency financial assistance;</li>
<li>Enforcement of laws to ensure they have access to unemployment, paid leave, and other benefits of city and state laws.</li>
</ul>
<p>"App-based workers have long struggled to have their rights recognized as employees and now are struggling to get basic protections from COVID-19 as they provide essential services to SF residents," said LAFCo Chair and Supervisor Sandra Lee Fewer. "Locally and at the state level, we must hold these companies accountable for protecting their workers, and I am proud of this groundbreaking study for bringing these issues to light.&#8221;</p>
<p>"These frontline workers are in dire financial straits, and their work exposes them to the public and coronavirus," said LAFCo Vice Chair Cynthia Crews-Pollock. "If these app companies continue to shirk their responsibilities to protect workers, the city should take action to compel them to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Board of Supervisors will vote today on LAFCo Commissioner and Supervisor Matt Haney&#8217;s legislation&#160;requiring platform companies take measures to protect the health and safety of on-demand food delivery employees.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz survey was conducted online between April 8-20 with 219 responses. Forty-one percent of those surveyed are primarily working on food and/or grocery delivery apps, 32% are working on ridehailing apps, and the rest are former app workers who are not currently working because of the pandemic. The survey is part of a larger study that SF LAFCo commissioned to examine the working conditions of app-based workers. The citywide in-person survey was suspended when the Bay Area went into shelter in place, and Benner&#8217;s research team pivoted to creating an online survey intended to measure the impact of coronavirus on this frontline workforce. The results from the initial survey, coupled with the online survey results, will be released next month.</p>
<p>The survey and broader study is funded by SF LAFCo, the San Francisco Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Annie E. Casey Foundation, and the Chavez Family Foundation.&#160;The Local Agency Formation Commission is an independent regulatory body that has oversight authority over CleanPowerSF, the city&#8217;s community choice energy program, and conducts special studies. It&#8217;s governed by a five-member commission that includes three members of the Board of Supervisors, Chair Sandra Lee Fewer, Gordon Mar and Matt Haney, a public member, Vice Chair Cynthia Crews-Pollock, and alternative public member Shanti Singh.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9f0f6f0e8072701751192fa69155474b"><name>costume-shop-masks</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz theater arts costume shop steps up to combat COVID-19</title><summary>Just a couple of weeks ago, Brent Foland never imagined he'd be building face masks for his fellow UC Santa Cruz employees.</summary><keywords>coronavirus mask makers UCSC UC Santa Cruz</keywords><start-date>1587510000000</start-date><display-name>Costume shop makes masks </display-name><path>/2020/04/costume-shop-masks</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/04/costume-shop-masks</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1587511521003</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1588974431991</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Theater Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Maureen Dixon Harrison</name><title></title><phone/><email>maureen@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/04/images/jenna-phillips-sewing-550.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/04/images/jenna-phillips-sewing-550.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jenna-phillips-sewing-550.jpg</name><display-name>jenna-phillips-sewing-550.jpg</display-name><file-size>260491</file-size><width>550</width><height>451</height></image><image-alt>jenna phillips sewing a mask</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/04/images/mask-colorful-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/04/images/mask-colorful-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mask-colorful-80.jpg</name><display-name>mask-colorful-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>67112</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>mask on a dummy</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Jenna Phillips sews a cloth mask that will be delivered to the campus Environmental Health and Safety Department for other campus employees to use.

(Photo by Jenna Phillips)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>With theaters dark, costume makers become mask makers to supply fellow UCSC employees</article-subhead><article-text><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a couple of weeks ago, </span>Brent Foland<span style="font-weight: 400;"> never imagined he'd be building face masks for his fellow UC Santa Cruz employees. As the manager of UCSC&#8217;s costume shop, he&#8217;s usually busy overseeing a vast wardrobe of apparel and making sure it&#8217;s in top shape for the next production.</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, with shelter-in-place requirements being observed, all that has changed. Theaters are dark for the foreseeable future, and face masks have become a key part in keeping us safe from the spread of the coronavirus.&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the last week, Foland and his assistant </span>Jenna Phillips<span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been hard at work sewing two varieties of coverings: face masks and neck gaiters. They&#8217;re coordinating the project with UCSC&#8217;s Environmental Health and Safety department (EH&amp;S), which so far has requested 750 shaped fabric masks and 50 gaiters.</span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foland first got the idea about making the masks after hearing from his union about other International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) around the country building masks for their communities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When it became obvious that the proper elastic was unavailable, I felt that we should help out,&#8221; said Foland. &#8220;We have a very full stock of sewing supplies, so I asked if there was any way Jenna and I could get approval to work in the shop, use the UCSC supplies, and get the masks to UCSC employees in need.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it&#8217;s only the two of them working in the shop, Foland and Phillips have made sure to place their sewing machines at least 10 feet apart. All of the material was already in stock in the costume shop, and they&#8217;ll purchase additional supplies if necessary.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shaped, woven fabric masks have two layers of fabric and elastic ear loops or two sets of ties. From cutting to completion, they take 25-30 minutes to make. Each also can have a surgical or dust mask inserted between the two layers for additional protection. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foland has put his supply of pipe cleaners to clever use by sewing one around the nose area, so the mask can be pinched to fit more snuggly.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaiters are worn around the neck and then pulled up over the nose and mouth, and take about 15-20 minutes to make.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foland and Phillips have an efficient system in place to speed up production where, instead of building complete masks then moving on to the next, they use a step-by-step process. &#8220;We are working on each step to make 25 to 40 front layers and the inner lining layers during the first half of the day, then after lunch we sew the two layers together and finish as many as we can before we leave,&#8221; said Foland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EH&amp;S staff pick up finished masks as they&#8217;re done and handle the distribution to employees throughout campus. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The costume shop deserves credit for generously offering to create cloth masks and for their willingness to work on campus during a time of such uncertainty,&#8221; said EH&amp;S director </span>Lisa Wisser<span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;The supply chain for masks of any kind is severely impacted, and the campus is not able to purchase and receive commercially made cloth masks as quickly as the costume shop can make them. We are currently supplying campus staff with disposable masks, but these cloth masks will be much more comfortable, especially for those who need to wear a face covering all day. This is truly a service to our campus community.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the mask needs for employees are met, if there are any overages, they&#8217;ll be sent to the University of California medical centers.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Jenna and I are both very thankful to the numerous people who approved this project and for allowing us to do something positive,&#8221; Foland said.&#160;&#160;</span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you missing the landscape of skyscraper redwoods and lush ferns? The hum of learning? The inspiration of art?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Institute of the Arts and Sciences is offering some relief with a new, virtual museum of sights, sounds, words, curricula, and even a quirky campus tour. It&#8217;s titled </span><a href="https://ias.ucsc.edu/art-without-distance" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art Without Distance</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and new content will be posted each week.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Almost immediately, when I realized classes were going online, I knew the institute had to figure out a way to continue to produce and to have students involved in culture and art,&#8221; said Rachel Nelson, interim director of the Institute of the Arts and Sciences, by phone from her home. &#8220;Galleries were closing. Music halls were closing, and there was a sense we somehow were going to be denied art.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspiration struck as she walked through the nearly deserted campus thinking about how so many would miss the beauty of the hilltop site and realized there was already a way to virtually roam the campus while also considering its stories, histories, and secrets. A 2015 project by artists Harrell Fletcher, Molly Sherman, and Nolan Calisch titled, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collective Museum,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had collected stories and photographs of some 50 sites on the Santa Cruz campus. Nelson made it the first exhibit on the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art Without Distance </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">site.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viewers of the </span><a href="https://iascollectivemuseum.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collective Museum</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can hear a story by Professor Emeritus of MCD Biology Harry Noller about how, in the mid 1980s, then-Chancellor Robert Sinsheimer first broached the idea of sequencing the human genome to three professors on campus and also view the room where it happened. They can see a photo and read about why Oakes lower lawn is so important to alumnus Danny Rodriguez, a first-generation college student from Los Angeles who not only saw his first shooting star from the expanse of green but later walked across the same field on graduation day. Or they can finally answer the question of why there is a merry-go-round outside Thimann Labs.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its second week, a video tour and stories about </span><a href="https://ias.ucsc.edu/content/2020/solitary-garden-online-experiences-0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solitary Garden</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a participatory public sculpture and garden project by New Orleans artist </span><a href="https://magazine.ucsc.edu/2020/02/a-growing-movement/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">jackie sumell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that examines solitary confinement, justice, and the prison-industrial complex, were posted on the site.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of the virtual exhibits will be used in classroom curricula, including literature, art, and humanities courses, according to Nelson.&#160;</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art Without Distance</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will also include visual essays; blogs; social media posts on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter; and a virtual presentation of Carlos Motta&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We the Enemy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exhibit, which tracks the persecution of LGBTQIA+ individuals from colonialism to HIV/AIDS research. The virtual version of the exhibit, done in collaboration with SFMOMA, will include videos and an interview of Motta by Nelson.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Nelson, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art Without Distance</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a place to share experiences, feelings, and ideas, and also a way to cultivate imagination, innovation, and creativity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have to believe imagination is important in these times and that we can have rich lives that are happy and creative and innovative and are not in response to this pandemic; that we can hold onto something else,&#8221; Nelson said. &#8220;The answer lies in our ability to imagine something other than this.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9f27e4288072701751192fa68f4d18ce"><name>leadership-forum-viewing-details</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Leadership forum viewing details</title><summary>We are looking forward to the Chancellor and Senior Leadership Forum this Thursday, and we hope you will be able to join us! </summary><start-date>1587452400000</start-date><display-name>Leadership forum viewing details</display-name><path>/2020/04/leadership-forum-viewing-details</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/04/leadership-forum-viewing-details</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1587513123851</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1587513123851</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span>Dear UCSC Staff,</span><br/><br/><span>We are looking forward to the Chancellor and Senior Leadership Forum this Thursday, and we hope you will be able to join us!

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://ucscslugsupport.communityfunded.net/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 Slug Support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> campaign is a runaway success, and its momentum keeps building day by day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two weeks ago, the campaign had raised an impressive $81,000 since its inception in late March, with 246 donors stepping up to help. Now, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before that amount will double.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of this writing, the fundraising total is nearly $150,000, with almost 550 supporters contributing, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">alumni, students, staff, and faculty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We are overwhelmed with the outpouring of support our community has given and continues to give to this campaign,&#8221; said Emily </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denning Todd, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s&#160;assistant director of annual and digital giving,&#160;who is leading the charge for this campaign.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign benefits </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz's most vulnerable students during the COVID-19 crisis, which has placed an additional strain on their resources. They face a wide range of challenges, from financial hardships to gaps in access to technology, as well as health issues and food insecurity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donating to this cause is&#160;</span><a href="https://ucscslugsupport.communityfunded.net/?cfpage=project&amp;project_id=35369&amp;t=1585849539"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as easy as clicking on a button</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign has received monetary contributions as well as equipment donations from all across the UC Santa Cruz community. The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;Jacques M. Littlefield Foundation, a charitable organization, contributed a $35,000 gift.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funds raised from this campaign, along with contributions </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from the Chancellor&#8217;s Office, the Top It Off Fund, and the Dean of Student Success, have been used to purchase laptops for students. NETGEAR, a computer networking company based in San Jose, donated 300 modems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This community response has been unbelievable,&#8221; said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Assistant Vice Provost for Student Success Gwynn Benner, who has been facilitating the launch of the new laptop lending program called&#160;Slug Tech as part of this campaign.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many students have moved back to their homes because of the ongoing epidemic. This disruption has complicated their lives, with students being called upon to earn extra money in households with parents who have lost jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others live in homes without reliable access to wifi. Some don't have, or are sharing, functioning laptop computers. &#8220;With family members all now sheltered in place at home, our students are struggling to find time on a shared computer. They must juggle computer time with their siblings, and with parents or guardians who are also working remotely,&#8221; notes Benner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who remain on campus can no longer rely on access at UC Santa Cruz computer labs and libraries because both have been shuttered during the COVID-19 crisis.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the face of these issues, this fundraiser is aiding students in several ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing food stability for students through digital gift cards, Instacart purchases, and meal swipes to campus dining halls that remain open. Slug Support also connects students to CalFresh for long-term food needs and supports campus food pantries, which remain open for students in need.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding students in dire need of emergency housing and providing rent support for students who may have lost wages due to reduced work hours.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connecting Slug Support case managers to students who may be in isolation/quarantine to address their needs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing distance learning resources through Slug Tech. Slug Tech is working to ship students new laptops, assist in internet booster needs, and provide additional technology to help students function during this time of remote learning.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporting students who have returned home or taken a leave of absence by connecting them to their local resources for health insurance, mental health services, and unemployment benefits.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Given the immense amount of uncertainty during this time, the need to support our students will likely continue to grow,&#8221; Todd said. &#8220;We plan to continue the campaign as long as funds are needed. Our hope is to support every student undergoing financial hardship."</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a3e3af458072701751192fa613342e54"><name>upcoming-covid-19-experiences-survey</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Upcoming COVID-19 experiences survey</title><summary>Starting Friday, April 24, invitations to complete a COVID-19 experiences survey will go out to faculty and staff on behalf of Chancellor Cynthia Larive. </summary><start-date>1587538800000</start-date><display-name>Upcoming COVID-19 experiences survey</display-name><path>/2020/04/upcoming-covid-19-experiences-survey</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/04/upcoming-covid-19-experiences-survey</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1587592539945</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1594758153750</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>Starting Friday, April 24, invitations to complete a COVID-19 experiences&#160;survey will go out to faculty and staff on behalf of Chancellor Cynthia Larive.

Sharma, who studies the mechanisms behind &#8220;epigenetic&#8221; inheritance, is one of 15 young scientists to receive the prestigious award this year.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The Searle Scholars Program makes grants to selected universities and research centers to support the independent research of exceptional young faculty in the biomedical sciences and chemistry. The program supports high-risk, high-reward research across a broad range of scientific disciplines.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Sharma&#8217;s research focuses on the process by which the effects of environmental stresses can be transmitted from one generation to the next. Several lines of evidence suggest, for example, that a father's diet or experience of famine can affect the health and longevity of his children and grandchildren. These effects are not the result of mutations or other genetic changes to the DNA passed down in the chromosomes, but are thought to be mediated by &#8220;epigenetic&#8221; factors that change how genes are expressed.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Although there is mounting evidence from worms to humans suggesting that the parent&#8217;s environment can influence their offspring, the mechanism of such intergenerational inheritance remains deeply mysterious,&#8221; said Sharma, who received the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/09/sharma-innovator-award.html">NIH Director&#8217;s New Innovator Award</a> from the National Institutes of Health in 2019. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Sharma&#8217;s previous work made significant advances in understanding intergenerational epigenetic inheritance. She showed that epigenetic information related to the father's diet is transmitted to offspring via sperm, and that the carriers of this epigenetic information are small RNA molecules that are produced by the cells of the epididymis, the tubule in which sperm mature after leaving the testes. This research provided the first direct evidence of RNA-mediated communication between non-reproductive body cells (called somatic cells) and the germ cells (sperm). </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">These astonishing observations provide a focus for my current research, which aims to elucidate the mechanism of RNA-mediated soma-germline communication, and its consequences to offspring health,&#8221; Sharma said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Over the next few years, her lab will examine the biogenesis of small RNAs in mammalian sperm and investigate how exposure of an organism to various environmental conditions alters or reprograms the small RNA payload of its sperm to affect its offspring.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a863dc7d8072701751192fa672167521"><name>ramirez-ruiz-aaas</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomer Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences</title><summary>Other new members of the class of 2020 include singer Joan Baez, former Attorney General Eric Holder, and poet and playwright Claudia Rankine.</summary><start-date>1587625200000</start-date><display-name>Astronomer Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences</display-name><path>/2020/04/ramirez-ruiz-aaas</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/04/ramirez-ruiz-aaas</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1587668048992</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1587668363503</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/02/images/enrico_ramirez-ruiz-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/02/images/enrico_ramirez-ruiz-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>enrico_ramirez-ruiz-350.jpg</name><display-name>enrico_ramirez-ruiz-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>72727</file-size><width>350</width><height>351</height></image><image-alt>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2019/02/images/enrico_ramirez-ruiz-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2019/02/images/enrico_ramirez-ruiz-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>enrico_ramirez-ruiz-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>enrico_ramirez-ruiz-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16877</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz (Photo by Elena Zhukova)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Other new members of the class of 2020 include singer Joan Baez, former Attorney General Eric Holder, and poet and playwright Claudia Rankine</article-subhead><article-text><p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, has been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, one of the nation's oldest and most prestigious honorary societies.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Ramirez-Ruiz, who holds the Vera Rubin Presidential Chair for Diversity in Astronomy, was among 276 new members of the academy </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="https://www.amacad.org/2020-member-announcement"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">announced this week</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, including singer Joan Baez, former Attorney General Eric Holder, filmmaker Richard Linklater, and poet and playwright Claudia Rankine. Ramirez-Ruiz joins 24 other UCSC faculty who are fellows of the academy.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Founded in 1780, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences honors exceptional scholars, leaders, artists, and innovators and engages them in sharing knowledge and addressing challenges facing the world.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">A theoretical astrophysicist, Ramirez-Ruiz is a leading authority on some of the most </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">dramatic</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> events in the universe, such as collisions, mergers, and disruptions of stars&#8212;especially those involving compact objects like black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs. Using computer simulations to explore these transient phenomena, his research addresses fundamental questions in high-energy astrophysics and provides a framework for understanding the observational data coming from new telescopes, gravitational wave detectors, and astronomical surveys.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Ramirez-Ruiz has also worked vigorously to support the promotion and retention of women and people from under-represented groups in astronomy and related fields. He established and directs the Lamat program, which gives undergraduate students, </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">mostly</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">from</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> historically marginalized groups, the opportunity to work with UCSC faculty and graduate students on research project</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">s</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">using</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> some of the world&#8217;s most advanced computers. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The members of the class of 2020 have excelled in laboratories and lecture halls, they have amazed on concert stages and in surgical suites, and they have led in board rooms and courtrooms,&#8221; said Academy President David Oxtoby. &#8220;With today&#8217;s election announcement, these new members are united by a place in history and by an opportunity to shape the future through the academy&#8217;s work to advance the public good.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The American Academy of Arts and Sciences is both an honorary society that recognizes and celebrates the excellence of its members and an independent research center convening leaders from across disciplines, professions, and perspectives to address significant challenges. Current members represent today&#8217;s innovative thinkers in every field and profession, including more than two hundred and fifty Nobel and Pulitzer Prize winners.</span></p>

The book culminates several years of research on ways the human body has been employed to spark political change or as a medium for expression.<br/><br/>&#8220;I&#8217;m really excited to be able to devote the next year to his project,&#8221; Bargu said. &#8220;I feel it's really time to bring this to fruition.&#8221;<br/><br/>The Institute for Advanced Study, based in Princeton, brings together scientists and scholars to extend human knowledge. The American Council of Learned Societies awards fellowships recognizing excellence in research in the humanities and social sciences that employ humanities-related methods. <br/><br/>Bargu&#8217;s project draws on the approaches of disciplines including anthropology, political science, and cultural studies.<br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s a book about people using their bodies in struggles against oppression,&#8221; Bargu said.<br/><br/>Among the forms of expression she examines are hunger strikes, die-in protests, and voluntary human shielding. One chapter focuses on Mohamed Bouazizi, a street vendor who lit himself on fire outside Tunisian government offices in 2010 after complaining about police harassment and corruption. The act is considered a spark for the Arab Spring pro-democracy protests that swept Arab nations the following year.<br/><br/>Corporeal Politics delves into how people use their bodies in protest and how some expressions of self-directed violence come to catalyze wider actions. It&#8217;s an argument against previous studies of the body in politics that have tended to focus on how bodies are victimized as targets of violence.<br/><br/>&#8220;Even in the most difficult of circumstances, people have used their bodies in sometimes heartbreaking ways to make a point,&#8221; she said. <br/><br/>While the fellowship will enable Bargu to pursue research with no teaching duties for the year, she emphasized the value of teaching in the development of her ideas. <br/><br/>&#8220;Teaching and research are always mutually reinforcing,&#8221; Bargu said. &#8220;A lot of ideas have gestated in moments of preparation, in reading for courses. Thinking happens through dialogue. Being in conversation with students has also made space to hear other perspectives and avoid making mistakes. Grad students are excellent correctors of half-baked ideas.&#8221;<br/><br/>Bargu is originally from Istanbul. Before joining UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s faculty, she taught at the New School for Social Research in New York. She has a year-old son with her partner, Professor Massimiliano Tomba, who himself has won a fellowship at the Davis Center at Princeton University for the coming year.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="acb93b4a8072701751192fa624d54808"><name>new-county-order-on-face-coverings</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New county order on face coverings</title><summary>Santa Cruz County issued a new order today that requires staff and patrons at essential businesses to wear face coverings to help reduce the spread of COVID-19.

<p>Coonerty is one of 11 people selected to join the third class of fellows. The fellowship was launched to help educational institutions and communities foster and protect free speech and civic engagement. Among the fellows are students, professors, policymakers, and senior administrators, all of whom are addressing issues of expression, academic freedom, and campus life.</p>
<p>Coonerty, who represents the third district of Santa Cruz County, which includes the campus, will use the year-long fellowship to pursue his project, "Skokie: Free Speech and Community." Nearly 50 years ago, Nazis attempted to march through Skokie, Illinois, a community that, at the time, had the highest percentage of Holocaust survivors in the United States.</p>
<p>"We can see Skokie&#8217;s impact to this&#160;day in Charlottesville and on college campuses across the country," said Coonerty.&#160;"I'm going to research this pivotal&#160;event and develop a mock trial teaching module that can be used in different courses."</p>
<p>A graduate of the University of Virginia School of Law, Coonerty teaches courses on democracy and constitutional law for the Legal Studies program, as well as a course on anti-Semitism and the law for Jewish Studies. He began teaching at UCSC in 2003 and is also a visiting instructor at the Panetta Institute for Public Policy at California State University, Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>Coonerty is the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2007/03/1089.html">author of <em>Etched in Stone</em></a><em>: Enduring Words from Our Nation's Monuments </em>and coauthor of <em>The Rise of the Naked Economy: How to Benefit from the Changing Workplace</em>. In December, Coonerty delivered a talk entitled, "<a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/KtbxLvHgPhXpHHXBngPKZKKTnHWvddWCWg?projector=1">Local Government: Where Democracy Goes to Live</a>," as part of TEDx Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The Washington, D.C.-based&#160;<a href="https://freespeechcenter.universityofcalifornia.edu/">UC National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement</a>&#160;was established to explore "how the fundamental democratic principles of free speech and civic engagement must adapt to the challenges and opportunities of modern society." Its mission is to defend and advance these values through research, advocacy, debate, and discussion.</p>
<p>Fellows spend a year researching the topic of their choice. Each fellow develops educational materials and programs that can serve as a roadmap to safeguarding and encouraging the free exchange of ideas while simultaneously ensuring the institutional values of equity and inclusion. Each fellow will spend time on one of the 10 UC campuses to dialogue with students, faculty, administrators and others to inform their work.</p>

This module is replacing the previous appraisal tool (appraisals.ucsc.edu) with a secure, online evaluation platform through UCPath.</span></p>
<h3><strong>What&#8217;s Changing with ePerformance</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ePerformance differs from the previous appraisal tool in a few ways that will make the creation of appraisals easier than before:&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annual performance evaluations can be created in large batches, rather than one-by-one</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no need to manually set up signature hierarchies, as these are automatically generated in ePerformance</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, supervisors can track their employee&#8217;s performance throughout the appraisal period with Performance Notes. Both s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">upervisors and employees can also now nominate colleagues to participate in an employee&#8217;s annual performance evaluation.</span></p>
<h3><strong>ePerformance Rollout Timeline</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ePerformance module will be integrated over time in conjunction with UCSC&#8217;s staff annual evaluation timeline:</span>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>4/1/20 - 4/30/20: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff Human Resources works with divisional ePerformance administrators to create batch evaluations</span></p>
<p><strong>4/1/20 - 4/30/20:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Annual performance evaluations created by divisional ePerformance administrators in preparation for completion by managers of the 2019-2020 performance cycle</span></p>
<p><strong>5/5/20 - 8/14/20:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Training for supervisors for the 2019-2020 annual performance cycle</span></p>
<p><strong>8/31/20:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Annual performance appraisals due for represented employees</span></p>
<p><strong>9/4/20:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Staff Human Resources survey is sent out to divisions for feedback on the ePerformance tool and processes</span></p>
<p><strong>Fall 2020: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">As communicated in the Chancellor&#8217;s message to the campus on April 16, 2020, the due date for annual performance appraisals for non-represented staff has been delayed from July 31, 2020, until a date to be determined in the Fall.</span></p>

<p>Its twists and turns are explored in depth in the new two-volume book <a href="https://exhibits.library.ucsc.edu/exhibits/show/seeds/home"><em>Seeds of Something Different: An Oral History of the University of California, Santa Cruz</em></a>. The 925-page work was completed over five years by alumni Irene Reti (Kresge '82, environmental studies; M.A. '04, history), Sarah Rabkin (SciCom '85), and Cameron Vanderscoff (Cowell '11, history and literature). The editors pored through hundreds of interviews by campus and local leaders collected by the university&#8217;s Regional History Project in the University Library&#8217;s Special Collections.</p>
<p>Reti said the project was inspired by a desire to share the rich treasure trove of oral history and collection of photos and campus posters with the public. It features more than 200 narrators as well as 250 images.</p>
<p>&#8220;This book is a kind of time machine,&#8221; Reti said. &#8220;[It] is not a dry academic monograph. It reads more like fiction, or a play, a conversation across time.&#8230;The tone of the book is by turns celebratory, passionate, humorous, ecstatic; sometimes anguished, angry, elegiac. Our characters are full of both dreams and doubts.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz was founded by people who wanted to change the way learning was done in America, said Vanderscoff in a radio interview. They hoped to give students who weren&#8217;t rich a chance to experience the best of a private liberal arts university and a research university.</p>
<p>The beauty of the campus location was a key component from the beginning. &#8220;This is a place that feels transformative when you&#8217;re there,&#8221; Vanderscoff said, explaining that it&#8217;s a place where it feels the seeds of something different are possible. &#8220;This is a place where people could reinvent themselves, to reinvent learning,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The book&#8217;s cover features a photograph by Ansel Adams, who many people don&#8217;t realize was UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s first photographer. Ten additional photos by him are included as well as those of 35 other photographers including Joel Levick (Porter '78, aesthetic studies), Shmuel Thaler, Eric Thiermann (Cowell '69, literature and visual arts), Jim MacKenzie, and Reti.</p>
<p>The book goes through the rapid cultural changes experienced by the university shortly after its founding in 1965. There are voices talking about the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, the advent of the women&#8217;s and GLBT rights movements, and the interest in preserving the environment and promoting whole foods.</p>
<p>Other voices discuss later aspects of the university&#8217;s history, including the growing pains of budgetary constraints, tense college-board relationships, the high cost of living in Santa Cruz, and the ongoing conflict between the founding ideals and changes and constraints imposed by the larger University of California system.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is heartbreak here (as some of the early dreams of the founders are tempered by the budgetary realities of the state of California); there is a passion for the stunning redwoods we walk through every day and distress as some of that landscape is sacrificed to build campus infrastructure, as the campus grows and becomes a less intimate place than the one I arrived at in 1978 when there were only 5,000 students,&#8221; Reti said. The university now has 18,000 students.</p>
<p>&#8220;So much happened that it was difficult to find a coherent and compelling storyline,&#8221; Reti said. &#8220;We wanted to reach beyond both a narrative of decline (some people believe everything has gone downhill since Chancellor Robert Sinsheimer&#8217;s reorganization of the college system in the late 1970s) or a narrative of uncritical celebration of UCSC&#8217;s recent prestigious stature as a research university,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Reti and the other editors did not attempt to reconcile these conflicting viewpoints but instead gave space for readers to come to their own conclusions. &#8220;This is the beauty of oral history, which allows for multivocal viewpoints and does not ask us to reconcile them into a seamless message.&#8221;</p>
<p>The editors hope the book will lead readers to reflect on the changes that have occurred at UC Santa Cruz and dream about the future. &#8220;Our goal is not to sing a song of praise or lament, but say, &#8216;Well, what&#8217;s next?&#8221; said Vanderscoff.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ae718bcc8072701751192fa664ba5625"><name>alumnus-shines-on-making-the-cut</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumnus sews up $1 million prize on TV's Making the Cut</title><summary>Graduate Jonny Cota, competing against international designers, makes a splash on reality-style fashion show produced by model Heidi Klum and fashion consultant Tim Gunn.&#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the 35-year-old UC Santa Cruz alum has $1 million in the bank and a new namesake fashion line that is now for sale around the globe. The change came thanks to Cota&#8217;s big win on the first season of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making the Cut</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a reality-style fashion competition produced by model Heidi Klum and fashion consultant and everybody&#8217;s favorite uncle, Tim Gunn.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The L.A.-based Cota (Kresge '05, sociology; journalism minor) bested 11 other international designers to nab the top spot during the 10-episode show, which was aired on Amazon Prime. As part of the win, Cota also will have a one-year mentorship with Amazon&#8217;s fashion division, which according to promos, aims to help turn Cota&#8217;s designs into a &#8220;a global lifestyle brand.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was the most challenging, difficult, confronting experience of my life,&#8221; said Cota of the show during a telephone interview Friday. &#8220;And, to come out on top made it all so worthwhile. Every single designer on that show was challenged: how to work under pressure, how to defend yourself, how to pitch yourself. It was the fashion Olympics.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born into a family of seven kids in Martinez, Calif., Cota graduated with a degree in journalism. But instead of joining a newsroom, Cota took up with an underground performance art troupe as a stilt-walker and fire dancer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Skingraft website, Cota fell in love with the circus troupe&#8217;s ornate costumes and quickly moved from performing to costume design. He started his Skingraft label with his brother, Christopher Cota, in 2006. The name Skingraft came from his early design days when, without much of a budget, Cota haunted thrift stores for vintage leather jackets, which he deconstructed and turned into costumes for the group. His streetwear was edgy, dark, and urban, a pioneer of the new American avant-garde style, according to the company&#8217;s website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cota dressed entertainers like Rihanna, Beyonc&#233;, Justin Bieber, and P. Diddy. Some of Cota&#8217;s designs also were featured in movies and TV shows like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hunger Games</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">True Blood</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But even with a growing business and the opening of a hip, multi-brand store in L.A., Cota was hardly a household name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That all changed when he was picked for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making the Cut</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which took a dozen designer entrepreneurs from the streets of Paris and Tokyo to New York. Each week, contestants had to design clothes within a set of parameters&#8212;streetwear with a Tokyo vibe, a collab with another designer, and, once, using only fabric scraps. One offering in each challenge was supposed to be more avant-garde and the other was to be accessible. On every episode, one or more designers would be eliminated and the winner would have their accessible design instantly put up for sale on Amazon.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For the first three episodes, I was just trying to survive,&#8221; Cota said. &#8220;Then, halfway through I was, &#8216;Holy sh**, I might win this thing.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cota, who lives part-time in Bali where his clothes are made, said much of his fashion, despite its apparent darkness, is inspired by nature.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s the dark side of nature with skeletons and the wing patterns of butterflies, but animal imagery creeps into all of my fashion, which speaks a little to my time in Santa Cruz,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cota also strives for sustainability in his clothing lines, using eco-friendly material whenever possible and, because all his clothing (including what is being offered on Amazon) is cut to order, there is little waste.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We aren&#8217;t making thousands and thousands of pieces that might end up in the landfill,&#8221; Cota said. Part of the award money, he said, will go to invest in a new facility in Bali that will put sustainable practices at the forefront of his business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the show, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making The Cut</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> judges like Klum, model Naomi Campbell, and luxury ready-to-wear designer Joseph Altuzarra called Cota&#8217;s designs &#8220;effortlessly cool&#8221; and, once, &#8220;feminine but rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of his debut collection, which he dubbed "Metamorphosis,&#8221; Cota said, &#8220;I peeled back the hard layers to rediscover my tenderness, and celebrate resiliency.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His line came, Cota said on the show, &#8220;with a strong scream of a voice.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask Cota why fashion matters and his answer might surprise.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fashion doesn&#8217;t matter. Expression matters,&#8221; said Cota who is married to Hollywood costume designer Frank Helmer, &#8220;and fashion is one way to express ourselves. It helps craft identities. It helps celebrate significant moments in our lives. It helps us feel good when we feel down. I love fashion&#8217;s power to elevate us, to elevate our moods, to help us create identity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while fashion design was not in the front of his mind while at UC Santa Cruz&#8212;although he said the first thing he ever sewed were &#8220;patchwork hippie pants&#8221; that he sold out of his apartment at Kresge College&#8212;his time on campus contributed to his success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;&#8220;I would tell my younger self that all education is worthy education,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I stumbled between majors and finally ended up with sociology and journalism and then thought, &#8216;What am I going to do with that?&#8217; But going to school and committing yourself to something, no matter how many years it takes, gives you a strong work ethic and the ability to work toward your goals, and that will launch you in any direction you want.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My path wasn&#8217;t expected, but I use what I learned at UCSC every single day.&#8221;</span></p>

Starting May 1, the <a href="https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/molecular-diagnostic-lab">UCSC Molecular Diagnostic Lab</a> will begin doing coronavirus tests for the UCSC Student Health Center and other medical providers in the local community.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The campus will </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><strong>not</strong></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> be operating a testing site for the general public. The campus lab will work with local medical providers to test patient samples, initially partnering with the Student Health Center and Santa Cruz Community Health. The lab received approval last week from the California Department of Public Health as a COVID-19 temporary testing site.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Jeremy Sanford, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental (MCD) biology, said the lab will be able to return results within 24 to 48 hours; this rapid turnaround is essential to patients and the community in order to combat the spread of COVID-19. The lab will eventually have the capacity to test hundreds of samples per day, and the team plans to gradually increase the number of tests performed in order to meet the demand while ensuring a smooth operation.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">It&#8217;s truly amazing how far we&#8217;ve been able to come since we started planning for this in March,&#8221; said John MacMillan, associate vice chancellor for research </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">and professor of chemistry and biochemistry</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> at UCSC. &#8220;We are having ongoing discussions with the county and local medical providers about how we can help meet their needs for coronavirus testing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The testing performed at the UCSC lab detects the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. A positive test means the patient has an active infection. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Dr. Elizabeth Miller, medical director of the UCSC Student Health Center, said the campus diagnostic lab will enable the center to increase the number of students they test for the coronavirus. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">A significant increase in testing capacity is considered essential to ensure public health and safety once there is a loosening of the current &#8220;shelter in place&#8221; orders effective in Santa Cruz County and elsewhere in the state. </span></p>

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Nimmo joins 11 other UCSC faculty who are members of the academy, one of the highest honors a U.S. scientist can receive.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Nimmo&#8217;s research focuses on how planets and their moons have evolved to their current states, and what explains the planetary diversity we see. He has made significant contributions to the understanding of the internal structure and evolution of icy bodies of the solar system and the resulting influence on their surface processes. His research on the internal processes that affect plume activity at the southern polar region of Enceladus, for example, suggested that shear heating is at the origin of the plumes and heat flux on this moon of Saturn. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Other moons of giant planets Nimmo has studied include Europa, Ganymede, Titan, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, and Triton. He has also investigated the internal structure of Psyche, the largest metallic asteroid in the solar system, concluding that volcanoes of liquid iron may </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">have </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">erupt</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">ed</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> on such bodies. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Nimmo has been part of several NASA spacecraft missions, including the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission, which mapped the gravity field of the Moon; the Cassini mission, which carried out observations in the Saturn system; New Horizons, which flew past Pluto in 2015; </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">and InSight, which is currently measuring quakes on Mars.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Nimmo has received many awards and honors in recognition of his work, including most recently the Royal Astronomical Society&#8217;s 2019 Harold Jeffreys Lectureship and the Europlanet Society&#8217;s 2018 Paolo Farinella Prize. He earned his Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge, followed by appointments at the University of Cambridge, University College London, and UCLA. He joined the UCSC faculty in 2005.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bde619198072701751192fa646a81a38"><name>hand-sanitizer</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student Health Center Pharmacy partners to make hand sanitizer for campus</title><summary>With newly relaxed federal restrictions for pharmacies to compound hand sanitizer, pharmacy staff set out to create more hand sanitizer for the UCSC community.</summary><start-date>1587970800000</start-date><display-name>Hand sanitizer</display-name><path>/2020/04/hand-sanitizer</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/04/hand-sanitizer</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1588028905706</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1588112090841</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Kate Goff</name><title></title><phone/><email>kmgoff@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/04/images/hand-sanitizer-lab-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/04/images/hand-sanitizer-lab-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hand-sanitizer-lab-500px.jpg</name><display-name>hand-sanitizer-lab-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>175721</file-size><width>500</width><height>667</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Diane Lamotte,&#160;ancillary services director and senior pharmacist, makes hand sanitizer.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/04/images/hand-sanitizer-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/04/images/hand-sanitizer-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hand-sanitizer-500px.jpg</name><display-name>hand-sanitizer-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>98707</file-size><width>500</width><height>375</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>UCSC Research Safety Specialist Brian Gallagher from EH&amp;S.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Looking for hand sanitizer in the time of COVID-19? You're likely to find empty shelves and &#8220;out of stock&#8221; notices. But that didn't stop the UC Santa Cruz Student Health Center Pharmacy from filling the gap.</p>
<p>With newly relaxed federal restrictions for pharmacies to compound hand sanitizer, pharmacy staff set out to create more hand sanitizer for the campus community. But they faced an obstacle: a lack of the lab-grade, concentrated alcohol necessary to kill coronavirus.</p>
<p>One UCSC department knew where to find it: the Environmental Health &amp; Safety department. EH&amp;S tracked down the alcohol and a lab to compound the mixture. The Student Health Center provided the glycerine, hydrogen peroxide, containers and labels. Then Senior Pharmacist and Student Health Center Ancillary Services Director Diane Lamotte, RPh, partnered with UCSC Research Safety Specialist Brian Gallagher from EH&amp;S, and Lori Etow of the Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry Department. Using Etow&#8217;s lab, Lamotte and Gallagher created eighty four-ounce bottles of hand sanitizer, which the pharmacy sold for $2.50 each. In a few days, hand sanitizer sales were booming.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little more watery than commercial sanitizers and we don&#8217;t add scents or other additives, but it works just as well,&#8221; said Lamotte, noting that the hand sanitizer is good for 30 days.</p>
<p>Most commercial pharmacies wouldn&#8217;t have access to an on-site compounding lab. But UCSC's research facilities and staff expertise combined to meet the community's needs.</p>
<p>Students, staff, and faculty can buy hand sanitizer at the pharmacy, located in the Student Health Center.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="be1d26b58072701751192fa6f63df5f7"><name>follow-up-on-chancellor-and-leadership-forum</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Follow-up on Chancellor and Leadership Forum</title><summary>Thank you so much for your engagement with our Chancellor and Leadership Forum last week.

Supporting deer and squirrels, acorn woodpeckers and oak moths, these habitats occupy tens of thousands of acres across the state. Yet change is coming to these widespread habitats. Like much of the West, California&#8217;s foothills are predicted to experience shifts in climate in coming decades. Shifts in the amount and timing of precipitation, together with warming weather, are likely to affect how fast local soils will erode, how much water is stored below ground, and even whether oaks can survive where they are found today.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">To understand how these beloved woodlands will fare in a rapidly warming climate, UC Santa Cruz researchers are putting a headwaters stream in the Diablo Range under a hydrological microscope.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Our globe has a finite amount of water. Once it rains, where does water go? How long does it stay in our hill slopes? And what controls how it leaves in streams and through plants?&#8221; asks Margaret Zimmer, a professor of </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">E</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">arth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Zimmer has joined forces on the project with scientists from the <a href="https://ucnrs.org/tracking-water-through-california-ecosystems/">California Heartbeat Initiative</a></span><a href="https://ucnrs.org/tracking-water-through-california-ecosystems/"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">-</span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><a href="https://ucnrs.org/tracking-water-through-california-ecosystems/">Freshwater</a> (CHI-Freshwater). Together they are examining how plants, soils, and climate affect the way water moves through the landscape. What they find will demonstrate whether oaks and the ecosystems they support can survive in the future, or </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">if</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> the new conditions will leave oak woodlands, and the human communities they funnel water toward, high and dry.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The bucolic laboratory for this study is a catchment dubbed Arbor Creek Experimental Watershed. Located within <a href="https://ucnrs.org/reserves/blue-oak-ranch-reserve/">Blue Oak Ranch Reserve</a>, one of 41 reserves in the UC Natural Reserve System, the site should look familiar to anyone who has traveled through California&#8217;s rugged Coast Ranges. High on the western flank of Mount Hamilton, two slopes of ankle-twisting steepness come together in a narrow V. The little valley between them forms the birthplace of an ephemeral creek.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><strong>Distinctively different plants</strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Arbor Creek is a study in contrasts. The sunnier, south-facing slope is furred in bright green annual grasses. The cooler, north-facing slope supports a stand of blue and black oaks, now starting to bud out in leaves.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The compact size of the catchment, together with its dramatic vegetation differences, makes Arbor Creek an ideal study site. &#8220;The same amount of precipitation is falling on both slopes, and the subsurface structure is largely the same,&#8221; Zimmer says. &#8220;This lets us isolate how vegetation may drive differences in the storage and release of water from the landscape.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">However, tracking the fate of that water isn&#8217;t so easy. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have x-ray vision to see the water underground. It&#8217;s hard to visualize where the water&#8217;s coming from or going,&#8221; she </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">says</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><strong>A blanket of sensors</strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In lieu of Superman powers, Zimmer and her CHI colleagues are deploying a formidable array of instruments. The watershed positively bristles with gauges, meters, wells, and samplers.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The crowns of the hills and both slopes are outfitted with rain gauges. Three Clima-Views, the Swiss army knife of weather stations, are stationed at strategic points. Borehole wells monitor deep groundwater levels, while soil moisture probes track the water content of shallow soils.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Each device is designed to illuminate a portion of Arbor Creek&#8217;s water budget. The data they yield will reveal where water is being stored, when the water table fluctuates, and how plants are utilizing this precious seasonal resource.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><strong>The benefits of working together</strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The Arbor Creek research site is relatively new. Zimmer found it after joining the UC Santa Cruz faculty two years ago. At that point, CHI-Freshwater was already planning to conduct intensive landscape studies at Blue Oak Ranch Reserve.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">I toured many different watersheds and experimental forests,&#8221; Zimmer says. &#8220;The big draw to Blue Oak Ranch was the CHI initiative. I saw a lot of opportunities to leverage and bolster CHI&#8217;s objectives through my work.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Becca Fenwick, program manager for CHI-Freshwater, is equally pleased with this chance to do multidisciplinary science. &#8220;The breadth of expertise we now have from the people who are taking part in this project is phenomenal. They all bring different pieces of the puzzle,&#8221; says the UC Santa Cruz-based researcher.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The fact that Blue Oak Ranch is managed for research sealed the deal. &#8220;The staff here do everything in their power to accommodate our requests and make sure we&#8217;re supported. Being at a reserve has influenced our productivity and ability to do research,&#8221; Zimmer says.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The partnership has made the science more robust as well. By combining their financial resources, Zimmer and CHI were able to deploy more instruments at the research site. &#8220;By combining our resources, we&#8217;re able to bolster our ability to observe watershed function in these systems,&#8221; Zimmer says.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><strong>Calendar of plant thirst</strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">A key part of that budget is consumed by plants, which pull water from the subsurface and release it to the atmosphere. One of Zimmer&#8217;s graduate students, Amanda Donaldson, is tracking how plants&#8217; appetite for water varies across the seasons. The out-of-step life cycles of the plants enables her to isolate the appetite of the oaks from that of the grasses.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Right now, in winter, there are no leaves on the trees. They&#8217;re basically sleeping for a couple of months. They&#8217;re not taking up water from the subsurface. Versus the grasses, which are green and transpiring. They&#8217;re removing water from the first meter or so,&#8221; Donaldson says.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">As spring wears on, &#8220;there will be a time when both the trees and the grasses are transpiring. I want to know how differences in their water use patterns influence subsurface water storage,&#8221; she says</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">By midsummer, the annual grasses have died, and only the trees are transpiring. There&#8217;s even a brief point in winter when neither oaks nor grasses are growing.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">To quantify the amount of water the trees are transpiring, the team has installed sap flow meters on the trunks of the oaks. On the opposite slope, Donaldson will periodically place a dome over a patch of grass to monitor the rate of photosynthesis.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">How water fluctuates at Arbor Creek offer</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">s</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> a glimpse into California&#8217;s climate future. &#8220;If landscapes become hotter and drier, the south-facing slope may be what the north-facing slope will look like in the relatively near future,&#8221; Zimmer says.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Oak savannas that become grasslands will also change the amount of water stored in the ground. That, in turn, affects how much water streams carry to human communities downhill.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><strong>From moisture sensors to pixel data</strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Donaldson&#8217;s information about plants has a ready customer. The CHI-Freshwater team wants to correlate the water status of the plants with images they&#8217;re gathering on the site using drones. They want to know whether signals of moisture in the plants and soils are visible on drone and satellite images.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">If we can understand the mechanics of what&#8217;s happening in the ground, and detect that change in remote sensing data, we wouldn&#8217;t have to dig pits in soils and put sensors across the state,&#8221; says Becca Fenwick, coordinator for CHI-Freshwater. &#8220;Instead, we could use the remote sensing data to get that same information.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The remaining portion of Arbor Creek&#8217;s water budget is the moisture absorbed by the hills and trickling down the creek.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Measuring what escapes via the stream is relatively straightforward. To do this, the scientists have installed a white fiberglass chute across the valley&#8217;s narrowest point. The water level in the flume indicates the amount of water the creek carries.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">But the water that flows down streams isn&#8217;t entirely composed of the rain that most recently fell from the sky. In fact, &#8220;in any rain event, over 70 percent of the water you see in any stream was already in the soil, and 30 percent or less is actually new water,&#8221; says Emilio Grande, another of Zimmer&#8217;s graduate students.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><strong>Dating the water</strong></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Grande is puzzling out when the water in the stream arrived at Arbor Creek. Because that information affects water available to plants, it has a direct bearing on Donaldson&#8217;s vegetation research.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">If I know the age of the water when it leaves the system, I can say something about how long precipitation is going to reside within the slope, and how long that water potentially will be available for vegetation,&#8221; she says.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Estimating the age of water requires examining its various atomic formulations, or isotopes. Warm storms carry water containing heavier isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen than storms that form in the arctic. Grande periodically takes samples from the stream and from the rain gauges to identify the isotopic signatures of individual precipitation events. Once he knows how the isotopes in rain vary with time, he can use numerical models to figure out how much time it takes rainwater to become the water that is seen in the stream.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">After analyzing water from the catchment across a rainy season, Grande can use established formulas to calculate how much was old water already stored in the soil and how much was new precipitation just delivered from a cloud.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Those equations, however, were developed for places with year-round rain. &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to come up with something that better describes not only Mediterranean climates but also this kind of ephemeral stream,&#8221; Grande says. &#8220;Potentially we will come up with a new model that can explain the effect of these starts and stops.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Grande is double-checking this technique by analyzing sulfur and hydrogen isotopes in his rain and stream samples. Sulfur provides more accurate dates for &#8220;younger&#8221; water, while the hydrogen isotope known as tritium can age water that has lingered underground for more than 60 years.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">I am measuring the tritium in the rain when it falls. I am also measuring it in the water from down there at the flume,&#8221; Grande says. &#8220;Because I know how fast tritium decays, I can figure out how long has passed for that precipitation water to become stream water.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Grande&#8217;s work using radioactive isotopes to study catchment hydrology is on the cutting edge. The technique has only been practiced in a handful of places by very few researchers.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Grande&#8217;s findings lend themselves to predicting water storage functions across California, where more than half of rivers run dry for part of the year. Climate models point to less frequent but higher intensity precipitation in coming decades. Grande&#8217;s equations will indicate how well hill slopes can absorb those deluges, or how much flooding is in the cards.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><strong>Preparing for the future</strong></span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">If we know, we can better prepare ourselves by building bigger reservoirs, preparing for longer droughts, and bracing for higher-flow events,&#8221; Zimmer says.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The study has already piqued the interest of water resource managers at the Santa Clara Valley Water District. The district, which supplies metropolitan San Jose, is located directly downstream from Blue Oak Ranch. That makes the Arbor Creek findings particularly pertinent for the people of California, Zimmer says. &#8220;If you&#8217;re trying to develop infrastructure to store or release more water, you need to understand how these systems work, and how watersheds are going to persist in the future.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c78a3bcf8072701751192fa6ce4cf591"><name>zavella-book</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Zavella authors new book about reproductive justice</title><summary>Pat Zavella, professor emerita of Latin American and Latino studies, has published a new book about the reproductive justice movement that blends research, history, theory, and memoir.</summary><keywords>zavella, reproductive rights, latina, justice</keywords><start-date>1588143600000</start-date><display-name>Zavella-Book</display-name><path>/2020/04/zavella-book</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/04/zavella-book</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1588190657454</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1588190737166</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/04/images/zavella-pat-200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/04/images/zavella-pat-200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>zavella-pat-200.jpg</name><display-name>zavella-pat-200.jpg</display-name><file-size>75424</file-size><width>200</width><height>281</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Pat Zavella</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/04/images/zavella-pat-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/04/images/zavella-pat-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>zavella-pat-80.jpg</name><display-name>zavella-pat-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>6543</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Pat Zavella</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/04/images/zavella-book-cover_200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/04/images/zavella-book-cover_200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>zavella-book-cover_200.jpg</name><display-name>zavella-book-cover_200.jpg</display-name><file-size>42477</file-size><width>200</width><height>304</height></image><image-alt>Image of book cover</image-alt><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Pat Zavella, professor emerita of Latin American and Latino studies, has published a new book about the reproductive justice movement that blends research, history, theory, and memoir.</p>
<p>In her new book, <em>The Movement for Reproductive Justice: Empowering Women of Color through Social Activism</em>, Zavella showcases the collaborative work across racial lines of reproductive justice organizations and suggests that it provides a compelling model for truly intersectional social change movements.</p>
<p>Zavella draws on five years of ethnographic research to explore collaborations among women of color engaged in reproductive justice activism. While numerous organizations focus on reproductive justice, most are racially specific, such as the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum and Black Women for Wellness.</p>
<p>Zavella reveals that many of these organizations have built their own coalitions, shared resources, and supported each other. Though some coalitions are national, most are regional, and the organizations themselves have remained racially or ethnically specific, which presents unique challenges and opportunities for the women involved. These organizations provide a compelling model for negotiating across differences within constituencies, according to Zavella.</p>
<p><em>The Movement for Reproductive Justice&#160;</em>demonstrates that a truly intersectional movement built on grassroots organizing, culture shift work, and advocating for policy can offer visions of strength, resiliency, and dignity for all.</p>
<p>Zavella&#8217;s interest in the movement for reproductive justice is rooted in her own experience. She describes firsthand the trials and judgments she experienced as a working professional mother of color: her commitment to academia was questioned during her pregnancy, as she was shamed for having children "too young." When she became a professor, she felt out of place as one of the few female faculty members with children.</p>
<p>Zavella joined the faculty in 1983 and undertook years-long ethnographic research projects to document the experiences of Mexican Americans and migrants, exploring themes of family, work, identity, and immigration.</p>
<p>She is the author of <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2011/06/zavella-book.html"><em>I'm Neither Here nor There: Mexicans' Quotidian Struggles with Migration and Poverty</em></a>, and the coauthor of <em>Telling to Live: Latina Feminist Testimonios</em>. She also coedited <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2007/09/1587.html"><em>Women and Migration in the U.S.-Mexico Borderlands: A Reader</em></a>.</p>
<p>Zavella was a prominent member of the Social Sciences Division, serving as chair of the Latin America and Latino Studies department from 2007-2011 and again from 2014 until June 30, 2016. She also served as director of the Chicano/Latino Research Center and was selected in 2008 to deliver the Faculty Research Lecture, an honor conferred by her colleagues in the Academic Senate. She retired in 2017. She received her undergraduate degree from Pitzer College, and her masters and Ph.D. from UC Berkeley. She had a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford's Center for Chicano Research before joining the UCSC faculty.</p>
<p>Her new book is being warmly received, drawing praise from scholars and activists.</p>
<p>"With deft and nuance, Zavella provides a comprehensive and compelling overview of the U.S. reproductive justice movement," said Lisa Garc&#237;a Bedolla, vice provost for graduate studies and dean of the Graduate Division at UC Berkeley. "Her accessible, vibrant prose will leave readers both moved and inspired by this extraordinary movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Loretta J. Ross, co-Founder of <a href="https://www.sistersong.net/">SisterSong</a> Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, called it "an impressive, meticulously researched book."</p>
<p>"Zavella has expertly used her talents as an amazing writer to capture the voices and lived experiences of women of color who developed innovative praxis through reproductive justice activism," said Ross. "Rarely do writers who use reproductive justice in their titles have such a profound grasp of what it really&#160;means like she does.&#8221;</p>

We recognize that the situation is dynamic and evolving, and we will provide updated information as decisions are made.</span><br/><br/><strong><u>Decisions about remote vs. in-person instruction<br/></u></strong><span>Currently, we intend for the fall quarter to start as scheduled. We are monitoring the local and state public health situation to determine when and to what degree we can resume in-person instruction. Some or all instruction for a portion or all of the 2020-21 academic year may be delivered via remote and/or online instruction as conditions dictate. At this point we do not know exactly when these decisions can be made because the public health situation remains uncertain. We are monitoring the situation closely and will make a decision about the fall quarter as soon as there is adequate information to do so. The health and safety of our students, staff, and faculty is our top priority.</span><br/><br/><strong><u>Tuition and student fees for fall 2020<br/></u></strong><span>Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction continues to be offered remotely for any part of the 2020-21 academic year. Mandatory university charges for tuition and many charges for student services continue to help cover ongoing operations such as the delivery of instruction and the cost of student services such as registration, financial aid, and remote academic advising. While we acknowledge that our campus, like other UC campuses, has changed aspects of our operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the costs that campus-based fees are intended to cover continue as we maintain operations and prepare for the recovery to full operations.</span><br/><br/><strong><u>Student housing for fall 2020<br/></u></strong><span>Given the uncertainty of the ongoing public health crisis and the related decision about the manner of instruction for fall quarter, we want to provide you as much information as we can to help you make the best decision for you and your family. It is possible we will not be able to honor guaranteed housing for continuing students. More information will be shared as it becomes available.</span><br/><br/><span>I thank you for your understanding and patience during these challenging times. We will continue to inform you of the latest developments for the fall quarter and we are committed to providing students with the best educational experience possible.</span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz undergraduate and graduate students</audience><admin>Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cd4cc09f8072701751192fa62f713ebc"><name>deer-fawning-season</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Deer fawning season alert</title><summary>Please be aware that spring is the prime birthing season for a wide variety of campus wildlife, including deer.</summary><start-date>1588230000000</start-date><display-name>Deer fawning season alert</display-name><path>/2020/04/deer-fawning-season</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/04/deer-fawning-season</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1588287291515</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1588348844689</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/04/images/fawn.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/04/images/fawn.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fawn.250.jpg</name><display-name>fawn.250.jpg</display-name><file-size>115171</file-size><width>250</width><height>249</height></image><image-alt>fawn</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/04/images/fawn.80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/04/images/fawn.80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fawn.80.jpg</name><display-name>fawn.80.jpg</display-name><file-size>32776</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>fawn</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>If&#160; you see a fawn on its own it is likely just fine and is awaiting the return of its mother.

<p>Finding a fawn (baby deer) alone in the woods or a meadow is fairly common. Many people assume that young wildlife found alone are abandoned, helpless and need assistance for their survival. In nearly all cases this is a mistake, and typically human interaction does more damage than good. If you see a fawn or other newborn wildlife, enjoy your encounter, but for the animal&#8217;s well being, it is important to keep the encounter brief and maintain some distance.</p>
<p>A fawn's best chance of survival lies in being raised by its mother. Fawns nurse three to four times a day, usually for less than thirty minutes at a time, but otherwise the doe keeps her distance. This helps reduce the chances that she will attract a predator to the fawn. The fawn's protective coloration, near lack of scent and ability to remain motionless all help it avoid detection by predators and people.</p>
<p>If you find a fawn you should not approach it and by no means touch it or pick it up. The mother will most likely return to claim it. If you feel that the animal is in harms way, maintain a substantial distance while still being able to observe it and contact the <strong>campus police department 459-2231</strong> or <strong>county </strong><strong>Animal Control: <span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;">831-454-7227</span>. <br/> </strong></p>
<p>In addition to potentially harming a fawn, state and federal laws forbid possession of game and many non-game animals, so adopting newborn wildlife is usually illegal. If a fawn has been "rescued" when it shouldn't have been, it can often be released at the same location. Parents tend to remain in the area for at least a day, looking for the lost youngster.</p>
