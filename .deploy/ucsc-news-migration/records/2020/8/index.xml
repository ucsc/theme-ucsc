</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At College Nine, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s second-youngest college, a collection of international flags hangs between the residential buildings, swaying with every passing breeze.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those flags aren&#8217;t merely decorative. They also represent an unwavering statement of purpose. After all, College Nine is a place where students learn to think of themselves as citizens of the world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its close ties to the Social Sciences Division and its celebration of world cultures, College Nine instills a strong sense of altruism, cultural awareness, and service to others.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everything we do at College Nine, we do in a practical, hands-on way so students not only understand themselves and their identities, but also contextualize these in the U.S. and beyond,&#8221; said interim Senior Director for College Student Life Sarah Woodside Bury.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>A community of global citizens</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At College Nine, stunning redwood trees surround modern-looking red, yellow, and gray buildings fronting green lawns. Explore the grounds and you&#8217;ll soon come across the college&#8217;s 35 murals that extend to the campus of College Ten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expressive murals highlight global communities and social justice themes. One mural, titled, &#8220;Flowers Around the World,&#8221; depicts popular flowers in various countries. Artists Eden Ricci (College Nine '19, German studies) and Jenny Fullerton (Crown '19, computer science, computer game design) created the mural to show that every country is beautiful in its own way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">College Nine&#8217;s student body is diverse, representing a myriad of cultures. Through purposeful, student-centered programming and learning opportunities, College Nine fosters an inclusive community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the campus&#8217;s commitment to intercultural understanding is also a way of life. iFloor, a unique, first-year living environment offered in College Nine residence halls, exemplifies this philosophy. On the iFloor, U.S. and international students live together to foster a community that bridges distances and fosters cultural awareness.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I never cease to be amazed by the multifaceted and creative ways in which our international students participate and engage alongside domestic students to the enrichment of both,&#8221; said Colleges Nine and Ten Provost Flora Lu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">College Nine&#8217;s core course reinforces this strong sense of global consciousness and community focus. The class instills strong writing skills, sharpens critical thinking, and covers topics related to the college theme. It also centers student voices through </span><a href="https://slugstories.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slug Stories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a collective, archival, digital project platform showcasing thousands of undergraduate personal narratives.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students write their stories as part of the core course, bouncing ideas off each other in small groups and sharing drafts in their sections. At the end of the quarter, there is a college-wide story slam in the Multipurpose Room, open to the entire campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through this storytelling process, students share their experiences, struggles, and triumphs. They reflect on pivotal moments of change, such as arriving in the United States from another country, and the journeys that brought them to UCSC. This lively story exchange sparks dialogue between peers to further awareness, empathy, and community across different cultures.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>The interconnectedness of leadership and service&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz has a strong and valuable tradition of cross-disciplinary thinking and problem solving&#8212;exemplified by College Nine&#8217;s Co-Curricular Programs Office, known as CoCo for short.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoCo lets students dive deeply into themes shared by Colleges Nine and Ten, exploring global and social justice issues in the community and larger society, and engaging in experiential, peer-to-peer learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These opportunities include clubs, conferences, courses, and concerts, giving students plenty of chances to connect with their campus and local communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One example of how CoCo connects students across campus is through the popular campuswide, single-day event known as the Practical Activism Conference (PAC), which offers keynote presentations, special events, and activities throughout the day. The goal of the conference is to heighten awareness of social injustice and inspire activism.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another inspiring initiative put forth by the Co-Curricular Programs Office is the student-led course, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CLNI 85 Global Action. CLNI 85 </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a peer workshop dedicated to teaching about global issues and transforming knowledge into practical approaches to raise awareness and generate change.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Being a part of CoCo made my experience as a College Nine student that much more enjoyable,&#8221; said recent graduate Jordon Leung (College Nine &#8216;20, cognitive science, artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction concentration).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I felt like I belonged somewhere, a warm community was around me, and at the same time, it opened up so many new opportunities for me to further engage with campus,&#8221; Leung said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>An inspiring place to relax</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students also connect outside academic and residential life by hanging out at the popular Terry Freitas Caf&#233;, named after a remarkable young alumnus who died tragically.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freitas (Crown '97, biology, environmental studies) traveled to Colombia to work closely with the U'wa people, while organizing to stop oil drilling on U'wa lands. In 1999, armed assailants kidnapped Freitas and two colleagues. Freitas was 24 at the time of his death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freitas embodied what it was to be a global citizen and left an inspirational legacy behind. His family and friends talk about how much Freitas would have loved sitting in the caf&#233;, sipping coffee and spending time with friends. Terry Freitas Caf&#233; is a welcoming student hub offering snacks, a pool table, a piano, and open space for students to study or socialize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It almost looks like a scene out of a movie,&#8221; said Leung. &#8220;When you walk in, you are greeted by the sound of lo-fi music playing in the background and the sight of College Nine and Ten students hanging out and studying.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Leaving a lasting impression</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">College Nine is very serious about building leadership skills among its student population. In fact, students with "next level" leadership ambitions can embark on a Leadership Certificate Program that requires four years of active participation in the college community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who put the time and effort in can apply for the leadership certification, a recognition bestowed during commencement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The involvement opportunities are bountiful at College Nine. Through courses, programs, and an inclusive residential life, the college brings forth a legacy of global citizens and altruistic leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Students educate themselves, build on faculty expertise, gain organizational and leadership skills, and take action to promote positive change, embodying a global mindset,&#8221; said Lu. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bb751fc08072701763b3cba6e8510a8c"><name>covid-19-planning-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>COVID-19 Planning Update</title><summary>I write to share the latest information on the campus COVID-19 planning efforts.

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Current Situation</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The operating status of UC Santa Cruz has not changed. All operations that can be done remotely should continue to do so. Events and large gatherings are all taking place virtually. In addition, only essential business travel is being conducted. California has yet to allow higher education to resume unrestricted in-person instruction and operations. We anticipate that employees who can effectively continue working remotely will do so at least until Jan. 4, 2021.</span></p>

As stated in prior communications, most instruction will take place using a remote modality. For the small number of courses that have been approved for in-person instruction, review is underway to ensure the classrooms where these courses are assigned have appropriate physical mitigations in place. In addition, review is underway for the potential return to on-site work of other operations required to support instruction, research, and the students living on campus.

Geller, Northwestern University)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Unprecedented observations shine light on a compact star’s final moments</article-subhead><article-text><p>Half of all the calcium in the universe, including the very calcium in our teeth and bones, was created in the last gasp of dying stars. Called &#8220;calcium-rich supernovae,&#8221; these stellar explosions are so rare that astrophysicists have struggled to find and study them. As a result, the nature of these supernovae and their mechanism for creating calcium have remained elusive.</p>
<p>Now an international team has potentially uncovered the true nature of these rare, mysterious events. For the first time ever, the researchers examined a calcium-rich supernova with x-ray imaging, which provided an unprecedented glimpse into the star during the last month of its life and ultimate explosion.</p>
<p>The new findings, published August 5 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>, revealed that a calcium-rich supernova is a compact star that sheds an outer layer of gas during the final stages of its life. When the star explodes, its matter collides with the loose material in that outer shell, emitting bright x-rays. The overall explosion causes intensely hot temperatures and high pressure, driving a chemical reaction that produces calcium.</p>
<p>&#8220;These events are so few in number that we have never known what produced calcium-rich supernova,&#8221; said first author Wynn Jacobson-Galan, who began working on the study at UC Santa Cruz and is currently a graduate student at Northwestern University. &#8220;By observing what this star did in its final month before it reached its critical, tumultuous end, we peered into a place previously unexplored, opening new avenues of study within transient science.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nearly 70 co-authors from more than 15 countries contributed to the paper, including Ryan Foley, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, UCSC postdoctoral researchers Charles Kilpatrick and Georgios Dimitriadis, and UCSC graduate students Dave Coulter, C&#233;sar Rojas-Bravo, and Matt Siebert. Jacobson-Galan earned his B.S. in astrophysics at UCSC in 2018 and then worked as a junior specialist on Foley&#8217;s research team for a year before starting his graduate studies at Northwestern.</p>
<p>&#8220;This supernova was in Messier 100, a beautiful nearby spiral galaxy, so we have superb data,&#8221; Foley said. &#8220;In addition to the first x-ray detection of a supernova of this class, we had really deep pre-explosion Hubble images, and we caught it right after explosion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the most critical observations were obtained at UC&#8217;s Lick Observatory by Foley&#8217;s team during the first few days after the supernova was detected. &#8220;In the Lick spectra, we saw strong emission from ionized helium in the stellar environment that matches up with the x-ray data,&#8221; Foley said. &#8220;The combination of everything really constrains the nature of the progenitor system and how the star exploded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before this event, we had indirect information about what calcium-rich supernovae might or might not be,&#8221; added senior author Raffaella Margutti, assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Northwestern. &#8220;Now, we can confidently rule out several possibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amateur astronomer Jaroslaw Grzegorzek was the first to announce the news of a new supernova, dubbed SN 2019ehk, to the astronomical community. Amateur astronomer Joel Shepherd also spotted the bright burst while stargazing in Seattle and acquired the first image of the new source in the sky. Both astronomers had been viewing Messier 100 (M100), a spiral galaxy located 55 million light years from Earth, and noticed that a bright orange dot appeared in the frame.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as the world knew that there was a potential supernova in M100, a global collaboration was ignited,&#8221; Jacobson-Galan said. &#8220;Every single country with a prominent telescope turned to look at this object.&#8221;</p>
<p>This included leading observatories in the United States such as NASA&#8217;s Swift Satellite, W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, and Lick Observatory. The UCSC team obtained data from Lick&#8217;s 3-meter Shane Telescope, the 10-meter Keck I Telescope, and the 1-meter Swope Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. The also worked closely with the Thacher School, a high school in Ojai, California, to use their 0.7-meter telescope to make observations.</p>
<p>UC Santa Barbara graduate student Daichi Hiramatsu was the first to trigger Swift to study SN 2019ehk in the X-ray and ultraviolet. Hiramatsu also is a staff scientist at Las Cumbres Observatory, which played a crucial role in monitoring the long-term evolution of this supernova with its global telescope network.</p>
<p>The worldwide follow-up operation moved so quickly that the supernova was observed just 10 hours after explosion. The x-ray emission detected with Swift only lingered for five days and then completely disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the world of transients, we have to discover things very, very fast before they fade,&#8221; Margutti said. &#8220;Initially, no one was looking for x-rays. Daichi noticed something and alerted us to the strange appearance of what looked like x-rays. We looked at the images and realized something was there. It was much more luminous than anybody would have ever thought. There were no preexisting theories that predicted calcium-rich transients would be so luminous in x-ray wavelengths.&#8221;</p>
<p>While all calcium comes from stars, calcium-rich supernovae pack the most powerful punch. Typical stars create small amounts of calcium slowly through burning helium throughout their lives. Calcium-rich supernovae, on the other hand, produce massive amounts of calcium within seconds.</p>
<p>&#8220;The explosion is trying to cool down,&#8221; Margutti explained. &#8220;It wants to give away its energy, and calcium emission is an efficient way to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using Keck, the Northwestern team discovered that SN 2019ehk emitted the most calcium ever observed in a singular astrophysical event. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t just calcium rich,&#8221; Margutti said. &#8220;It was the richest of the rich.&#8221;</p>
<p>SN 2019ehk&#8217;s brief luminosity told another a story about its nature. The researchers believe that the star shed an outer layer of gas in its final days. When the star exploded, its material collided with this outer layer to produce a bright, energetic burst of x-rays.</p>
<p>&#8220;The luminosity tells us how much material the star shed and how close that material was to the star,&#8221; Jacobson-Galan said. &#8220;In this case, the star lost a very small amount of material right before it exploded. That material was still nearby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the Hubble Space Telescope had been observing M100 for the past 25 years, the powerful telescope never registered the star responsible for SN 2019ehk, which was experiencing its final evolution. UCSC&#8217;s Kilpatrick analyzed the supernova site in the Hubble images taken before the explosion occurred, providing yet another clue to the star&#8217;s true nature.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Hubble data from before the explosion are incredibly deep, so we would have seen any type of star at the site of the supernova unless it was almost as small as the sun or something even smaller, like a white dwarf,&#8221; Kilpatrick said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without this explosion, you wouldn&#8217;t know that anything was ever there,&#8221; Margutti added. &#8220;Not even Hubble could see it.&#8221;</p>

He was 84 and had been in hospice care for several months after undergoing treatment for cancer and suffering a stroke.</p>
<p>A leading authority on marine invertebrates and intertidal ecology, Pearse was a beloved teacher and mentor to generations of marine biologists. He pioneered long-term studies of kelp forests and intertidal ecosystems on California&#8217;s Central Coast, was instrumental in establishing the marine science program at UC Santa Cruz, wrote and edited major textbooks and reference books in his field, and led several scientific organizations.</p>
<p>His most enduring legacy, however, is likely to be the many students he inspired, mentored, and helped launch on successful careers in science.</p>
<p>&#8220;John&#8217;s ability to draw in students, to convey the pure excitement of basic research, was unparalleled,&#8221; said James McClintock, who worked with Pearse as a UCSC undergraduate and later as a postdoctoral fellow, and is now an endowed professor of polar and marine biology at the University of Alabama, Birmingham.</p>
<p>&#8220;I entered UCSC as an English major, and because of John I exited as a marine invertebrate zoologist headed off to a successful career,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have to think he is among the very best of the best teachers UCSC has had the good fortune to employ.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daniel Costa, director of UCSC&#8217;s Institute of Marine Sciences, said Pearse combined teaching and research in his courses on intertidal biology and kelp forest ecology.</p>
<p>&#8220;He taught students the science of marine ecology as they helped him collect data on marine organisms,&#8221; Costa said. &#8220;He was an extremely knowledgeable natural historian and a superb experimentalist. Students and faculty alike would follow him around while he worked, discussing biology, politics, and humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Born in Boise, Idaho, Pearse attended high school in Tucson, Arizona, obtained his B.S. in zoology at the University of Chicago, and earned a Ph.D. in biology at Stanford University. He taught at the American University in Cairo, Egypt, and studied invertebrates in the Red Sea, but had to leave abruptly when the 1967 Six-Day War erupted. After four years as a researcher at the California Institute of Technology, he joined the biology faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 1971.</p>
<p>After his retirement in 1994, Pearse continued to teach and conduct research as a professor emeritus. In 2000, he founded an educational program for high school students, initially run by UCSC&#8217;s Seymour Marine Discovery Center, to teach students about the intertidal zone and continue the monitoring of coastal ecosystems he had begun in the 1970s. Eventually, the program grew to become a statewide citizen science program, the <a href="https://limpets.org/">Long-Term Monitoring Program and Experimental Training for Students (LiMPETS)</a>, monitoring the coastal ecosystems of California&#8217;s national marine sanctuaries.</p>
<p>Although Pearse&#8217;s research focused mostly on the California coast, his studies ranged from Antarctica to Japan. He was among the first biologists to work at McMurdo Station, overwintering in the Antarctic in 1961 and studying reproduction in the Antarctic sea star. Pearse Valley, an ice-free valley near McMurdo Sound, was named in recognition of his early contributions to Antarctic science.</p>
<p>Pearse&#8217;s wife Vicki Buchsbaum Pearse also studied marine invertebrates and was a research associate at the Institute of Marine Sciences. They were both honored in 2008 with a lifetime achievement award from the Western Society of Naturalists. Together with Vicki's parents, Ralph and Mildred Buchsbaum, they revised the classic invertebrate zoology textbook <em>Animals Without Backbones</em> and wrote another, <em>Living Invertebrates</em>, first published in 1987. They also coedited the seven-volume treatise <em>Reproduction of Marine Invertebrates</em>.</p>
<p>Pearse served as president of the California Academy of Sciences, the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology, the Western Society of Naturalists, and the International Society of Invertebrate Reproduction and Development. He received the California Academy of Sciences Fellows' Medal, its highest honor, in 2011.</p>
<p>Pearse is survived by his brother Spencer, wife Vicki, son Devon, daughter-in-law Louise, and granddaughter Fiona.

class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Titled &#8220;Animacy and Resumption at the Border of Cognition and Grammar,&#8221; the grant will help them bring together all the strands of work they have been doing with the Zapotec community in California and in Mexico&#8212;including the creation of community partnerships, fieldwork, and research opportunities for undergraduate students in Oaxaca.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The project builds on our long-term engagement with the large community of indigenous Oaxacans now living in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties,&#8221; said principal investigator Toosarvandani.</span></p>
<p><span> &#8220;In recent years, linguists at UC Santa Cruz have been learning about the endangered languages these immigrants have brought with them (Zapotec, Mixtec, and Chatino), as well as finding ways to make this knowledge useful to the community through our Nido de Lenguas initiative with the local non-profit organization Senderos.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The grant will support our linguists as we work with speakers of Oaxacan languages here in California and in Oaxaca, providing unique research opportunities for UCSC undergraduates,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We will be investigating a fundamental aspect of cognition: how language users refer to the world around them through their system of pronouns, and how this system is shaped by animacy&#8212;how much something is conceived of as alive or human.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Toosarvandani noted that the grant will also support a comparison between Zapotec, a language that has not been studied much by linguists, and Modern Hebrew, a language that is much better understood.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The two languages seem to have some unusual similarities in their pronoun systems, but they represent animacy in vastly different ways,&#8221; said Toosarvandani. &#8220;Zapotec has dedicated pronouns for elder and younger humans, animals, and things, while Hebrew has a more restricted system (though even with these limited resources, it is sensitive to animacy). By conducting parallel studies in both languages, we will develop a better understanding of how animacy is represented in language and, more generally, in human cognition.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Bringing together two syntacticians with interests in Hebrew (Sichel) and Zapotec (Toosarvandani), and a psycholinguist (Wagers), this cross-disciplinary project addresses a discrepancy between theories of grammatical competence and recent findings in language processing and experimental linguistics.</span></p>
<p><span>Results from the research and background fieldwork will add to the development of language materials in the ongoing collaboration between the Linguistics Department and the Santa Cruz non-profit organization, Senderos, and will also be shared at monthly language classes, local cultural festivals, and regular workshops to introduce the public to the indigenous languages of Oaxaca.</span></p>
<p><span>Toosarvandani added that UCSC&#8217;s<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span>Humanities Institute (THI)</span><span> has provided critical support for the linguists, providing seed funding and planning support for new programs, and coordinating funding and logistics for a research fieldwork trip in Oaxaca last year with students.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;THI&#8217;s investments at these critical stages have made all the difference, laying the foundation for this NSF grant and the project&#8217;s future success,&#8221; he noted. &#8220;It is hard to imagine how we could have done it without THI."</span></p>

<p>Through an $805,000 purchase of additional laboratory equipment for the UCSC Molecular Diagnostic Lab, local testing capacity should increase to 600-800 tests per day once fully operational. The partnership will help address increased transmission in the community, and make Santa Cruz County more self-sufficient in its response through increased testing capacity and more rapid diagnosis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Addressing COVID-19 in the community demands that we rely on the strength of our partnerships, and this partnership will form the backbone of our response efforts when it comes to testing and diagnosis,&#8221; Santa Cruz County Health Services Director Mimi Hall said. &#8220;We are thankful to have UC Santa Cruz in our community and to see them rise to meet the challenges before us.&#8221;</p>
<p>A growing number of health organizations in the Santa Cruz area have begun turning to the UCSC Molecular Diagnostic Lab to provide testing for coronavirus infections. So far, the lab has been able to meet the demand for tests and continues to return results within 24 to 48 hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are grateful to the county for these funds, which will help ensure that our diagnostic lab continues to be able to meet the increasing needs of the community and campus for coronavirus testing,&#8221; said Scott Brandt, vice chancellor for research at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In order to ensure seamless continuity with lab activities, it will take several weeks to integrate and test new equipment after it arrives. Ramping up to the new target for testing capacity must be done gradually and is likely to take several months.</p>
<p>The new equipment should allow for expanded testing by local providers, including additional contact tracing of asymptomatic patients. It includes two new robotic liquid handling platforms, a new PCR system, and a number of smaller items for the first stage in the process of ramping up the lab&#8217;s testing capacity.</p>
<p>Testing to identify people infected with the coronavirus is crucial for controlling the pandemic. A surge in cases and shortages of some of the reagents needed for tests have strained the capacity of testing sites throughout the country, including commercial diagnostic laboratories, leading to delays in the reporting of test results.</p>
<p>The UCSC lab does not use the same suppliers as commercial labs and has not yet experienced any shortages of supplies or reagents.</p>
<p>The lab is currently partnering with the UCSC Student Health Center to provide testing for UCSC students and essential campus personnel and with Salud Para la Gente and Santa Cruz Community Health to provide testing for the area&#8217;s low-income and vulnerable residents. In addition, the lab is partnering with Santa Cruz County Public Health and the Santa Cruz Community Foundation to provide testing for various local community medical providers and public service entities on a short term, immediate basis, to address emergency needs. UCSC is in the process of finalizing agreements with other local providers to expand testing capacity in support of the county&#8217;s needs.</p>
<p>The UCSC lab tests samples sent to the lab from medical providers to determine if a patient is infected and does not treat patients or collect samples from patients directly. County residents should not contact UCSC to request testing and should work through local medical providers.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ca220df88072701763b3cba6f66244be"><name>ocean-explorers-summer-camp</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Going with the flow—famed Ocean Explorers Summer Camp heads online</title><summary>COVID-19 compelled the Seymour Marine Discovery Center to take its popular Ocean Explorers Summer Camp virtual after running the program in person for 21 years—a successful experiment that presented both challenges and opportunities.&#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kojima, age 10, was one of 100 youth who attended a first-of-its-kind virtual summer camp offering from UC Santa Cruz's Seymour Marine Discovery Center.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 1999, the Seymour Center has delivered the highly respected and popular </span><a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/learn/youth-teen-programs/ocean-explorers-summer-camp/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocean Explorers Summer Camp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;an in-person day camp offering different week-long marine science educational programs to children ages 7 to 14.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the COVID-19 pandemic upending most in-person summer camps, however, the Seymour Center&#8212;with an already full registration list for the in-person program by spring of this year&#8212;had to quickly adapt their long-standing camp to a distance-learning format through Zoom software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In anticipation of the remote format, Katrina London (Rachel Carson '97, marine biology), youth programs assistant manager at the Seymour Center, wanted to ensure that the content was going to be just as engaging as it was in person, and there would be ample opportunities for students to build connections with their peers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My motto as I was creating the content and preparing to deliver it online was &#8216;connection before content&#8217; to build a sense of community for students,&#8221; said London.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was crucial to add that level of personal connection through a variety of games and activities before diving into the content of the camp to ease into a distance-learning format and keep participants actively engaged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ocean Explorers Camp, which began programming the week of June 22 and concluded on August 7, successfully delivered week-long sessions, fully online for the first time since the program started.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From interactive learning activities to up-close and personal marine animal virtual visits, students immersed themselves into the world of marine science discovery and interacted with instructors, marine scientists, and animal trainers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Virtual programs offered</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The center had three summer camp offerings: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something&#8217;s Fishy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marine Science for Girls</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masterful Marine Mammals</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And just like what happens each year for the in-person programming, every session ended up reaching registration capacity, with more than half of the original in-person camp registrants retained in the virtual camp.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Something&#8217;s Fishy </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">program, for ages 7 to 9, transformed children into fish scientists for the week, where they learned about different species of fish, their adaptations, and their habitats. Instructors presented behind-the-scenes footage of the Seymour Center, with live streaming of the center&#8217;s aquarium.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marine Science for Girls </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">program, for ages 9&#8211;11, and the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masterful Marine Mammals </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">program, for age groups 9&#8211;11 and 12&#8211;14, partnered with two research labs based out of the world-renowned UC Santa Cruz Long Marine Laboratory, the </span><a href="https://www.mmpp.ucsc.edu/Marine_Mammal_Physiology_Project/Home.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marine Mammal Physiology Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://pinnipedlab.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinniped Cognition and Sensory Systems Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to deliver live streaming with marine science researchers and their work with the resident marine mammals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The live streaming sessions at the labs included screen time with some special guests: two bottlenose dolphins, a Hawaiian monk seal, a harbor seal, a bearded seal, a ringed seal, and a California sea lion.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the highlights of being virtual was that participants were able to get even closer to the animals via camera and interact with them in ways that wouldn&#8217;t have been possible with a large in-person group,&#8221; said Kevin Keedy (Crown '89, biology; M.A. '95, education), Seymour Marine Discovery Center youth programs manager.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keedy noted that a main objective of both marine programs was for participants to see what the process is like to conduct mammal research.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the interactive activities with the researchers and marine mammals, students also embarked on virtual field trips to research sites, one being the famous </span><a href="https://anonuevoreserve.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A&#241;o Nuevo Reserve</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where they interacted with Reserve Director Patrick Robinson (Rachel Carson '03, marine biology; Ph.D. '09, ecology and evolutionary biology) and observed the myriad of elephant seals, California sea lions, and Steller sea lions inhabiting the island and mainland.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>A personal experience</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kojima, a first-time participant in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masterful Marine Mammals</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 9&#8211;11 age group session, joined the week-long camp via iPad in her family&#8217;s South Lake Tahoe home.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When being interviewed on the phone with her mom Caroline, Kojima recounted the captivating content that was delivered in her session and named a couple of her favorite activities during the week.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She really enjoyed studying the bottlenose dolphins and learning how their physiology differs from ours.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We compared our human resting breathing rates and active breathing rates after different intervals of exercise to the resting and active breathing rates of dolphins,&#8221; said Kojima.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We also took a virtual visit to A&#241;o Nuevo, where we got to see the northern elephant seals up close with researcher Patrick. We learned how each colony of elephant seals has a different colored tag so that researchers can track their movements and know which colony they belong to,&#8221; declared Kojima.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A&#241;o Nuevo Reserve acts as a main breeding colony for northern elephant seals and an important research site for marine scientists.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Diverse participation&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The in-person Ocean Explorers Camp generally reaches a broad audience, with students attending from out of state and sometimes even internationally; however, this year, the program was able to garner an even more diverse audience. Out of 100 total participants, 17 zoomed from out of state, and there were even a couple from out of the country&#8212;one from Ecuador and one from Costa Rica.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Students who normally wouldn&#8217;t have been able to join the camp were able to this year due to the online format, which creates a silver lining of going virtual,&#8221; said London.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about plans for next summer, London stated that they are brainstorming ways to incorporate a hybrid model so they can offer both in-person and virtual sessions, as long as it&#8217;s safe to resume in-person camps and there are enough "hands on deck."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the greatest outcomes of the Ocean Explorers Virtual Camp being a success is seeing all the potential for new opportunities to arise,&#8221; said Keedy. &#8220;In addition to looking at a hybrid approach for our future summer camps, we are also beginning to brainstorm ideas of offering after-school programs and additional camps throughout the year.&#8221;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The executive order is an important proactive measure to help protect members of the UC community &#8212; and the public at large &#8212; and to ameliorate the severe burdens on health care systems anticipated during the coming fall and winter from influenza and COVID-19 illnesses.&#160;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">In addition to protecting those on campuses and the surrounding communities, this requirement is designed to avoid a surge of flu cases at health care facilities across the state during the unprecedented public health crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.&#160;</span></span></p>

Last week, representatives from University of California Office of the President, UC Santa Cruz, and UAW 2865 worked with a mediator to negotiate an agreement to allow for eligibility for re-employment of academic student employees who were dismissed for their failure to submit grades during the 2019-20 academic year.&#160;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Termination is an outcome in the disciplinary process outlined in the UAW 2865 contract. There is no debate that those who were terminated violated their contract by withholding grades. These terminations were not unfair or unexpected as ample notice was provided and opportunities to submit grades were offered right up to the deadline &#8212; a deadline long after grades were due. UCSC continued to pay for the health insurance of those who were dismissed from their appointments for violating their contract. Only once all grades were turned in and the wildcat strike ended were we able to explore pathways to eligibility for employment with UCOP and UAW 2865.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">UC Santa Cruz graduate students play a critical role in advancing research, supporting teaching and learning, and serving society through their work in pursuit of an advanced degree. Our graduate students are not just the future of academic research and teaching, they are a vital part of its present. We remain resolute in our commitment to find new ways to support the success of our graduate students while they study at UC Santa Cruz. This requires honest and open dialogue on the issues within our control where we can take concrete action. Improving graduate education is a continuous process and takes consistent engagement and effort by our whole community.&#160;</span></span></p>

<p>Fairlie&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27309.pdf">research found that the number of active African-American-owned businesses dropped 41 percent</a> in April, while Latinx business owners fell by 32 percent and Asian business owners dropped by 26 percent. That report was <a href="https://www.sbc.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?id=999CE328-3738-40FC-A4C0-2F8760F8E59A">cited in a bill</a> supported by Senators Kamala Harris, Chuck Shumer, Cory Booker and others to expand the Minority Business Development Agency.</p>
<p>His work has received widespread media coverage, turning up in the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, PBS, CBS, BBC and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s overwhelming,&#8221; Fairlie said about the coverage. &#8220;I&#8217;m getting one or two emails every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the attention has become so intense that it is difficult for him to keep up with his current research, including an investigation he is doing on unemployment.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Fairlie has done research about racial inequities in business. He has been interested in the issue since his dissertation and co-wrote the book <em>&#8220;Race and Entrepreneurial Success: Black-, Asian- and White-Owned Businesses in the United States.&#8221;</em> He has testified in front of Congress three times about this topic, and he has often presented his work to groups trying to promote minority causes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the nerd in the background crunching the numbers and trying to find out what&#8217;s actually happening,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>When the COVID&#8211;19 pandemic hit, he knew he needed to shift his research to the economic impact of that crisis. He knew it was critically important to find out what was happening to businesses by race and get that information released quickly. Because of his experience on the issue, he was able to access the right data sets and analyze them faster than others.</p>
<p>His research has been appreciated by the Buy Black movement, which urges black people to buy from black-owned businesses. &#8220;I felt some of this work made a difference or hopefully will,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At least it&#8217;s in the discussion.&#8221;</p>
<p>For his next project, he plans to get micro data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on unemployment and directly analyze it himself. He was hoping to analyze the data on the 5.5 million recipients of the Paycheck Protection Program loans but was disappointed to learn that the federal government did not collect information on race. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of suspicion that minority businesses were way under-represented in terms of these loans,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he, like everyone else, is dealing with the new reality of working from home. He does Zoom calls with major media out of his laundry room with his washing machine sitting right there in the background. But he said that in some way the situation creates some equality since no one is working from a fancy office. At the end of the day, he knows it&#8217;s a small inconvenience.</p>
<p>&#8220;My distractions are nothing compared to the problems other people are fighting,&#8221; he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dfa791cd8072701763b3cba67d82ea8c"><name>census-selfie</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Selfie contest supports the 2020 Census</title><summary>To generate more awareness on the importance of completing the census form, campus has launched the first-ever Slugs for Census Selfie Contest.</summary><start-date>1597129200000</start-date><display-name>Census selfies</display-name><path>/2020/08/census-selfie</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/08/census-selfie</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1597185167792</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1597185167792</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/08/images/selfies-census-250px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/08/images/selfies-census-250px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>selfies-census-250px.jpg</name><display-name>selfies-census-250px.jpg</display-name><file-size>58495</file-size><width>250</width><height>150</height></image><image-alt>Census selfies with Banana Slug</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s vital that everyone in our campus community is counted as part of the 2020 Census. Here&#8217;s why:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responses help determine federal funding to UC Santa Cruz including Pell Grants, health services and certain programs in the sciences.&#160;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the greater community, the results guide annual spending by the government on hospitals, schools, emergency services, roads, wildlife protection, the arts, and much more.&#160;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>To generate more awareness on the importance of completing the census form, campus has launched the first-ever Slugs for Census Selfie Contest.</strong> Banana Slugs who show their support for the 2020 Census, selfie-style, will have a chance to win one of five $50 Bookshop Santa Cruz Gift Cards. Here&#8217;s how to enter:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snap a selfie showing your support for the 2020 Census and share it on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter using the #SlugsForCensus hashtag.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entries will be accepted through Aug. 24.&#160;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five winners will be randomly selected.&#160;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complete contest details can be found </span><a href="https://bit.ly/2EWwjxW"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deadline for filling out the Census is Sept. 30. Get started by visiting </span><a href="http://www.my2020census.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.my2020census.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With only nine questions, it takes less than 10 minutes to complete.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, when it asks for your place of residence, use the address you were living at in Santa Cruz before you left due to COVID-19. It is where you live the majority of the year, even if you aren&#8217;t living here right now due to the pandemic.

innovative program to address underrepresentation of minorities in biomedical faculty</article-subhead><article-text><p>The <a href="https://stemcell.soe.ucsc.edu/">Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells</a> at UC Santa Cruz has received a $4.2 million grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to launch an innovative postdoctoral training and mentorship program in partnership with California State University at Monterey Bay (CSUMB).</p>
<p>The new program will provide support for postdoctoral researchers studying stem cell biology at UCSC, combined with the opportunity for them to develop critical teaching and mentoring skills while working with undergraduates at CSUMB. The funding comes from the Institutional Research and Academic Career Development Award (IRACDA) Program at NIH, which aims to develop a diverse pool of well-trained biomedical scientists who have the necessary knowledge and skills to pursue independent academic teaching and research careers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is much more than traditional postdoctoral training, in which people often end up feeling somewhat isolated in their labs,&#8221; said Camilla Forsberg, professor of biomolecular engineering at UCSC and one of the program&#8217;s principal investigators. &#8220;The postdocs will get to train together as part of a cohort, and they will get teaching training, career development, and more structured mentoring.&#8221;</p>
<p>The program will provide four years of support for postdoctoral scholars. Principal investigator Aparna Sreenivasan, an associate professor of genetics and molecular biology at CSUMB, explained that, after their first year, the scholars will spend 25 percent of their time teaching at CSUMB, where they will work closely with a faculty mentor.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will give them a huge edge over other postdocs when they are applying for faculty positions, and they will know what it&#8217;s like to teach at a predominantly undergraduate institution like CSUMB,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have a large number of students from underrepresented groups, and when we are recruiting faculty, we are looking for people with teaching experience who understand pedagogical methods and know how to interact with undergraduates.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both UCSC and CSUMB are Hispanic Serving Institutions with many students from historically under-served backgrounds. The IRACDA program takes a two-pronged approach to address the underrepresentation of minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research, by preparing a diverse group of postdoctoral scholars to succeed in academic careers and by providing additional mentorship, role models, and opportunities for underrepresented minority students in STEM.</p>
<p>&#8220;We aim to build a diverse cohort of postdocs, and we&#8217;re very excited about the partnership with CSUMB and the opportunity to create a vibrant, mutually advantageous exchange between the two institutions,&#8221; said principal investigator Lindsay Hinck, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>UCSC and CSUMB have a long-standing relationship and ongoing collaborations in various programs. An informal program providing UCSC postdoctoral fellows with teaching mentoring at CSUMB has already shown success, with participants going on to land full-time faculty positions.</p>
<p>Sreenivasan said she hopes to leverage the IRACDA program to help build the pipeline for underrepresented students in STEM fields. &#8220;We want to increase the numbers of CSUMB students feeding into the graduate programs at UCSC,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells, established in 2005 with funding from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, has built a cohesive interdisciplinary stem cell research community at UCSC. It brings together 23 laboratories led by faculty from five different departments and two divisions. Hinck and Forsberg are co-directors of the institute, which provides a strong research and administrative infrastructure for running the IRACDA training program.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am looking forward to working with the postdocs who will be coming in,&#8221; Forsberg said. &#8220;The program will attract people who are really interested in getting faculty positions.

<p><span>The $60,000 grant is one of 25 new Public Scholar awards to support popular nonfiction books in the humanities that are part of a larger slate of 238 grants just announced by the NEH.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&#8220;</strong>These challenging times&#160;underscore&#160;how important the humanities are to&#160;making&#160;American culture and world&#160;history relatable across generations,&#8221;&#160;noted NEH Chairman Jon Parrish Peede. &#8220;NEH is proud to award&#160;hundreds of&#160;grants to keep&#160;our&#160;nation&#8217;s scholars, students, teachers, and citizens moving forward in pursuit of new knowledge and understanding.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>O&#8217;Malley said that the book,<i>The Escapes of David George: An Odyssey of Slavery and Freedom in the Revolutionary Era</i><strong>, </strong>will explore vital questions about the place of slavery in early America, the lines of inclusion and exclusion that marked the American Revolution, and the scale of oppression that people of African descent endured and resisted in both slavery and freedom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Offering a window into early American society, the story of David George will provide a counterpoint to the multitude of biographies on early America&#8217;s white political leaders. Instead of the typical narratives about political freedom from Great Britain and monarchy, George&#8217;s life presents a parallel quest for freedom from American slavery and racism.</span></p>
<p><span>O&#8217;Malley is the author of <i>Final Passages: The Intercolonial Slave Trade of British America, 1619-1807</i>, a 2015 book that has won multiple awards for helping to redraw the map of the forced African migration during the slave trade era.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>He explained why he decided to take on this new project.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;In my prior research on the slave trade, one thing I found endlessly troubling was the impersonal nature of the surviving sources,&#8221; said O&#8217;Malley. &#8220;I could find lots of information about slave trading ventures in port records, merchants&#8217; correspondence, and government reports, but virtually no sources survive from enslaved people themselves. The whole time I wrote, I was haunted by my limited ability to access the perspectives of the people most affected by the history I was studying.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;For a second project, I was eager to find a way to study slavery in early American from a more personal perspective. David George&#8217;s story offers that. We have quite a few surviving narratives from enslaved people in later time periods&#8212;the decades leading up to the Civil War&#8212;but very few from the colonial or revolutionary eras. David George&#8217;s oral account of his life, transcribed by Baptist ministers, is brief, but it&#8217;s so rare that I think it&#8217;s crucial to research every detail to try to piece together a fuller picture of his story.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Salmon are critically important to both people and ecosystems in Alaska, supporting commercial and subsistence fisheries and transporting nutrients from the ocean to inland areas, fertilizing the ecosystems in and around the rivers where they spawn. Smaller salmon provide less food for people who depend on them, less value for commercial fishers, and less fertilizer for terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
<p>For years, people in Alaska have been noticing that wild salmon were getting smaller, but the reasons have been unclear. In the new study, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17726-z">published August 19 in <em>Nature Communications</em></a>, researchers compiled and analyzed data collected over six decades (1957 to 2018) from 12.5 million fish by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. This unprecedented dataset enabled them to see patterns of body size changes for four species of salmon&#8212;Chinook, chum, coho, and sockeye&#8212;across all regions of Alaska.</p>
<p>The results showed that the decreases in body size are primarily due to salmon returning to their spawning grounds at younger ages than they have in the past. Alaskan salmon can spend up to seven years at sea, although this varies by species. During this time they feed and grow to maturity, migrating great distances in the North Pacific Ocean before returning to fresh water to spawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two ways they could be getting smaller&#8212;they could be growing less and be the same age but smaller, or they could be younger&#8212;and we saw a strong and consistent pattern that the salmon are returning to the rivers younger than they did historically,&#8221; said corresponding author Eric Palkovacs, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and associate director of the Fisheries Collaborative Program in the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>No smoking gun</strong></p>
<p>The researchers identified a range of factors that appear to be driving this shift, some acting across all regions and others affecting only certain species or populations.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not a single smoking gun,&#8221; said first author Krista Oke, a postdoctoral scientist initially at UC Santa Cruz and now at University of Alaska Fairbanks. &#8220;Small contributions from a lot of factors are adding up to drive these changes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two factors&#8212;climate change and competition with growing numbers of wild and hatchery salmon in the ocean&#8212;have clearly contributed to size declines across all species and regions, Palkovacs said. In contrast, the effect of commercial fishing appears to be important only for some salmon populations. Similarly, the results were mixed for another proposed driver of size declines, the recovering populations of marine mammals that prey on salmon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that climate drives changes in ocean productivity, and we see a consistent signal of climate factors associated with decreasing salmon size,&#8221; Palkovacs said. &#8220;Another consistent association is with the abundance of salmon in the ocean, especially pink salmon. Their abundance in the North Pacific is at historic highs due in part to hatchery production in Alaska and Asia, and they compete with other salmon for food.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Increasing risk</strong></p>
<p>The observation that salmon are returning to freshwater streams at younger ages implies that the ocean is becoming a riskier place for them to be, he said. By staying in the ocean longer and growing larger, salmon can have greater success in spawning and lay more eggs, but each additional year increases the risk of not returning to reproduce at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Natural selection has always pushed in both directions, but the balance between the two is changing, pushing harder against the older, larger salmon,&#8221; Palkovacs said. &#8220;It seems that the ocean is becoming a riskier place to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Oke, understanding exactly what is going on in the ocean to drive this shift is a difficult challenge that will require further study. &#8220;That&#8217;s the next hard step I hope we can get to soon,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It could be that they&#8217;re having to spend more time feeding, which is putting them in risky places. Lots of things could be happening to increase the overall risk of mortality in the ocean, but we weren&#8217;t able to pin that down.&#8221;</p>
<p>The consequences for people and ecosystems, however, are more clear. Smaller salmon means fewer meals per fish for subsistence fishers, lower profits for commercial fishers, fewer eggs laid to sustain salmon populations, and fewer nutrients to support the productivity and biodiversity of freshwater and riparian ecosystems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Smaller fish is a real problem for people who depend on salmon for their food and well being,&#8221; Oke said. &#8220;For commercial fishers, smaller fish tend to fetch lower prices, and below a certain size they can&#8217;t be made into high-value products and might have to be canned.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Nutrient delivery</strong></p>
<p>On the ecosystem side, the nutrients delivered by salmon runs provide critical support for bears, insects, birds, trees, and juvenile salmon themselves. Palkovacs noted that an extensive body of research has tracked the movement of marine nitrogen from salmon into the terrestrial ecosystems around the streams where they spawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Salmon go up into these small streams, and whether they are caught by predators or die after spawning, their nutrients are transferred into the forests and freshwater ecosystems,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a classic salmon ecosystem service, and the amount of nutrients they deliver depends on their body size.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study had its origins in a working group organized by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at UC Santa Barbara through its <a href="https://alaskasalmonandpeople.org/">State of Alaska&#8217;s Salmon and People</a> project. With funding from the Gordon &amp; Betty Moore Foundation, the researchers were able to work with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to compile data the agency had been collecting for decades, but which was dispersed among different field offices in various smaller databases.</p>
<p>&#8220;At NCEAS, we had two data scientists who compiled all the data into one massive database on Alaskan salmon that is now publicly available,&#8221; Palkovacs said. &#8220;It took a lot of time and energy, but that&#8217;s what enabled us to do this comprehensive analysis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oke added that getting the data in the first place was no small task either. &#8220;When you think about the fact that we used data from 12.5 million salmon, that&#8217;s how many times someone from ADF&amp;G measured a salmon. It&#8217;s an exceptional amount of work to make a dataset like this possible,&#8221; she said.</p>

In other directions, x-rays are reprocessed by the photosphere or wind, powering the ultraviolet and optical emissions. Hydrogen emission is produced at two distinct sites outside of the photosphere: a large elliptical disk (color-coded by velocity to show rotation) joined by the fallback material, and a broad emission line region (BLR) that is likely created by a radiation-driven wind (purple shaded area). <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/08/images/tde-disk-schematic-800.jpg"><strong>See larger image</strong></a>.

Astronomers study the light from these &#8220;tidal disruption events&#8221; (TDEs) for clues to the feeding behavior of the supermassive black holes lurking at the centers of galaxies.</p>
<p>New TDE observations led by astronomers at UC Santa Cruz now provide clear evidence that debris from the star forms a rotating disk, called an accretion disk, around the black hole. Theorists have been debating whether an accretion disk can form efficiently during a tidal disruption event, and the new findings, accepted for publication in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09427">available online</a>, should help resolve that question, said first author Tiara Hung, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;In classical theory, the TDE flare is powered by an accretion disk, producing x-rays from the inner region where hot gas spirals into the black hole,&#8221; Hung said. &#8220;But for most TDEs, we don&#8217;t see x-rays&#8212;they mostly shine in the ultraviolet and optical wavelengths&#8212;so it was suggested that, instead of a disk, we&#8217;re seeing emissions from the collision of stellar debris streams.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coauthors Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, and Jane Dai at the University of Hong Kong developed a theoretical model, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/05/tde-model.html"><span>published in 2018</span></a>, that can explain why x-rays are usually not observed in TDEs despite the formation of an accretion disk. The new observations provide strong support for this model.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first solid confirmation that accretion disks form in these events, even when we don&#8217;t see x-rays,&#8221; Ramirez-Ruiz said. &#8220;The region close to the black hole is obscured by an optically thick wind, so we don&#8217;t see the x-ray emissions, but we do see optical light from an extended elliptical disk.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Telltale evidence</strong></p>
<p>The telltale evidence for an accretion disk comes from spectroscopic observations. Coauthor Ryan Foley, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, and his team began monitoring the TDE (named AT 2018hyz) after it was first detected in November 2018 by the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN). Foley noticed an unusual spectrum while observing the TDE with the 3-meter Shane Telescope at UC&#8217;s Lick Observatory on the night of January 1, 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;My jaw dropped, and I immediately knew this was going to be interesting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What stood out was the hydrogen line&#8212;the emission from hydrogen gas&#8212;which had a double-peaked profile that was unlike any other TDE we&#8217;d seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Foley explained that the double peak in the spectrum results from the Doppler effect, which shifts the frequency of light emitted by a moving object. In an accretion disk spiraling around a black hole and viewed at an angle, some of the material will be moving toward the observer, so the light it emits will be shifted to a higher frequency, and some of the material will be moving away from the observer, its light shifted to a lower frequency.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same effect that causes the sound of a car on a race track to shift from a high pitch as the car comes toward you to a lower pitch when it passes and starts moving away from you,&#8221; Foley said. &#8220;If you&#8217;re sitting in the bleachers, the cars on one turn are all moving toward you and the cars on the other turn are moving away from you. In an accretion disk, the gas is moving around the black hole in a similar way, and that&#8217;s what gives the two peaks in the spectrum.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team continued to gather data over the next few months, observing the TDE with several telescopes as it evolved over time. Hung led a detailed analysis of the data, which indicates that disk formation took place relatively quickly, in a matter of weeks after the disruption of the star. The findings suggest that disk formation may be common among optically detected TDEs despite the rarity of double-peaked emission, which depends on factors such as the inclination of the disk relative to observers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we got lucky with this one,&#8221; Ramirez-Ruiz said. &#8220;Our simulations show that what we observe is very sensitive to the inclination. There is a preferred orientation to see these double-peak features, and a different orientation to see x-ray emissions.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that Hung&#8217;s analysis of multi-wavelength follow-up observations, including photometric and spectroscopic data, provides unprecedented insights into these unusual events. &#8220;When we have spectra, we can learn a lot about the kinematics of the gas and get a much clearer understanding of the accretion process and what is powering the emissions,&#8221; Ramirez-Ruiz said.</p>
<p>In addition to Hung, Foley, Ramirez-Ruiz, and other members of the UCSC team, the coauthors of the paper also include scientists at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen (where Ramirez-Ruiz holds a Niels Bohr Professorship); University of Hong Kong; University of Melbourne, Australia; Carnegie Institution for Science; and Space Telescope Science Institute.</p>

<p dir="ltr">If our main campus loses power, some buildings would remain online, powered by our cogeneration plant. Some of the buildings not on the cogeneration-plant feed have backup generators in place to supply emergency lighting. Several buildings would be completely without power. Designated land-line phones in the hallways of residence halls and in other common areas of residential buildings would be operational. Cellular coverage would likely be erratic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An outage would likely impact both employee housing and graduate-student housing. The impact on Family Student Housing is unclear, and would depend on which grids PG&amp;E de-energizes. Summer Session students who are staying at Colleges Nine and Ten should see minimal impact, as both colleges have generator support.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additional guidance for students living on campus will be sent from Campus Housing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An outage may make it difficult for some employees working tonight to do their jobs. University leaders recognize this impact. If you lose power at your worksite, please notify your supervisor and they will provide direction.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Outage tips</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Students living in relative proximity to the campus who have been already evacuated or who are later required to evacuate will be welcomed on campus while that possibility exists. However, the campus could be directed to evacuate on short notice. We truly understand how this emergency situation adds stress at an already challenging time.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>IF YOU ARE ABLE TO DO SO</strong><span>:</span><span>&#160; As a precautionary measure we encourage you to promptly arrange for travel or for someone to pick you up to take you to temporary housing at a friend&#8217;s or relative&#8217;s home outside the threatened area as soon as possible.&#160; Be prepared for heavy traffic conditions heading into and out of the area. The more prepared you are in advance of an evacuation order, should that come, the better.</span></p>

Santa Cruz history professor Eric Porter</image-alt><image-caption><strong>UC Santa Cruz history professor Eric Porter</strong></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span><strong><i>Playing for Keeps: Improvisation in the Aftermath </i></strong>is an exploration of the various ways that musical improvisation can be used as a method for responding to crisis and dealing with trauma and stress.</span></p>
<p><span>Co-edited by UC Santa Cruz history professor Eric Porter with Daniel Fischlin, the book is a collection of 12 pieces that illustrate how--in places ranging from South Africa and Egypt to the United States, Canada and the Canary Islands--improvisation provides the means for its participants to address the past and imagine the future.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Taken together, the essays in the book look at the various ways that people have used improvisation to negotiate lingering violence and uncertainty, to address trauma, and to imagine alternative futures in the aftermaths of crises in settler-colonialism, post-apartheid, post-war, and postcolonial societies,&#8221; said Porter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The authors are especially attuned to the particular ways that collaborative improvisational practices--creating in the moment, together--have the capacity to build community, help people occupy and change the dynamics of public space, and generally to help people to survive and sometimes thrive amidst difficult political and social circumstances,&#8221; he added.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Eight essays are accompanied</strong> by 27 illustrations, including drawings inspired by Nina Simone&#8217;s political songs from Randy Duburke that feature images of Ku Klux Klan burning crosses, demonstrators demanding racial equality, police brandishing batons, and a man held in a police officer's choke-hold<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The contributors include Stephanie Vos, whose &#8220;The Exhibition of Vandalizim: Improvising Healing,&#160;Politics, and Film in South Africa&#8221; looks at saxophonist/composer Zim Ngqawana and other musicians&#8217; reaction to the burglary and vandalism of their&#160;educational institute. They responded with an improvised concert that served as a healing ritual, allowing them to work through their feelings&#160;and focus their outrage about&#160;lingering inequality in post-apartheid South Africa.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Kate Galloway&#8217;s essay shows how, in collaborations with well known experimental musicians such as the Kronos Quartet, Canadian Inuit throat-singer Tanya Tagaq uses her voice and her music as a political tool to challenge enduring derogatory stereotypes of the Inuit people shaped by colonial history.</span></p>
<p><span>And UCSC alum Kevin Fellezs offers&#160;a piece about the improvised, adaptive strategies Hawaiian musicians have employed over the years in music production, music education, and the recording industry to preserve their tradition and survive economically.</span></p>
<p><span><i>Playing for Keeps</i> additionally includes a poem by saxophonist, composer and visual artist Matana Roberts, plus two interviews&#8212;one with pianist Vijay Iyer about his work with U.S. veterans of color in dealing with war trauma, and the other with two Palestinian music educators who have used music and arts education therapeutically.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Porter noted that the connection</strong> between improvisation and crisis can also be found in our current real-time social and political moment&#8212;a time of pandemic, protests against police violence and systemic racism, and deeply divided partisan politics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen many examples of people improvising together to build community during the Covid-19 pandemic and current protests building from the movement for Black lives,&#8221; said Porter. "Just to name a few well-known cases that have helped people maintain social connections and encouraged perseverance during the Covid-19 lockdown: the balcony performances in Madrid, Milan, and other European cities, and the jazz jam sessions that happened for 80-something days in a row in front of saxophonist Ray Nathanson&#8217;s Brooklyn home.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;And then the music has been brought to the current protests in all kinds of interesting ways&#8212;from people playing recordings of politically resonant music, to improvised chanting and singing of protest songs and political anthems, to musicians taking to the streets themselves. One prominent example of the latter is <i>Late Show</i> bandleader Jon Batiste performing at protests and leading New Orleans style second-line marches in New York City. Batiste is from New Orleans, and there is a rich tradition of African American musical parading going back to the 19th century, where musicians and the second-line that follows them have asserted and celebrated their presence across urban spaces through improvisational performance and sometimes engaged in explicit political protest.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;And, of course, the presence of music in the protests all makes sense given the long history of improvised Black music, from jazz to hip-hop, in sustaining Black life and serving as a vehicle for political mobilization and affinity for a wide range of people,&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p><span>Porter is also a professor in the History of Consciousness Department at UC Santa Cruz, as well as principal faculty in Critical Race and Ethnic Studies, and an affiliated faculty member of the Music Department.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the university&#8217;s commitment to transparency and public accountability, including the way it compensates faculty and staff, UC is conducting its annual disclosure of systemwide employee compensation for calendar year 2019. This disclosure parallels last year&#8217;s payroll disclosure and is consistent with similar practices at many other public institutions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The 2019 payroll data, along with a summary analysis, is<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/content-analysis/employees/compensation-reporting.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1598020921391000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENWd1SLpBpz22n8vzKfUNIGdl93w" href="https://www.ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/content-analysis/employees/compensation-reporting.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">available online here</a>. The data will also be available to news media.</p>

Air quality also remains a concern throughout the area.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Should a campus evacuation be necessary, a <a href="https://oes.ucsc.edu/cruzalert/">CruzAlert</a> will be sent. Please heed the CruzAlert. The CruzAlert will outline the actions to take and the evacuation location to report to. As we prepare for a potential evacuation, the following is critical:</p>
<ul>
<li>Though most operations are currently remote due to COVID-19, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>it is important to minimize the number of people on campus who would have to be evacuated.</strong></span> We ask that managers and supervisors limit, to the extent possible, the number of people working on-site, unless their role is in direct support of fire response, COVID-19 mitigation, or other essential functions needed to support those living on campus or supporting critical infrastructure.&#160;</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If you live on campus and you have a safe place to relocate to out of the area, we continue to strongly encourage you to proactively relocate.</strong></span> This reduces the number of people on campus we need to evacuate and also reduces additional strain on traffic and the roadways leading into and out of the Santa Cruz area. Some roadways, including Empire Grade and Highway 1 headed north of Western Drive, are closed to prevent individuals traveling into areas within the evacuation zone.</li>
<li>Please be prepared for a quick evacuation whether you live on campus or in the region. An emergency can strike quickly. Advance notice may be very brief. Please continue to follow the Red Cross evacuation preparation guidance. More information can be found on the Red Cross Wildfire Safety <a href="https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/wildfire.html">website</a>.
<ul>
<li>Be ready in a moment&#8217;s notice; be sure to pack belongings such as clothing, non-perishable foods for you and your service or support animal if you have one, medications and copies of important documents.</li>
<li>If you have not already done so, sign up for or update your UCSC Cruz Alert notifications <a href="https://oes.ucsc.edu/cruzalert/">here </a>-- this is among the most effective means for receiving urgent campus-specific information and updates. Updates may also be found <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/fire/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Listen to local radio and television stations for updated emergency information.</li>
<li>Students living on campus who do not have access to a vehicle will receive directions from the campus in the event evacuation is deemed necessary. Transit support will be provided to move you from campus to a UCSC evacuation site.</li>
<li><strong>Please have your University ID or other form of identification with you</strong> if you plan to go to the UCSC evacuation site.</li>
<li>It may be helpful to bring your own bed linens, pillows, towels, etc.</li>
<li>More information can be found on the Red Cross Wildfire Safety <a href="https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/wildfire.html">website</a>.&#160;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Continue to follow COVID-19 prevention best practices, including wearing a face covering and physical distancing.&#160;</li>

<div><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Based on the poor air quality and the potential of a campus evacuation, we recommend that all non-essential on-campus research activities cease until the air quality improves and there is more clarity on the fire threat to the campus.

<p dir="ltr"><span>The many fires across the state, and particularly the fires in Santa Cruz county, are causing upheavals, fear, and dislocations for many of our faculty, students, and staff. While instruction in summer classes continues, we understand the fear and disturbance that sudden evacuations can cause. We encourage everyone to be flexible as you consider how to continue instruction in these challenging times.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Students who have been evacuated may not have good access to the internet and other instructional resources, may be dislocated, and may not be able to find a quiet and isolated location to participate in class or do assigned work. We encourage instructors to be flexible in this emergency situation. Students may need extra time or other accommodations in order to be able to complete work, or may wish to request Incomplete (I) grades.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Instructors and TAs may similarly be dislocated by evacuations. As with other disruptions, such as last year&#8217;s power shutoffs and the disruptions of COVID-19, if classes are missed, instructors can provide alternate means for completing the courses&#8217; learning objectives. The chair or college provost sponsoring the course can serve as a resource in discussing these issues, as can we. Communication, between instructors, TAs, and students, is particularly important. </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1598032565068000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG6yy1rD4MFBryXWF59Kc7GmuZZwA" href="https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Keepteaching.ucsc.edu</span></a><span> and last year&#8217;s </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://its.ucsc.edu/fitc/course-dev/missed-content.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1598032565068000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHWqSN1hrtikDJ0b9NSpLEB2dHkRQ" href="https://its.ucsc.edu/fitc/course-dev/missed-content.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>fall guidance</span></a><span> are useful resources.&#160;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Today my heart is with all the members of our community for the challenges we face together. At this moment I am especially concerned for those impacted by the wildfires burning in Santa Cruz County and elsewhere in Northern California. Residents of the mountain communities surrounding UC Santa Cruz have been forced to evacuate their homes in the face of the fast-moving Lightning Complex Fire ignited a few days ago by a dry lightning storm. We know that many UC Santa Cruz faculty, staff, students, and alumni are among those displaced by the fires. We are working to support our UCSC faculty, staff and students who are on and off campus. As this tragic event continues to unfold we are reminded that our community&#8217;s safety is the most important aspect of any crisis. Evacuations are important because they free up first responders to focus on battling the fire rather than on rescuing people who may find themselves trapped by the fires. This morning&#8217;s news reports indicate that approximately 40,000 acres have burned so far and the fire is 0% contained. The fire has burned several structures so far and we know that those who have evacuated are worried that they will face the loss of their homes.&#160;</span></span><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><span>There have been no fires or damage at the residential campus, Coastal Science Campus, West Side Research Park, our Scotts Valley Center and our Silicon Valley campus. Our Lick Observatory community has been evacuated and firefighters are on Mount Hamilton working to contain the blaze. Conditions can change quickly, and we have plans in place and are prepared to evacuate the campus should an order come. All campus information is available at </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ucsc.edu/fire/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1598034445683000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFL9vxK4HBeVzfrjiCxtYQh546h4A" href="https://www.ucsc.edu/fire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ucsc.edu/fire</span></a><span>.

<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">In a crisis like the one we currently face, the best course for all of us is to respond with generosity of spirit. It is too soon to know if the fires will delay activities related to the start of the fall quarter. Any changes from previously announced plans will come as we have greater clarity about the impacts of the fire. In the meantime, we ask that all Banana Slugs near and far keep us in your thoughts and in the coming days think about how we can support those members of our community.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">These words have never been more true or important: Stay safe, stay well, and stay connected.&#160;</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>We understand the stress that many of you may be experiencing; the addition of the fires on top of an already difficult year has been a challenge. Please know that we want to support you as you navigate these difficult times.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Many of you are taking classes during Summer Session. The fires may be impacting you or loved ones, making it difficult or impossible to join scheduled classes, to complete work, or find a quiet location to participate in class or do assigned work. If this is the case, please be sure to be in touch with your instructor about the class when you are able. I have encouraged instructors to be flexible in this emergency situation.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The fires may also be impacting your instructors or teaching assistants. Some classes may not be held as scheduled, or there may be other impacts to your course. Your instructors will work to ensure that all students are able to achieve the learning objectives of the course, but there may be some adjustments in end-of-term work or schedule where necessary.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Depending on your circumstances, it is possible to request an Incomplete (I) grade from your instructor. Instructors can assign Incomplete (I) grades when work is of passing quality but is not yet complete. Undergraduate students receiving an Incomplete (I) will have until the end of fall quarter, December 18, 2020, to complete the work; graduate students will have until the end of fall quarter 2021 to complete the work.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Although the Withdrawal (W) deadline is passed, undergraduates in emergency situations can request a late Withdrawal (W) grade if they are not able to complete the class. UCSC undergraduate students should discuss this option with their college advisor; visiting students should discuss this with the Summer Session Office (</span><a href="mailto:summer@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>summer@ucsc.edu</span></a><span>). Note that many staff are also being affected by the fire, and we appreciate your patience as we all navigate this difficult time together.</span></p>

<div>Dear Faculty and Researchers,<br/><br/>Earlier today you received an email from me recommending that non-essential on-campus research operations temporarily cease due to the smoke and potential fire hazard. The situation has worsened and although the evacuation zone still does not include any campus space, it now extends to the entire region west of the Coastal Science Campus, Westside Research Park, and the residential campus and far to the North and an evacuation order for the campus could come at any time. Consequently, and at the direction of the CPEVC, I am now directing that all non-essential research operations at all Santa Cruz locations cease immediately. Please shut down all equipment as you would normally do for winter curtailment, secure chemicals in fire-safe storage, and secure lab notebooks and other irreplaceable items if possible.<br/><br/>As there is a risk that the fire may spread to the campus and there will be too little time to secure our research materials in the event of an evacuation, we have rapidly pulled together arrangements to move essential research materials off campus for a period of time, as follows:<br/><br/><strong>1. Securing essential research materials (reagents, cell lines, chemicals) in need of cold storage</strong><br/><br/>Due to the logistical challenges and safety precautions necessary, our freezers must shelter in place. We have obtained freezer (-80&#186; C, -20&#186; C) and refrigerator (4&#186; C) space at UCSF and Stanford to secure irreplaceable or difficult to replace reagents, cell lines, chemicals, etc. that need to be preserved. Please carefully consider what materials in your refrigerators, freezers and liquid nitrogen tanks are essential to move. Space is quite limited, so we would like everybody to focus on only the most critical items and restrict to 3 boxes no bigger than 5.25 x 5.25 x 2 in for -80&#186; C space, 3 boxes no bigger than 5.25 x 5.25 x 2 in for -20&#186; C space and 3 boxes no bigger than 10 x 10 x 6 in for 4&#186; C space. <em>Please utilize the minimum space absolutely required.</em><br/><br/>Each box must be labeled with:<br/>1. UC Santa Cruz<br/>2. Lab name and contact info (contact name, email address, phone number)<br/>3. Date<br/>4. Description of contents<br/><br/>We also need a list of contents prepared and e-mailed to <a href="mailto:jomacmil@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">jomacmil@ucsc.edu</a>.<br/><br/><em>Anything that is a major chemical hazard or biological hazard that requires special transport cannot be included as part of these materials.</em><br/><br/>Boxes will be collected on the Westside Research Park loading dock between 2:30 and 4:30 PM today. <br/><br/>(If anybody has extra coolers or large dry ice containers that they can loan for the move, please bring them along.)<br/><br/><strong>2. Securing essential research materials that do not need cold storage (reagents, artwork, rare and valuable books, etc.)</strong><br/><br/>In most cases, the current locations of these items are safe, with comprehensive fire suppression systems in the buildings. Careful consideration should therefore be given as to whether any research materials should be moved to what could prove to be a less secure location. Any items identified for relocation must be moved by the owners to the Westside Research Park. Please place all items in a secure container and label with the following:<br/>1. UC Santa Cruz<br/>2. Lab name and contact info (contact name, email address, phone number)<br/>3. Date<br/>4. Description of contents<br/><br/>We also need a list of contents prepared and e-mailed to <a href="mailto:jomacmil@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">jomacmil@ucsc.edu</a>.<br/><br/><em>Anything that is a major chemical hazard or biological hazard that requires special transport cannot be included as part of these materials.</em><br/><br/>Boxes will be collected on the Westside Research Park loading dock between 2:30 and 4:30 PM today.<br/><br/><strong>3. Securing essential digital data</strong><br/><br/>PIs should assume that all campus systems may become inoperable during an evacuation. PIs are encouraged to back up critical data to offsite locations.<br/><br/><strong>4. Securing living research materials (mice, etc.)</strong><br/><br/>We are unable to coordinate a campuswide response on short notice. Anyone whose research depends upon live research materials should work directly with colleagues on other campuses to make arrangements to preserve your research. Please be aware of and respect the requirements on transporting animals and any hazardous materials.

Hamilton sustained some damage, but fire crews have so far been able to protect the observatory’s telescope domes and visitor center</article-subhead><article-text><p>As of 1 p.m. Thursday, the University of California&#8217;s Lick Observatory appeared to have escaped serious damage as the SCU Lightning Complex Fire swept across Mt. Hamilton east of San Jose on Wednesday. All observatory staff and Mt. Hamilton residents are safe.</p>
<p>UC Observatories Director Claire Max said firefighting units from Cal Fire and other organizations were stationed at Lick Observatory all night, using the observatory&#8217;s buildings as a command center and as a safety zone for the crews.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks to their tremendous efforts, the telescope domes did not burn,&#8221; Max said.</p>
<p>One residence that was not being used did burn completely, and several other residences sustained some structural damage, as well as smoke and water damage. A potential conflagration on the observatory&#8217;s Kepler Peak, where several residences are located, was averted through major efforts by fire crews overnight. Lick Observatory Superintendent Kostas Chloros described very high and hot flames surrounding Kepler Peak, but it appears all structures in the area were spared.</p>
<p>Max emphasized, however, that the danger to the observatory is not yet over. Some key areas were left unburned last night, and firefighters are concerned that the fire may circle back. Crews have been working hard to clear more space around the dome of the Shane 3-meter Telescope and several other nearby structures.</p>
<p>Mt. Hamilton is located within the Calaveras Zone of the SCU Lightning Complex Fire, which consists of about 20 separate fires burning in steep, rugged terrain throughout five counties.</p>
<p>Founded in 1888, Lick Observatory is at the forefront of astronomical research as an active research facility. Max said messages of concern about the fire have been coming in from observatories around the world.</p>
<p>Lick Observatory is operated by the University of California Observatories (UCO), a multi-campus research unit that serves eight UC campuses and is headquartered at UC Santa Cruz. More information is available online at <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/">www.ucolick.org</a>. Information about the fire is also being posted on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LickObservatory">Lick Observatory Facebook page</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update, August 24, 2020:</strong> The fire that swept through the site of Lick Observatory last week has now moved on to the south. A strike team has been stationed at Lick to deal with potential day-time flare-ups from remaining hot spots. Most of the major structures at the observatory were saved, including all of the telescopes and their domes, but some of the residences were damaged and there will be high costs associated with rebuilding damaged infrastructure. To help address these needs, gifts can be made to the <a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=780&amp;cid=1749&amp;dids=1026">UCO Director's Discretionary Fund</a>.</p>
<p>For more information, tune in to a special virtual event on Tuesday, August 25, from 4 to 4:45 p.m., at <a href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/j/98932317498">https://ucsc.zoom.us/j/98932317498</a>. UCO Director Claire Max will answer questions about the wildfires impacting Lick Observatory. Mt. Hamilton staff will join her to help provide updates on known damage and potential future repairs, as well as science timelines and priorities. They will try to answer questions in the chat, but will prioritize those questions sent in advance to social@ucolick.org.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0d984b298072701763b3cba64dde64b7"><name>initiating-next-steps-in-our-fire-response</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Initiating the next steps in our fire response - beginning next stages of voluntary evacuations</title><summary>As the conditions around Santa Cruz county worsen and the fires impacting our region continue to grow, we are now initiating several critical steps in our fire response.</summary><start-date>1597955640000</start-date><display-name>Initiating the next steps in our fire response - beginning next stages of voluntary evacuations</display-name><path>/2020/08/initiating-next-steps-in-our-fire-response</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/08/initiating-next-steps-in-our-fire-response</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1597955918596</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1597955918596</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Emergency</value><value>Administrative Message</value><value>Campus Updates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>As the conditions around Santa Cruz county worsen and the fires impacting our region continue to grow, we are now initiating several critical steps in our fire response.

This could happen at any moment.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Please heed ALL guidance. </strong><span>The CruzAlert will outline the actions to take and the evacuation location to report to.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Initiating the next stage of voluntary on-campus evacuations&#160;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We have been encouraging all those who live on campus to proactively leave if they have a safe location to relocate to out of the area. It is critical that we continue to do so to decrease the number of people on campus that will have to be evacuated if and when a mandatory evacuation is issued for our campus. It also decreases pressure points on roadways. There are already numerous roadway closures in the area.&#160; So we ask the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>If you live on campus (both students and employees) and have a safe place to go, we ask that you relocate now.&#160; &#160;</strong></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you live on campus and do not have an alternative location to evacuate to, we have staged the Santa Cruz Boardwalk area as the official evacuation location for those who live on campus and have nowhere else to go.&#160; As space is limited, we need to prioritize that population for use of this evacuation location.&#160; Beginning at 2:00 pm today, those campus residents who do not have alternative evacuation locations can begin to relocate there. At this point the evacuation is voluntary, but at any moment the campus evacuation could become mandatory. Check in at this site will take place at Entrance B across from the Parking Lot at the Boardwalk. Campus officials will direct you on next steps once you arrive. Additional information with useful tips and information on transportation will be coming out from campus housing to our students and employees who live on campus. Please ensure you have a University ID or other form of identification with you if you relocate to the UC Santa Cruz evacuation location.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you do not live on campus, please follow the evacuation orders and directions provided by first responders for your exact location.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>County and fire officials advise that people who have&#160; to evacuate the area may&#160; not be able to return to their homes through the end of August or potentially the first week in September. Individual circumstances will differ, but keep this in mind when you are evacuating.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Once an evacuation order becomes mandatory, the campus will declare a campus emergency. At that point, evacuations are not voluntary.&#160;</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Beginning the shut down of key campus systems and infrastructure:&#160;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As a precautionary safety step, we will start shutting down several campus systems in preparation for an active fire on the residential campus. This is referred to as &#8220;hardening the campus&#8221;. Once that process is complete and as conditions warrant, some of these actions could be taken at our other Santa Cruz locations. This includes:</span></p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Shutting down the Cogen. </strong><span>We will be powering down the campus Cogeneration plant starting at 2:00 pm. The campus will then be operating solely on PGE power. If we have a PG&amp;E power outage, those buildings that have backup emergency generators will still have some portions of their operations supported.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Shutting down natural gas:</strong><span> We will begin shutting down natural gas to all buildings on campus. This will impact operations that are powered by natural gas, such as hot water. Natural gas fed to emergency generators will not be shut off. This activity will start around 1:00 pm. We are focusing on non-residential buildings first, but can not predict exactly when each building on campus will be shut off.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Fire and smoke barrier door closure:</strong><span> We will be closing all doors that are part of the fire and smoke barriers in all buildings. If you are onsite in buildings please close these doors and do not open them back up.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Minimizing the electrical load:</strong><span> We will begin shutting down all unnecessary power loads. This includes lighting, HVAC, chillers, and boilers.&#160; This does not apply to life safety systems or other critical or sensitive loads such as chemical storage.&#160;</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Other key updates and actions</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you do not have to come to campus to support these critical operations and fire response,</span><span> do not come to campus.</span><span> This only adds to the challenges we face in supporting the prompt and efficient evacuation of our residents on campus.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Please be prepared for a quick evacuation whether you live on campus or in the region. An emergency can strike quickly and advance notice may be very brief.

<p>The fellowships are awarded to emerging scientific leaders who are prepared to work at the intersections of environmental health, community health and resilience, and offshore energy system safety in the Gulf of Mexico and other U.S. coastal regions.</p>
<p>Reguero&#8217;s work focuses on assessing the impacts of climate change and coastal hazards on communities and ecosystems, and finding sustainable adaptation solutions that are relevant to decision-makers. His research examines the effects of climate change on waves and extreme sea levels, the role of ecosystems in coastal processes, and evaluating nature-based solutions and other climate-resilient strategies.</p>
<p>&#8220;My scope includes the increasing coastal challenges in the Gulf Coast, but also California and other coastal regions nationally and internationally,&#8221; Reguero said.</p>
<p>The two-year fellowship includes a $76,000 award, mentoring support, and a built-in community of colleagues who share an interest in the well-being of Gulf Coast communities and ecosystems. Since the award is not attached to a specific project, fellows are able to use the support to pursue bold, nontraditional research that they otherwise might not be able to conduct.</p>
<p>Reguero said he plans to focus on understanding and characterizing the effects of extreme weather events and climate change, including socioeconomic effects, and advancing the approach of engineering with nature. This work will also examine the inequality aspects of coastal risk, comparing intensely developed areas with high economic value and vulnerable communities protected by natural infrastructure.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of this work is to inform cost-effective adaptation solutions to the rising challenges of coastal communities in the Gulf Coast, nationally, and internationally.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0dcc5f488072701763b3cba695967b99"><name>z-hacks</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Z Hacks 2020: An inclusive virtual hackathon for students</title><summary>CITRIS at UCSC has been working with Santa Cruz Works, CSU Monterey Bay, and other community partners to plan an inclusive virtual hackathon for students.</summary><start-date>1597906800000</start-date><display-name>Z Hacks 2020: An inclusive virtual hackathon for students</display-name><path>/2020/08/z-hacks</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/08/z-hacks</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1597959331631</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1597959495048</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioweb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/citris-ucsc-logo-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/citris-ucsc-logo-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>citris-ucsc-logo-450.jpg</name><display-name>citris-ucsc-logo-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>43937</file-size><width>450</width><height>123</height></image><image-alt>citris logo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/05/images/citris-ucsc-logo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/05/images/citris-ucsc-logo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>citris-ucsc-logo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>citris-ucsc-logo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23146</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>citris logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Most hackathons focus on software development and coding. A new hackathon for students called Z Hacks, however, invites a broader range of project entries, from code to any kind of art, including dance, poetry, painting, or sculpture.</p>
<p>&#8220;The focus is on creating solutions for social justice, the environment, and pandemic-related challenges, but not just technical solutions. Participants can submit creative projects in addition to coding software projects,&#8221; said Michael Matkin, assistant director of CITRIS and the Banatao Institute at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>CITRIS at UCSC has been working with Santa Cruz Works, CSU Monterey Bay, and other community partners to plan this inclusive virtual hackathon for students. Z Hacks 2020 will run from September 19 to 25, and interested students can get full information and register online at <a href="https://zhacks.devpost.com">zhacks.devpost.com</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This event is unique in that it's open to all students, regardless of technical abilities, as long as they attended school in 2019 or will attend in 2020-21,&#8221; Matkin said.</p>
<p>Z Hacks also has a unique system for distributing awards. Winners will choose a nonprofit organization to which they donate the majority of the purse, and can keep up to 10% to fund their next project. The organizers expect the purse for awards to grow to more than $50,000.</p>
<p>The sponsors of Z Hacks 2020 include Joby Aviation, Santa Cruz Works, CSUMB Institute for Innovation and Economic Development, the Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz, CITRIS at UCSC, the Small Business Development Center at Cabrillo College, and other community organizations.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0de145d88072701763b3cba663405d48"><name>evacuation-warning</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Evacuation Warning</title><summary>This is not an evacuation order, but rather a warning to be prepared to evacuate. </summary><start-date>1597957200000</start-date><display-name>Evacuation Warning</display-name><path>/2020/08/evacuation-warning</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/08/evacuation-warning</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1597960701376</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1597962588584</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>Emergency</value><value>Campus Updates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>This is </span><span>not </span><span>an evacuation order, but rather a warning to be prepared to evacuate.&#160;</span></p>

<p>Numerous wildfires burn throughout the state. On August 18, 2020, Governor Gavin Newsom issued a state of emergency in California due to fires burning statewide. As of this date,</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is impacted by the wildfires burning in Santa Cruz County and elsewhere in Northern California. Residents of the mountain communities surrounding UC Santa Cruz have been forced to evacuate their homes in the face of the fast-moving Lightning Complex Fire ignited a few days ago by a dry lightning storm.</p>
<p>Emergent conditions exist on or within the vicinity of the campus and pose a threat of serious injury to persons or damage to property because of the Lightening Complex Fires. This evening&#8217;s news reports indicate that the Lightening Complex Fires have: merged and continue to actively burn due to low relative humidities, high day and night-time temperatures, inaccessible terrain and limited resources; resulted in over 28,000 people in several communities being evacuated or are under a warning; and burned across over 40,000 acres with 0% containment as of this morning. As this tragic event continues to unfold extraordinary measures are required immediately to avert, alleviate, or repair damage to University property or to maintain the orderly operation of the campus. Evacuations are an important part of this effort because they free up first responders to focus on battling the fire rather than on rescuing people who may find themselves trapped by the fires.</p>
<p>In the context of a rapidly evolving situation, the great risk to loss of life or property, depleted firefighting resources, difficult terrain, and limited visibility, it is essential to nimbly and rapidly respond at a moment&#8217;s notice.</p>
<p><strong>Chancellor&#8217;s Order</strong></p>
<p>WHEREFORE, AS CHANCELLOR OF THE UC SANTA CRUZ CAMPUS I DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY TO EXIST ON THE FOLLOWING UC SANTA CRUZ LOCATIONS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Residential Campus</li>
<li>Coastal Science Campus</li>
<li>Westside Research Park.</li>
</ul>
<p>I FURTHER DECLARE:</p>
<ul>
<li>These areas are closed.</li>
<li>Consistent with the authority under California Penal Code Section 409.5, UC Santa Cruz Police Department will close these areas for the duration of this order to any and all persons not authorized to enter or remain.</li>
<li>Anyone not authorized to enter or remain at any of these facilities is subject to arrest and/or emergency suspension, until such time this declaration is rescinded.</li>

As the members of our Slug community continue to deal with the wildfires and evacuations, we want to outline some of the resources available to you. We know that a large portion of our employee base has been evacuated from locations across our region. Many of our employees who have roles in our fire response efforts have been impacted personally. We also have reports of employees who have lost their homes. The challenges many of you are facing are immense and it is vital that we come together to support our colleagues in need.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Immediate housing and evacuation support&#160;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Yesterday, we opened up our University Town Center to employees who had been displaced by evacuations and had nowhere else to go.&#160; That facility has now filled up. If slots become available as employees find other locations to relocate to, we will let you know.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Based on your home location, you can contact the CAL Fire information line at 831-335-6717 </span><span>for evacuation guidance.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Red Cross Shelter line is available at </span><span>866-272-2237. They can assist you with shelter locations.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For employees who live on campus, and do not have a place to go, we are evacuating them to the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk Cocoanut Grove. Specific evacuation guidance has been sent to those living in employee housing.</span><span>&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Emergency Loans and Financial Assistance</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The University has an emergency loan program through two credit unions that</span><span> will provide Emergency Loans to UC employees. The two credit unions are &#8211; </span><strong>USE Credit Union</strong><span> and</span><strong> University Credit Union.&#160;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Both suppliers have UC negotiated interest rates, are in complete compliance with the Truth in Lending requirements, and will provide online application tools for employees to directly apply for emergency loans.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>I am writing to provide an update about UCSC and the Lightning Complex Fire. Thursday afternoon we received an evacuation warning for the campus and began relocating students and employees living on campus to the Cocoanut Grove at the Boardwalk. We also began preparing for the possibility that the fire reaches the campus. Conditions later prompted a mandatory evacuation for our residential campus Thursday evening. As of this morning, the fire is about a mile north of upper campus. There is no fire activity on campus or in the City of Santa Cruz, and we hope that all our activities have been taken in an abundance of caution. This morning&#8217;s news reports indicate that approximately 50,000 acres have burned so far and the fire is 0% contained. The fire continues to advance, and much of what will happen next depends on weather conditions such as wind direction and speed. We will continue to provide updates and information about the campus at </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ucsc.edu/fire/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1598110414579000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHFhwYAjHVrEyetiLtww4Pvo2yLzw" href="https://www.ucsc.edu/fire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ucsc.edu/fire</span></a><span>. We are so grateful for CalFire and the crews who are doing all they can to help contain the fire and protect the campus.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Evacuating the campus required the support and collaboration of many people and organizations. I want to thank those of you who evacuated early. Your quick action helps ensure our first responders are able to manage the fire and stay safe. I also want to thank the amazing staff members in Colleges, Housing and Educational Services (CHES) for their coordination of the evacuation effort and support of our campus residents&#8217; needs. Our UCSC Police Department safely evacuated our campus, going door-to-door to ensure each person in our community was safe. I would also like to thank the Seaside Company for throwing open its doors to our campus residents including providing space for campus dining to continue feeding our students and our community. Finally, so many people have volunteered to support our evacuation efforts outside of the scope of their normal jobs. I could not be more grateful for this community and the way everyone has come together to respond to this crisis.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As we face this crisis together, our thoughts are with all members of our Banana Slug community &#8212; students, staff, faculty, alumni, and friends directly affected by the fire. Please know that we are continuing to work on ways to support our campus community during this difficult time. And for all facing the COVID-19 crisis, we hope that you are keeping well and adhering to our Slug Strong actions to keep you and members of your community safe.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We will make it through this challenge and emerge a stronger and more resilient UC Santa Cruz. Please keep our university community in your thoughts &#8212; and stay safe, stay well, and stay connected.&#160;</span></p>

A wildfire that began Tuesday night swept north to south over the 8,000 acres that UC Santa Cruz manages as part of the UC Natural Reserve system.</p>
<p>"The reserve is still burning," Dayton said. &#8220;Some areas will be charred black. We won&#8217;t know the impact on the natural resources for some time.&#8221; <br/><br/>Called the Dolan Fire, the blaze is believed to have been started intentionally around 8 p.m. Tuesday in John Little State Nature Reserve about 3 miles north of the Big Creek entrance off Highway 1. By Saturday morning it had grown to more than 14,000 acres with 10% containment. The Monterey County Sheriff&#8217;s Office has arrested a 30-year-old Fresno man on suspicion of arson.<br/><br/>Dayton said the fire seemed to slow late Tuesday night then exploded overnight Wednesday, jumping Big Creek and burning into the Big Creek reserve where researchers and students work on a variety of projects ranging from sea otters to old growth redwoods, and coastal stream habitat. Three campgrounds, a research cabin, and a small laboratory/library are on site. <br/><br/>&#8220;The whole reserve was pretty much on fire, there was fire everywhere,&#8221; Dayton said Big Creek Director Mark Readdie told him. <br/><br/>&#8220;All staff are safe, they&#8217;ve been doing just an incredible job working hard to help support fire crews,&#8221; Dayton said. <br/><br/>He said Readdie and natural reserve staff members Sean McStay, Feynner Arias, Hadley Hargrove, Nora Grant, and Mackneal Byers helped support crews from CalFire, the U.S. Forest Service, and Big Sur volunteer firefighters, beginning in the early hours of Wednesday through Thursday to save a facility along Coyote Creek and other structures. Approximately 60 personnel were involved. Heavy smoke and rugged terrain prevented aerial attacks. <br/><br/>What really made a difference, Dayton said, was firefighting preparedness made in the past several years, including creating defensible space around buildings and installing sprinkler systems and reserve water tanks. <br/><br/>A 15,000-gallon tank installed at the Whale Point researcher cabin on the ridgeline helped power sprinklers that wetted down the structure and saved it, he said.<br/><br/>Fire is a natural part of the ecosystem, Dayton said. Two major fires in the past 35 years, one in 1985 and one in 1999, swept across the area. The reserve was missed by a major Big Sur fire in 2008.<br/><br/>&#8220;These areas burn and the land is resilient,&#8221; Dayton said. But many years of dry conditions and a buildup of fuel means hotter and more destructive fires, he said.</p>

<p><strong>Update, August 24, 2020: </strong>Fires continue to burn in the area of Big Creek Natural Reserve, but all of the main UC facilities at the reserve remain standing. UCSC Natural Reserves Director Gage Dayton said it will probably be weeks before staff can assess the status of the entire reserve, including campgrounds and water storage infrastructure, adding, &#8220;We are all concerned about the reserve&#8217;s neighbors and friends in the area who may have lost structures in the fire.&#8221;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Other staff members from around campus and I are working to support you through this.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Yesterday, the chancellor issued a </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/08/chancellor-declaration.html"><span>Declaration of Emergency</span></a><span> which began the process of campus evacuation. Shortly after, a mandatory evacuation order was issued by Cal FIRE. UCSC has set up an evacuation center open to students in the local Santa Cruz area, and who are facing evacuation.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The evacuation center, located at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, is open to any student who needs a place to go during the fires and evacuations. There are staff members ready to greet you, provide you with a warm meal and help you continue to stay safe while the fires and evacuation orders persist. Pack a bag with essential clothing, toiletries and any medicine that you take. Bring your student ID. COVID-19 safety precautions are in place at the center.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We are also providing meals at the evacuation center for all students today and during the period of evacuation.&#160; The schedule for meals is: 8:30 am, 12:30 pm, and 5:30 pm. Please present your student ID upon arrival at the evacuation center and let the check-in staff know that you are stopping in for a meal only.</span></p>

<p>Through the tireless work of CAL FIRE and first responders, the CZU Lightning Complex Fire that threatens our campus is now 5% contained. CAL FIRE created fire breaks from Highway 1 to Highway 9 to help decrease the threat of fire to additional areas, including UC Santa Cruz and the city of Santa Cruz. This has been an incredible effort and we cannot thank our firefighters, the teams that support them, and our staff members who have supported this effort enough. However, we know that the situation could change quickly and everyone must remain evacuated from our campus and alert to changing conditions.</p>
<p>We are happy to report that all of the students who could proactively depart from campus are accounted for. Thanks to the generosity of San Jose State University, over 30 evacuated UCSC students have been relocated to SJSU residence halls where they are also supported by two of our fantastic housing staff members. We are also working to ensure support for all students who live in the greater Santa Cruz area.</p>
<p>We remain grateful to the Seaside Company for facilitating a campus evacuation center at the Boardwalk and for the use of the Cocoanut Grove kitchen allowing our amazing Dining team to prepare meals for our evacuated students and employees and continue their work supporting the county and first responders. Our UCSC emergency team and first responders sprang into action earlier this week and have worked tirelessly to coordinate both the evacuation and support of displaced students and employees. Given UCSC&#8217;s role in our community, the ability to stand up our own evacuation center helped to reduce the impacts on the Red Cross and County efforts to shelter community evacuees.</p>
<p>With so many fires burning across Northern California, two of our sites outside of Santa Cruz have been impacted by different fires. I want to share that the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/08/mt-hamilton-fire.html">SCU Lightning Complex Fire has passed through the Lick Observatory site</a> . Every person who was on site is safe. Only one unused building was lost on the site and all of the historic telescopes were saved. The heroism and tireless work of CAL FIRE, first responders, and the observatory staff is in evidence in this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LickObservatory/videos/875203383007095/">time lapse video</a> that shows just how close the fire came. We also have good news about the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/08/big-creek-dolan-fire.html">Landis Hill - Big Creek Reserve on the Big Sur coast, which has been threatened by the Dolan Fire</a> . Though some areas of the reserve are still burning, the natural reserve staff are all safe. We are so grateful that thanks to the quick work by fire crews and our UCSC staff, as well as the staff&#8217;s foresight around fire preparedness, the research and residential buildings at the reserve have been saved.</p>
<p>Friday evening, Vice Chancellor for Business and Administrative Services Sarah Latham shared a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPuTN3EOpzgLw0gcbNI-M42eV3USpe5Wx6e90SQAztzkCSYg/viewform">survey to gather information from students and employees who have lost their homes</a> so that we can provide support. Interim Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Success Jennifer Baszile shared a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6YcfBpuHcRZF7AfBptShehUb2soUqfrp2aLzeTGYkuao-lQ/viewform">survey for off-campus students</a> to assess their situation and needs. You can find all of our messages regarding the fire and consistent updates at <a href="https://status.ucsc.edu/fire/">ucsc.edu/fire</a> .</p>
<p>While we currently have favorable weather conditions, that can change at any point and we know that dry lightning and less-favorable wind is in the forecast. Please continue to follow all evacuation warnings and orders and be prepared for sudden changes. Our Banana Slug community has come together in such incredible ways and it is the efforts of each of you that have made it possible for us to have a little good news to share today. I will provide another update early next week although you may receive operational updates if the situation changes. Until then, stay safe, stay well, and stay connected.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">We have received reports of scams during this time of crisis. It is disheartening to hear about these situations. Some individuals are getting calls from people claiming to be a representative from PG&amp;E or another agency, and stating that the recipient of the call owes money. The Sheriff's Department has warned individuals to be cautious, as these calls are not legitimate.&#160;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><span>Our residential campus, Westside Research Park, and Coastal Science Campus remain closed, and </span><span>you should not</span><span> attempt to access these locations. We continue to get reports of individuals trying to enter these areas. By doing so they are threatening not only their own safety, but diverting resources and personnel from the critical fire prevention work our first responders need to focus on. Once conditions permit the chancellor&#8217;s emergency order to be modified, we will begin the process reviewing facilities and permitting some university activities to resume on a priority basis.&#160;</span></span></p>

<p>Researchers at Long Marine Lab started to worry about the lab&#8217;s marine mammals well before campus officials ordered the evacuation of the UCSC Coastal Science Campus. Ash from the wildfires raging in the Santa Cruz Mountains was falling onto the lab&#8217;s saltwater pools, and the air was thick with smoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;People were wearing masks, but the animals had no such filtered protection, and we feared for their lungs,&#8221; said Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, whose Marine Mammal Research and Conservation Lab includes two adult male bottlenose dolphins and an adult male Hawaiian monk seal.</p>
<p>In addition, staff were worried there wouldn&#8217;t be time to get the animals out in the event of an emergency evacuation order. By the time the evacuation order came through on Thursday, August 20, the animals were already safely on their way to other facilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to hand it to everyone involved and extend our thanks to Sea World and the Marine Mammal Center, who immediately accepted our animals on a moment&#8217;s notice,&#8221; said Daniel Costa, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences. &#8220;Everybody stepped up to the plate, and it just shows what a wonderful community our marine mammal program is a part of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colleen Reichmuth, director of the Pinniped Cognition and Sensory Systems Laboratory, said the move went as smoothly as possible for her program&#8217;s five animals. The well-trained pinnipeds&#8212;a California sea lion, a harbor seal, a ringed seal, and two bearded seals&#8212;readily made their way into large kennels and cages for transportation to the Marine Mammal Center.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been here for 30 years, and we&#8217;ve never had to evacuate the marine lab before, but all of our emergency response plans really worked well, and the support from Sea World and the Marine Mammal Center was amazing,&#8221; Reichmuth said. &#8220;Our partners at the Marine Mammal Center even sent their rescue transport teams and vehicles to assist us on site.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moving the dolphins (Donley and Rain) and the Hawaiian monk seal (Kekoa), each weighing over 400 pounds, posed bigger logistical challenges. Williams said she was impressed when trainer Beau Richter convinced Kekoa to haul out of his pool, slide across the deck, and scooch down a ramp into a large cage.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew that it had taken a year of training to achieve this string of behaviors, but they made it look easy,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>To move the dolphins, it was necessary to drain their pool and place each dolphin into a soft, fleece-lined sling. As the water level dropped in their pool, the dolphins comforted each other by keeping their flukes in contact. Once securely in their slings, each dolphin was lifted out of the pool with a forklift and lowered into a custom-made dolphin transporter which could be filled with salt water for the trip to Sea World.</p>
<p>Lab manager Traci Kendall had arranged for a refrigerated truck to transport the animals, because they would be passing through triple-digit temperatures in the Central Valley on their way to San Diego. Williams said the two dolphins managed to keep in touch with each other despite riding in separate transporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although separated visually, the two pair-bonded dolphins immediately struck up a squeaking, whistling conversation in the truck that lasted the entire duration of the trip to southern California,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Donley periodically raised his head up to peek at his traveling buddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kekoa, on the other hand, remained stoic as usual, she said. &#8220;When everyone started delving into snacks, the dolphins accepted a smelt or two from the ice cooler filled with fish, while the monk seal not only ate his dinner, he requested seconds in a series of snorts and chuffs.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of the marine mammals at Long Marine Laboratory are involved in research programs that support efforts to protect these species and conserve their natural habitats. In addition to the marine mammals, the fish and other marine life in the aquariums at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center were also evacuated, thanks to the generosity of the Monterey Bay Aquarium.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s times like this that the true quality and character of the people you work with really shows, and I&#8217;m very proud of our marine mammal program and how they handled this,&#8221; Costa said. &#8220;It speaks to the quality of the program and the planning they&#8217;ve done. When the emergency came, they were ready to act. Everybody involved&#8212;the staff, the trainers, our campus veterinarian&#8212;everybody stepped up and got the job done.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="22c2984e8072701763b3cba64358e771"><name>servicios-de-apoyo-para-empleados-</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Servicios de apoyo para empleados impactados por los incendios forestales y evacuaciones</title><summary>Todo miembro de la facultad y del personal que lea esto ha sido impactado de distintas maneras por los incendios forestales actualmente activos en nuestra región.

<p>Viviendas de Emergencia para Empleados</p>
<p>Sabemos que hay algunos empleados que no tienen d&#243;nde alojarse durante el per&#237;odo de evacuaci&#243;n. Hemos alojado a muchos en el Town Center de la Universidad y hoteles del &#225;rea. Si Ud. no tiene un lugar para evacuarse, por favor contacte a nuestra <strong>L&#237;nea Directa de Viviendas de Emergencia para Empleados</strong> en el 831-531-8250. Esta es la nueva l&#237;nea directa que hemos dispuesto y el n&#250;mero est&#225; disponible 7 d&#237;as a la semana de 8 am a 8 pm. Si hay espacio disponible en cualquiera de nuestros actuales sitios de vivienda para emergencia de los empleados, nos ocuparemos de colocarlos a Uds. Tenemos la esperanza de darles prioridad a aquellos que verdaderamente carecen de opciones y que no tienen seguro de propietario o inquilino que les cubra los costos de hotel. Tambi&#233;n podemos conectarlos a Uds. con otras opciones locales.</p>
<p>La UCOP tambi&#233;n ha compartido dos recursos disponibles para empleados que pudieran haber quedado desplazados de sus hogares debido a los incendios forestales.&#160;Esta informaci&#243;n tambi&#233;n ser&#225; publicada en el <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/central-travel-management/connexxus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Connexxus portal</a> de la UC.&#160;</p>
<p>Hay <strong>dos escenarios de Airbnb</strong> basados en la duraci&#243;n del desplazamiento:&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>Desplazamiento inmediato -- del 20 de agosto del 2020 al 10 de septiembre del 2020 &#8211; Airbnb Open Homes <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/openhomes/disaster-relief/norcalfires2020" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.airbnb.com/openhomes/disaster-relief/norcalfires2020</a></li>
<li>Desplazamiento a largo plazo &#8211; para ver el cuadro de la UC en Airbnb en la p&#225;gina del Libro Online del portal Connexxus&#160;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alternativa de Hotel</strong> para Desplazamientos a Corto o Largo Plazo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visite el cuadro del Marriott ubicado en la p&#225;gina del Libro Online en el portal de Connexxus para identificar las tasas de la UC en Marriott, que son menos costosas que las tasas publicadas por Marriott&#160;</li>
<li>Opciones de hotel gratis o con descuentos, visite <a href="https://www.santacruzcounty.us/fireresources" rel="noopener" target="_blank">santacruzcounty.us/fireresources</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Basados en su cobertura de seguro, algunos de estos costos pudieran ser reembolsables por su proveedor. A los empleados con p&#243;lizas de seguro de inquilino tambi&#233;n se les insta a hablar con sus representantes de p&#243;liza para revisar si sus gastos por desplazamiento son reembolsables. Servicios de Riesgo de la&#160;UCOP recomienda a los empleados de la UC desplazados que chequeen su p&#243;liza de seguro de propietario de casa en cuanto a Gastos de Manutenci&#243;n y Alojamiento Adicionales (ALE, por sus siglas en ingl&#233;s) o P&#233;rdida de Uso y que contacten a su proveedor de seguro para cuestiones adicionales.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Servicios de Apoyo Mentales y Emocionales</p>
<p>Los empleados tienen acceso sin costo alguno al asesoramiento y servicios de apoyo disponibles de acuerdo con el <a href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Programa de Asistencia al Empleado</a>. A los empleados se les proporcionan seis sesiones de asesoramiento libres de costo. Ud., tambi&#233;n puede chequear su plan de cobertura m&#233;dica para ver a cu&#225;les servicios de asesoramiento y apoyo Ud. pudiera ser elegible. Mediante el programa de Bienestar para Empleados, el campus tambi&#233;n proporciona servicios de grupos de apoyo para cualquier empleado. Estas sesiones no requieren cita previa y Ud. puede inscribirse y asistir a cuantas quiera.

La l&#237;nea est&#225; abierta 24 horas al d&#237;a, los siete d&#237;as de la semana.&#160;</p>
<p>Pr&#233;stamos y Asistencia Financiera para Emergencias</p>
<p>La universidad tiene un programa de pr&#233;stamos para emergencias mediante dos cooperativas de cr&#233;dito que proporcionar&#225;n pr&#233;stamos de emergencia a los empleados de la UC. Las dos cooperativas de cr&#233;dito son: USE Credit Union y University Credit Union.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Ambos proveedores tienen tasas de inter&#233;s negociadas con la UC, cumplen por completo con los requisitos de Veracidad en Pr&#233;stamos (<em>Truth in Lending</em>), y proporcionar&#225;n instrumentos de solicitud para los empleados que pidan pr&#233;stamos de emergencia directamente.</p>

But quick thinking by UCSC&#8217;s emergency response team and the hard work of campus staff is keeping displaced campus community members safe and supported.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday morning, the fire was 17 percent contained and remains about a mile north of upper campus. Over the weekend, Cal Fire crews created two fire breaks to help keep the fire from advancing toward the City of Santa Cruz and UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Sue Matthews, associate vice chancellor for colleges, housing, and educational services (CHES), said the campus was well prepared for the evacuation, thanks to leadership through the campus Emergency Operations Center.</p>
<p>Matthews talked about the remarkable speed of the response. In the early morning hours of Sunday, Aug. 16&#8212;when the rare and destructive lightning storm hit&#8212;1,215 residents were on campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Thursday evening, when the evacuation was mandated, all remaining tenants were safely and swiftly evacuated,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She said that CHES is well prepared to respond to emergency situations.&#8220;This current fire has called forth the talents of many people who have dedicated time and training, year over year, to be prepared,&#8221; Matthews said.</p>
<p>Fire responders, the UC Santa Cruz Police Department, and staff members in CHES and Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) joined forces to make sure that everyone on campus was taken care of and moved out of the evacuation zone.</p>
<p>"Our Banana Slug community has come together in such incredible ways," noted Chancellor Cynthia Larive in an Aug. 22 message to the campus community.<br/><br/><strong>'Slug Strong'</strong></p>
<p>When the fires broke out, campus residents included undergraduates, graduate students, employees, affiliates, and family members, said Jean Marie Scott, an associate vice chancellor for Business and Administrative Services. Staff members from across the campus demonstrated their problem-solving skills and tireless work ethic to look after this community, Scott said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Simply put, we&#8217;re Slug Strong," she said. Many of the evacuated UC Santa Cruz community members relocated with friends and families. Others were taken to the University Town Center in Santa Cruz or to various Santa Cruz hotels, including the Carousel Beach Inn and the Sea and Sand Inn. <br/><br/>A few stayed overnight at the Cocoanut Grove at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, which was used as a relocation center for UC Santa Cruz. On Friday, about 40 students who needed housing were relocated to residence halls at San Jose State University, which threw open its doors for students in need.<br/><br/><strong>Quickly changing plans</strong><br/><br/>Earlier in the week, prior to the need to move everyone off campus, Scott and the campus&#8217;s emergency management team had talks about setting aside parts of campus as possible evacuation sites that could be used to support evacuees from Boulder Creek, Felton, and other threatened areas.</p>
<p>But the fire grew so quickly that the plan had to change. By Wednesday morning, based on the fire's growth and direction, the campus shifted gears as the team evaluated evacuation. From that point on, the team was &#8220;laser-focused on the risks, challenges, and immediate needs" of campus residents, Scott said.</p>
<p>At that point, UC Santa Cruz already had a major logistical challenge on its hands; the campus had been managing an evacuation of the community that lived on Mount Hamilton, close to UC's historic Lick Observatory, which overlooks San Jose and was in the path of the SCU Lightning Complex Fire. (<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/08/mt-hamilton-fire.html">Lick Observatory appeared to have escaped serious damage</a> as the fire swept across Mt. Hamilton east of San Jose on Wednesday. All observatory staff and Mt. Hamilton residents are safe.)</p>
<p>At the same time, along the Big Sur coast, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/08/big-creek-dolan-fire.html">another wildfire was sweeping across the 8,000-acre Landels-Hill Big Creek Natural Reserve</a> that UC Santa Cruz manages. Six UCSC staff members on site assisted fire crews in protecting research buildings and residences. All are safe. <br/><br/><strong>Drivers at a moment's notice</strong><br/><br/> Campus drivers worked hard to make sure community members could clear off campus in case of an evacuation order. TAPS staff understood that drivers would have to be available 24 hours a day in case an evacuation began in the small hours of the morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had some drivers agreeing to stay overnight in empty dorm rooms so they could hit the ground running should the need arise at a moment&#8217;s notice,&#8221; TAPS Director Dan Henderson said.</p>
<p>Once the campus moved to evacuate, the biggest challenge was making sure each resident was accounted for. Campus police went door to door in the dorms and other housing services, checking up on residents.<br/><br/><strong>Boardwalk, Dining Services care for evacuees</strong><br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz faced another daunting challenge: what convenient, centrally located, and spacious area could serve as a relocation center for evacuated UC Santa Cruz community members?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Seaside Company, owner of the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, agreed to let UC Santa Cruz make use of its Cocoanut Grove Ballroom as an evacuation center with kitchen and dining space so UC Santa Cruz Dining Services could prepare and serve meals to evacuees.</p>
<p>Currently, dining is providing more than 3,000 meals per day including breakfast, lunch, and dinner, for displaced UC Santa Cruz community members as well as other displaced area residents in 20 shelters across the county, said William Prime, executive director of Dining Services.</p>
<p>Prior to the fire, the campus had an arrangement with the county to provide about 1,000 meals a day to various county sites, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. That number has now grown to 3,400 via county shelters.</p>
<p>Additionally, another 300 meals per day are being provided to displaced staff and their families at the University Town Center in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The campus&#8217;s prime food vendor, Performance Foodservice, provided a large refrigerated semi trailer to support dining operations storage needs, Prime said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had volunteers from many campus departments,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The energy of the kitchen has been amazing, and everyone on the team understands the impact our service is providing for our community.&#8221; <br/><br/><strong>Support for the long-term</strong></p>
<p>Recognizing how many employees have been affected by the wildfire, employees in Staff Human Resources began focusing on how they could streamline support services and create new ways to get help. <br/><br/><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/08/support-services-for-employees-impacted-by-wildfires.html">The campus created two hotlines for employees</a> in need, one providing emergency housing assistance and another for general questions. Other forms of help include emergency loans, counseling support, and administrative leave.</p>
<p>Staff Human Resources continues to develop other support programs to help employees.</p>
<p>In addition, the UC Santa Cruz Foundation and Alumni Association came together to form the&#160;<a href="https://2020wildfirerelief.ucsc.edu/">2020 UCSC Wildfire Relief&#160;Fund</a>, which invites donors to contribute to the Slug Support Fund to support students and/or the Wildfire Relief Fund to support faculty and staff.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>'We'll make it through'</strong></p>
<p>Chancellor Larive praised the problem-solving abilities and coordinated work of staff who responded to &#8220;a tragedy that has struck at the heart of our community."<br/><br/>"Facing a fast-moving fire and a volatile situation, our community banded together to make safety the highest priority," Larive said. "Our resilience, and our adaptability, have been tested again and again this year. We've made it through hard times before, and we'll make it through this one."<br/><br/>Larive said that the community response will go far beyond helping displaced people while the fire is still raging. <br/><br/>"Our community support must also extend into the future. We must consider the aftermath: How can we come to the assistance of those who will need alternate living accommodations in the coming months? How can we help displaced employees balance their work and home lives while dealing with the trauma and dislocation of these fires? We must continue to respond to those in need with creativity, heart, and a generous spirit. And, moving forward, we will have to be flexible while keeping in mind our mission and vision for the future.<br/><br/>"So let's help each other. Let's be patient. And let's continue to find ways for Banana Slugs to help one another.&#8221;<br/> <br/><em></em></p>

We both spent time on campus with our teams as they managed the emergency evacuation. That included a visit to those supporting our students who have been relocated to San Jose State, and greeting campus members who evacuated to the beach-area shelter and to the University Town Center. In the middle of so much uncertainty and loss, it was inspiring to see our community come together to help each other. <br/><br/>The latest report from Cal Fire indicates the CZU Lightning Complex fire has consumed nearly 80,000 acres, destroyed 330 structures, and is now, thanks to the continued hard work of Cal Fire and other mutual-aid agencies, 17 percent contained. The fire has not reached campus &#8212; it remains about a mile from our northern boundary &#8212; or the city of Santa Cruz, and Cal Fire has created two fire lines to help protect both. This crisis is not yet over, though, and we must continue to be prepared should the situation change. <br/><br/>While we do not yet know the full extent of the fire damage, it is clear that it will be immense and widespread. UC Santa Cruz employs nearly 5,000 people, and some live in or near the impacted areas. We already know of members of our campus community whose homes have been destroyed in the fire. Hundreds of others have been forced to evacuate, and do not yet know when they will be allowed to return. <br/><br/>To make things easier for those impacted by this fire, and for those who want to help them, today we have launched two new web pages that give those details.<br/><br/>Our <a href="https://status.ucsc.edu/fire/get-help/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">&#8220;How to get help&#8221; page</a> is the place to start for any UC Santa Cruz student or employee impacted by the wildfire who needs help. It includes housing options, which is important, as roughly 77,000 people have been evacuated as a result of this fire.<br/><br/>While this tragedy continues to evolve, many people have asked how they can help. We&#8217;ve tried to answer that question on the new <a href="https://status.ucsc.edu/fire/give-help/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">&#8220;How to give help&#8221; page</a>. While there has been a massive outpouring of material support &#8212; and items still needed are listed on the page &#8212; the best way to directly help those impacted by the fire is through a donation to the disaster-relief fund championed by the UC Santa Cruz Foundation and the Alumni Association. There is a <a href="https://2020wildfirerelief.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">link to donate</a> on the &#8220;How to give help&#8221; page. You can choose whether your donation goes toward students or employees. Already the response has been tremendous, with close to $80,000 raised. <br/><br/>In the meantime, we continue to keep a close eye on the status of the fire, and are regularly updating our <a href="https://status.ucsc.edu/fire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fire web page</a>, which includes updates on to the status of campus operations; information about resources; links to external fire information; as well as links to the &#8220;How to give help&#8221; and &#8220;How to get help&#8221; pages.<br/><br/>Many have asked when Cal Fire will lift the evacuation order for the campus. We will share that information as soon as we receive it from Cal Fire. We still face air-quality issues and other possible impacts. In response to COVID-19, buildings were being fully ventilated with outdoor air. At this time, we do not know the impact of poor air quality inside our facilities. Also, to reduce fire risk to campus, many utilities and building functions were curtailed for the evacuation. Returning those required functions will take time.<br/><br/>Thank you for your caring and for your commitment to each other. Together we can ensure that those impacted by the fire stay well, stay safe, and stay connected.<br/><br/>Cindy and Lori</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz staff, faculty and students </audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive and Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2767b1248072701763b3cba66183e847"><name>shr-employee-hotline-and-resources</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>SHR Employee Hotline and Resources</title><summary>As our community continues to grapple with the ongoing wildfire threat to our campus, homes, and physical safety, we are providing additional resources to staff for the weeks ahead.

<p dir="ltr"><span>I have <a href="images/declaration-of-emergency-update.pdf">amended the Aug. 20 emergency declaration</a> so that employees who live at Laureate Court, Hagar Court, Ranch View Terrace, Hagar Meadow, and Cardiff Terrace can return to their homes tonight. The rest of the residential campus </span><strong>remains closed</strong><span>, as do the Coastal Science Campus and Westside Research Park.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We know everyone is eager to return to campus, whether it&#8217;s for student housing, to conduct research, or to provide on-site services. We are eager too, but must first ensure all pieces are in place for our community to begin returning to these sites. Closing the residential campus last week required us to shut down several critical systems, including our cogeneration plant, our natural gas systems, and other basic infrastructure. They must be returned safely online before the campus is fully repopulated.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Additionally, parts of upper campus, including Family Student Housing, remain without power, and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. is not sure when power will be restored. We will continue to provide updates in the days and weeks ahead.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span></span><strong>Except for the people living in the employee housing communities outlined above, no one should attempt to access the residential campus, Coastal Science Campus, or Westside Research Park until directed that it is OK to do so.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We are optimistic that we will very soon be able to re-open our Coastal Science Campus and Westside Research Park. With the Cal Fire order lifted, we are working hard to ensure our residential communities are ready to welcome back the students that were forced to evacuate.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Reopening the residential campus will be deliberate and phased. Everything will be done to support the health and well-being of our community, and in a way that helps to minimize the spread of COVID-19.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We are immediately focused on restoring critical campus infrastructure, allowing employees and families to return to campus housing, and resuming services provided by our COVID-19 diagnostic lab and our Student Health Center.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>With Cal Fire lifting evacuation orders for several areas, people should anticipate traffic congestion and limited visibility due to smoke. I encourage us all to be patient and kind, particularly in these moments of collective stress.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Faculty and staff should be ready to show their campus or other ID to enter employee housing communities and should exercise caution when returning to their homes, especially if they do so after dark. I encourage you to visit one of the following sites about who to contact and tips for returning home following a wildfire:</span></p>

</ul>
<p>While we are fortunate the wildfire never reached our residential campus, the ash and smoke it created entered our buildings, requiring that we assess and clean some areas of campus before they can be reopened.</p>
<p>In the coming days, we expect to allow research labs approved under our COVID-19 restrictions and some student housing to reopen, and that dining services will resume preparing meals at our residential campus. As a reminder you can find consistent updates at ucsc.edu/fire.<span>Our community has shown exceptional strength and compassion in the face of great adversity. We are beginning the long road of recovering from this wildfire. I know we will emerge a more resilient and close-knit campus and community.&#160;</span></p>

Exactly how to do this is the interesting scientific question we aim to answer,&#8221; explained Walker, who directs UCSC&#8217;s graduate program in Natural Language Processing.<br/><br/>Flanigan is also an expert in natural language processing, which focuses on the development of computer programs that can understand, generate, and learn from human language. &#8220;The UCSC team will develop new algorithms for deep semantic language understanding that are needed to take conversational agents to the next level,&#8221; he said.<br/><br/>Over the course of the project, the AI Partner will evolve from a simple voice software agent to a fully embodied situated dialogue agent. Ultimately, the institute aims to develop AI partners that can observe, participate in, and facilitate collaborative STEM learning conversations by interacting naturally through speech, gesture, gaze, and facial expression in real-world classrooms and remote learning settings.<br/><br/>The institute&#8217;s research efforts will focus on three main challenges. First, researchers will work to develop new advances in the fundamental science of how machines process human language, gestures, and emotions. Next, the team will strive to better understand how students, AI, and teachers can collaborate effectively in both classrooms and remote learning contexts. Finally, researchers will go to classrooms in Denver Public Schools and other school partners&#8212;virtually, during the age of COVID-19&#8212;and work hand-in-hand with students and teachers to think up new technologies.<br/><br/>The UCSC team will be responsible for research and development of new methods in the areas of dialogue management and natural language understanding and generation for multi-party conversation in the context of small-group collaborative learning. To enable this work, they will help design classroom experiments to collect data and participate in data analysis, as well as annotation and preparation of the data for use in training models for the AI Partner.<br/><br/>In addition to UC Santa Cruz, partners in the institute include UC Berkeley, Colorado State University, Brandeis University, Worcester Polytechnic University, Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and University of Wisconsin-Madison.<br/><br/>The NSF AI Institute for Student-AI Teaming is one of five new NSF institutes to advance artificial intelligence research, announced together with two new AI institutes funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These institutes will leverage AI techniques to address pressing issues such as extreme weather preparedness, bioengineering technology, navigation, education, and robust food systems.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/12/nlp-degree.html</url><title>UC Santa Cruz launches new graduate program in natural language processing</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="31e61b938072701763b3cba67d82bf7d"><name>resumption-of-operations-at-select-locations</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Resumption of Operations at Coastal Science Campus, Westside Research Park; emergency declaration modified</title><summary>Based on the latest conditions, I am modifying further the campus emergency declaration.

Though we are now entering the recovery phase of our wildfire response, we know the road ahead will be a long one. While many of our Banana Slugs are facing loss and uncertainty, we have witnessed members of our UC Santa Cruz community step up and step forward to lift each other up and provide support. This has provided much needed light and hope. The very best of who we are continues to show.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC faculty and staff</audience><admin>Sarah Latham, Vice Chancellor Business and Administrative Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="35e8af418072701763b3cba6fea993f2"><name>chancellor-fall-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Adapting our fall housing plans</title><summary>Chancellor Cynthia Larive update</summary><start-date>1598598000000</start-date><display-name>Chancellor fall update</display-name><path>/2020/08/chancellor-fall-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/08/chancellor-fall-update</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1598632275753</created-on><last-modified-by>jchafin</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662575059867</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-MOnEOOT5m8" width="560"></iframe></embed><width>560</width><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Late last week, the wildfire sweeping through the Santa Cruz Mountains forced us to evacuate campus, a first in our 55-year history. My thoughts are with all who have been affected by this fire and the others burning in the state.</p>
<p>The fire thankfully never reached our residential campus, but our community has been greatly affected. The fire has destroyed hundreds of homes, which is exacerbating our local housing crisis as families affected by the fire try to find new places to live. With so much impact on our planning for fall, we can only accommodate a small number of students and are encouraging everyone to spend fall quarter at their current residence, if possible. We are eager to welcome you back to Santa Cruz when we have recovered from this wildfire. Students who have applied for campus housing will be contacted directly today by email to help them determine their best course of action. If you have questions about housing, contact <a href="mailto:housing@ucsc.edu">housing@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Our campus is not the only thing that makes UC Santa Cruz special. It's also our extraordinary students, faculty, and staff. Our team is at work right now to bring you the best of the student experience come fall.</p>
<p>Stay safe, stay well, and stay connected. And remember that wherever you are, you&#8217;re still a Banana Slug.</p>

<p>I am pleased to report that another phase of buildings has been cleared to resume operations, and I am modifying further the <a href="images/modfified-emergency-declaration-v31.pdf">campus emergency declaration</a>. Effective immediately, the following areas of campus have been cleared to resume operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biomedical Building</li>
<li>Cowell College Dining Facility (not open for in-person dining, only meal preparation for the county and evacuees)</li>
<li>Early Education Services</li>
<li>Molecular Diagnostic Lab for COVID-19 testing and Sinsheimer Laboratories</li>
<li>Provost Houses: Merrill, Oakes, and Porter Provost Houses - note that other residential areas in these colleges have not yet been released for repopulation</li>
<li>Student Health Services</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some very important things to remember as we resume operations in these locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reopened locations may only resume operations that were in effect on Aug. 20, 2020, prior to campus emergency declaration and had been approved through the COVID-19 resumption process.</li>
<li>Air quality remains a concern due to wildfires in the area. We continue to track air quality, and will utilize the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZHxoXZL-NuR6SAZjkrHSP3ISewrkXGbF/view">UC guidance for addressing air quality</a> to inform any subsequent actions we need to take. Although air quality tests have been completed throughout campus and may be at acceptable levels, there still may be smoke odor in or around buildings. Should your department need assistance with mitigating the smoke odor, please contact <a href="https://ehs.ucsc.edu/contact/index.html">EH&amp;S staff</a> and they will assist you.</li>
<li><strong>Unless you are heading to one of the buildings that has been cleared for resumption, do not attempt to access campus.&#160;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We continue to ensure that students who were living on campus and evacuated are supported and have a place to stay while we work to reopen student housing. Family Student Housing, which receives power from a different grid than the rest of the campus, remains without electricity. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. has not given us a timeline for when power will be restored.</p>
<p>Campus teams continue their work to get other facilities cleared of smoke and ash, and I am appreciative of all their hard work, both in times of emergency and during our regular operations.</p>
<p>The health and wellbeing of our campus is most important, and we will only reopen buildings after they have been cleared by the Campus Fire Marshal, Environmental Health and Safety (EH&amp;S), and our Physical Plant Department.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience as we work through the stages of operational recovery. We will continue to update you as additional buildings are cleared to open.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s when the pair and their two teammates, Jennifer Hemmen and Steven Lenhart, stepped onto the rugged Fijian island of Ovalau, where a 12-mile trek through thick and unforgiving jungle awaited&#8212;all part of a grueling, 11-day, 416-mile adventure race called Eco-Challenge Fiji, which creators billed as &#8220;The World&#8217;s Toughest Race.&#8221; A 10-episode series on the event is now streaming on Amazon Prime.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thick green foliage and suffocating heat pressed down on the foursome so it felt like they were hiking through a steam room. Soon, Gravlin began feeling the effects of heat exhaustion: extreme fatigue, dizziness, heavy sweating. He could barely stumble forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s when his teammates jumped in. They shouldered his pack and kept reminding him to drink water, remembered the 39-year-old Gravlin (Stevenson &#8217;03, sociology).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They said, &#8216;You set the pace, we&#8217;ve got you.&#8217; They gave me so much positive reinforcement to get my spirits up and moving again. They were the biggest factor in overcoming self-doubt when my body wasn&#8217;t functioning like it was supposed to,&#8221; Gravlin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a lesson both Gravlin and Smith said they&#8217;d first learned while on the swim team at UC Santa Cruz under the direction of former coach Kim Musch: the value of grinding forward even when you wanted to quit and the importance of having a supportive team around you, which, they said, included not only their Slug teammates but the entire athletic department at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed Team Curl for the fact Smith, Gravlin, and their two other teammates all have curly hair, the group eventually finished that nightmarish jungle hike, going on to face close to 200 more hours of sleep-deprived and sometimes dangerous undertakings: climbing waterfall-sprayed cliffs, mountain biking mud-choked hills, rafting whitewater rapids, and scrambling up boulder-strewn river canyons. At one point they even had to assemble their own bamboo rafts, called bilibilis, and paddle 15 hours down a slow-moving river. Once, a monsoon stopped the entire race.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It helps you grow as a human,&#8221; Smith, 37 (Stevenson &#8217;04, psychology), said of the experience. &#8220;It&#8217;s part of the challenge of enduring and embracing discomfort. There&#8217;s something primal about it, a powerful way of looking inward and challenging the human spirit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s hard, but I like to say: When you can&#8217;t get out of it, get into it. Embrace the moment and move forward.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Gravlin, now a senior recruiter for Wavestaff executive recruiting in Aptos, who gathered the team. Smith, who teaches bike-technology classes at several local high schools and is an adventurer who&#8217;s not only done bike endurance races but has hiked the 2,650-mile length of the Pacific Crest trail, cycled the Andes, and kayaked in Norway, was Gravlin&#8217;s first pick.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once they were accepted as one of the race&#8217;s 66 international teams, they began training and figuring out logistics: how much food to bring, what gear to take. Gravlin trained with Outrigger Santa Cruz and CrossFit Santa Cruz and regularly did hiking laps on the breath-stealing Miramar Street hill near his home. Smith, who was the team navigator, entered a few orienteering races and did some long hikes and rides. Both joked, half-seriously, that the most important part of their training was the fact they each had new babies at home and so were used to going without sleep.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The race, with its $100,000 prize, was divided into five legs with a camp at the end of each leg where Team Curl refueled mostly on rice, beans, and quesadillas (Smith is vegan) and planned what equipment they would need for the next section of the race. They consumed 5,000-6,000 calories a day and slept in snatches, 15 minutes here and 90 minutes there&#8212;maybe a total of 20 hours over the 11 days, Smith estimated.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A filmer was embedded with Team Curl to capture their ups and downs, painting them in the TV series as a happy-go-lucky crew of surfers, which was mostly true, according to the men. Early on, they said, they&#8217;d realized they wouldn&#8217;t be able to compete with the professional teams in the race, so they simply decided to embrace the experience, savor the beauty of Fiji and the friendliness of its inhabitants, and do their best to beat the cut-off times that could knock them out of the event.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For the most part, we were just stoked to be out there,&#8221; Gravlin said, although there were moments that were pretty much impossible to be stoked about, like the time they got lost at night in rough terrain or when too little sleep and not enough food strained team dynamics.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, they said, it was incredible to realize what the body is capable of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We all live in this very comfortable and safe bubble that we have created for ourselves,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not until you push the edges of that, that you really start to see how you respond to adversity.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s surprising at times what comes up and what comes out as you look inward and do this really fine dance between pain and exploration. You realize: Man, we can do far more than we give ourselves credit for,&#8221; Smith said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next Eco-Challenge race will be in Patagonia in 2021. Gravlin and Smith have already sent in their application.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="46eb7ed48072701763b3cba6e1017e09"><name>college-ten-profile-story</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>John R.

Lewis College students take on social justice issues while pushing for positive growth and progress in society</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John R. Lewis College students believe in speaking up and taking action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They do not back down from difficult topics that some people would rather not discuss, but instead engage in open dialogues about the most pressing social injustices of our time, including racism, poverty, and violence.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These young scholars don&#8217;t just &#8220;talk it out&#8221;&#8212;they also believe that educating themselves and taking action is the only way to make change.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our students are so passionate,&#8221; said College Nine and John R. Lewis College CoCurricular Programs Coordinator Erin Ramsden. &#8220;They are willing to stand up for what they believe in. Because of the focus on community, this passion is not isolating. Instead, students are focused on educating each other in compassionate and understanding ways that value relationships.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>A culture of social activism&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Located at the heart of campus, John R. Lewis College backs up to a tranquil redwood forest, with access to mountain biking, hiking, and jogging trails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although John R. Lewis College is the newest addition to the UC Santa Cruz residential college system, its vibrant and passionate student culture does not go unrecognized. John R. Lewis College students are an active group, incorporating the motto, &#8220;Justice for all,&#8221; in both their academic and personal lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students appreciate the campus&#8217;s longstanding tradition of multidisciplinary thinking and problem solving. John R. Lewis College affiliates take courses outside of their fields of study to further their knowledge and perspectives. They also learn the value of a nurturing community that encourages open dialogue in and out of the classroom.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many students find this blend of community, activism, and critical analysis inspiring. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent graduate Jon Coelho (John R. Lewis College &#8216;20, legal studies and politics) had such a positive and meaningful experience on the John R. Lewis College campus that he ended up living there for all four years of college.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I found friends and community with similar interests that challenged me to engage in critical dialogues about society and history, supported me, and made me feel like I belonged,&#8221; Coelho said.</span></p>
<p><strong>Involvement: A common denominator at John R. Lewis College</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social justice is part of the John R. Lewis College culture. Students can take advantage of events, programs, and organizations that embody this spirit, from Multicultural Weekend to Teaching Social Justice Workshop.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, a curious student will attend an inspiring event that leads to a deeper involvement with campus initiatives and organizations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annika Duquet (John R. Lewis College &#8216;21, psychology, education minor) found her inspiration at the Multicultural Community Weekend (MCW), which celebrates the diverse backgrounds of community members. The two-day event helped Duquet find her footing at John R. Lewis College.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eager to engage with the college community, she started planning and facilitating events for the CoCurricular Programs Office (CoCo), an organization created by College Nine and John R. Lewis College to foster students&#8217; exploration of both colleges&#8217; themes through experiential learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was able to connect with others in the John R. Lewis College community, make lasting friendships, and put myself in the shoes of other people to learn from their experiences,&#8221; Duquet said.</span></p>
<p><strong>Social justice training</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At John R. Lewis College, interested students can receive on-the-ground training that helps them become effective social activists. The Students for Social Justice (S4SJ) organization explores social justice issues while building community and leadership skills. Through activities, discussions, and events, participants learn to identify and combat injustice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to the goals behind S4SJ, the Teaching for Social Justice Workshop brings students together in small cohorts to explore the themes of John R. Lewis College and learn how to deepen their community involvement.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students also have a chance to volunteer their services through PRAXIS, a club for students to participate in community volunteer work, housed under the Apprenticeship in Community-Engaged Research [(H)ACER] program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PRAXIS students undertake day-long service efforts with local nonprofit organizations, such as Second Harvest Food Bank, Santa Cruz Homeless Services Center, and Habitat for Humanity, to name a few.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students also have a socially conscious alternative to getting sunburned on some overcrowded beach during spring break. Instead, they can choose an &#8220;Alternative Spring Break&#8221; (ASB)&#8212;another program housed under the efforts of (H)ACER&#8212;where they work with local organizations centered on educational equity and environmental and economic justice in Watsonville.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the winter quarter, ASB students attend a panel of Watsonville leaders and a retreat to learn about social justice issues and ways to bring about social change. For five days during spring break, students engage in a variety of activities, from gardening at Calabasas Elementary School to painting a mural and cooking alongside food entrepreneurs at the El Pajaro CDC&#8217;s Community Kitchen Incubator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During fall and spring quarters, the (H)ACER program offers a unique experience for students to work in an after school, community garden-based enrichment program, where they facilitate activities with third, fourth, and fifth graders at Calabasas Elementary School in Watsonville.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the (H)ACER program offers a suite of classes to undergraduates that focus on critical service learning and community-engaged research methodologies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Classroom-assisted activism</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John R. Lewis College courses provide a rich context for student activism. Flora Lu, college provost, Pepper-Giberson chair, and professor of environmental studies, co-developed one of those essential courses, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transcommunal Peace Making, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">which offered undergraduates an extraordinary learning opportunity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Drawing on the scholarship of Professor Emeritus John Brown Childs and the efforts of Barrios Unidos, the course</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">brought UCSC undergraduates to Soledad Prison to learn with and from incarcerated men who have committed themselves to non-violence and social justice. Students at UCSC and Soledad did the same readings&#8212;which included the writings of MLK Jr. and Indigenous philosophy&#8212;and met multiple times during the quarter to discuss the readings and share their individual experiences,&#8221; Lu said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Courses like this, which bring together faculty and students from across the campus to partner with nonprofits and institutions, represent the kind of innovative learning experiences that are the forte of John R. Lewis College,&#8221; she continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John R. Lewis College students collectively embody the inclusive, empathetic, and change-agent mindset needed to make great strides in fighting social injustice at home and abroad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>&#8220;Our students teach and hold us accountable to not only the concept of social justice, but any movement or issue," said Sarah Woodside Bury, Colleges Nine and John R. Lewis College senior director for college student life.</span> "We are constantly learning and growing along with them, and through that iterative process, we are trying to even more truly and fully embody our theme.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="d730626180727017605850f70a5afd65"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2020/08/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/08/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1575568302665</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1575568302665</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
