University Library at UC Santa Cruz announced today the&#160;</span><span>online publication of the <strong><i>Santa Cruz County Historic Photograph Collection</i></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Consisting of more than 10,000 images, the collection documents over a century of Santa Cruz County history, featuring original photographs and copy prints from 1866 to 1995.</span></p>
<p><span>The photographs portray the county&#8217;s rich history in agriculture, tourism, industry and culture. Highlights of the collection include photographs of the world famous Santa Cruz Boardwalk and Casino and other attractions that have made this area a popular tourist destination for generations--plus an extensive array of images depicting Santa Cruz&#8217;s booming film industry in the early part of the 20th century.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The collection also reveals a portrait of the daily lives of Santa Cruz residents over the years and where they lived, worked and played. While the majority of photographs document the city of Santa Cruz, there are also many photos of the North and South county as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>"As memory institutions, libraries are key in preserving history&#160;and making it as accessible as possible,&#8221; noted University Librarian Elizabeth Cowell. &#8220;In this instance&#8212;the work to preserve&#160;and share&#160;our unique local history&#8212;the power and importance of this role is clear.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>The main source for the photographs in the collection is Preston Sawyer, a local historian, journalist, photographer, and collector of Santa Cruz memorabilia, who was born in Santa Cruz in 1899. In his youth, he worked as an extra for a number of movies filmed in the Santa Cruz area, and as a prolific amateur photographer took hundreds of pictures of actors, directors, film crews, and locations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Sawyer used his own photographs, along with those he collected, to accompany a weekly feature, &#8220;Santa Cruz Yesterdays,&#8221; that he wrote for more than a decade in the <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i>. After Sawyer&#8217;s death in 1968, UCSC acquired his photographs.</span></p>
<p><span>Other local photographers and studios represented in the collection include Charles (C.L.) Aydelotte, C. Aichberg, Alice Halsey, Kroughs, McKean and Ort, Ole Ravnos, Reese, W.H. Sherer, George Webb, and the Wicklund Studio.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;This collection is a boon to local historians, genealogists and amateur researchers,&#8221; noted Teresa Mora, head of Special Collections &amp; Archives at the UCSC Library.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;It provides unique insights into various aspects of Santa Cruz history, as well as a better and deeper understanding of how the Santa Cruz of today came to be,&#8221; she added.</span></p>
<p><span>The <strong><i><a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/santa-cruz-photos">Santa Cruz County Historic Photograph Collection</a></i></strong> can be searched and viewed as part of the UCSC Library&#8217;s Digital Collections. Detailed information about the collection is also available in the finding aid included in the Online Archive of California.</span><span></span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e540acc2807270177ac7b973ff01779c"><name>new-faculty</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New faculty build on campus strengths</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz is welcoming 43 new faculty members to campus this academic year.

<p>The problem? The UCSC shirt she ordered off Amazon never arrived.</p>
<p>"I was really bummed, and I wanted to show people how proud I was that I got into UC Santa Cruz," Moges said.</p>
<p>Moges leaned into her artistic side, buying a white sweater and painting her own UC Santa Cruz shirt with a redwood tree and sunset over Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz students, like Moges, are excited to start their college journey, despite the challenges created by a global pandemic that has reshaped society. Faculty and staff are ready to provide students with the best experience possible and the support to help them succeed.</p>
<p>Moges grew up in San Jose, and UC Santa Cruz emerged as an obvious choice when she decided to pursue a degree in computer science.</p>
<p>"I've always loved UC Santa Cruz. The first time I visited was right after I came to America. My dad was living in San Jose and took us to the beach," said Moges, who left Ethiopia when she was 8 years old. "I want to take what I learn at UC Santa Cruz and use it to help countries, like Ethiopia."</p>
<p>Leading up to college, Moges immersed herself in the world of technology with summer internships at Google and Intel. She's started her UCSC journey through the Baskin Engineering Excellence Scholars program, one of many programs the campus offers to give new students the tools and resources necessary to achieve academic excellence throughout their college journey.</p>
<h1>New class underscores excellence, opportunity</h1>
<p>Despite the pandemic, UC Santa Cruz continued its renewed tradition of holding a convocation to recognize the achievement of incoming students and welcome them into the campus community. In a video published Tuesday, Chancellor Cynthia Larive, interim Vice Chancellor Jennifer Baszile, SUA President Shivika Sivakumar, college provosts, resource center directors and the president of the UC Santa Cruz alumni council welcomed new Banana Slugs to their college journey.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz is truly an extraordinary university, offering you myriad opportunities to pursue your passions, whether they be academic or personal,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said today in a welcome message to students. &#8220;The chance to explore new interests and to discover what brings you joy is a huge benefit of a UCSC education.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moges is one of the 4,100 new first-year Banana Slugs who are starting their college journey this fall. The campus is welcoming an additional 1,700 transfer students who are continuing their higher education with UCSC.</p>
<p>Thirty one percent of new students (frosh and transfers) are first-generation college students, and 31% of undergrads (new and returning) are from low-income backgrounds. Many have traveled a long way to get here with first-year students hailing from 44 states and 31 different countries.</p>
<p>The racial and ethnic diversity of incoming students continues to be strong. Five percent of incoming first-year students identify as African American, 1% as American Indian, 36% as Asian, 27% as Hispanic/Latino, and 29% as white. Five percent of incoming transfer students identify as African American, 1.4% as American Indian, 26% as Asian, 30% as Hispanic/Latino, and 33% as white, according to preliminary campus figures.</p>
<h1>New faculty and programs build on campus strengths</h1>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is welcoming <a href="new-faculty.xml">43 faculty members</a> to campus this academic year. Areas of expertise include biology, computer science and engineering, psychology, feminist studies, and much more. UC Santa Cruz now has 620 Senate faculty members spread across its five academic divisions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faculty are really the backbone of the university, and we are strong throughout all five of our academic divisions,&#8221; said Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer, who is the university&#8217;s top academic officer. &#8220;This year&#8217;s hires, which includes our first Nobel Laureate, are fantastic additions, expanding opportunities for our students and boosting our research profile.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz launched several new programs this fall that build on the campus&#8217;s strengths and offer students new opportunities.</p>
<p>A bachelor of arts in biotechnology is designed for students who plan to be involved in the biotechnology industry as writers, artists, ethicists, executives, sales force, regulators, lawyers, and other roles. It will give them an understanding of the technology without the intensive training needed for technicians, research scientists, engineers, and bioinformaticians.</p>
<p>A new Black Studies minor offers students grounding in the intellectual histories, political movements, cultural expressions, and critical theories of the black diaspora. With faculty expertise in Africa, the Caribbean, the Americas, Europe, and the Pacific, students can explore the globally multi-sited nature of black freedom struggles, both past and present, and examine blackness through a comparative lens.</p>
<p>The Environmental Studies Department launched a BA in agroecology that will provide students with an understanding of the social, political, and economic aspects of agriculture.</p>
<p>Other new programs include a B.A. in mathematics education and a B.S. in mathematics, and a B.A. in Education, Democracy and Justice.</p>
<p>The Natural Language Processing masters degree at the Silicon Valley Campus is welcoming its first cohort of students.</p>
<h1>Living, learning in a pandemic</h1>
<p><img alt="sammy-mask-300px.jpg" height="400" src="images/sammy-mask-300px.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 10px 5px 10px;" width="300"/>The health and wellbeing of the campus community continues to be one of the highest priorities for UC Santa Cruz. The campus planned fall activities to help limit the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>In addition to continuing with remote instruction, the campus dramatically reduced the number of students living on campus and encouraged students to live at their permanent residence, if possible. About 1,000 students will be living on campus for fall quarter, down from about 9,000 in previous years.</p>
<p>A Slug Strong public awareness campaign, launched last week, encourages everyone in the campus community to do their part by wearing a face covering, avoiding group gatherings, and more. All students living on campus will also receive regular tests for COVID-19 as part of the campus&#8217;s asymptomatic testing effort to help prevent the virus's spread.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e5ddbcec807270177ac7b9735220d981"><name>celebrating-the-start-of-the-academic-year</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Celebrating the start of the academic year</title><summary>Hello colleagues, and welcome to the start of a unique academic year.

Our UC Santa Cruz community is more spread out this quarter than years past, but do not let that temper your excitement for the start of this new chapter for our university and for our students.<br/><br/>Thousands of people across UC Santa Cruz have been working tirelessly the past few months to ensure a fall quarter that is as smooth and welcoming as possible. Together we&#8217;ve tackled everything from establishing COVID-testing protocols to admitting a new class of Banana Slugs to deciding how best to deliver robust and engaging remote instruction. Our commitment to excellent teaching, innovative research, and meaningful public service has not dipped during this global pandemic. That is because of all of your efforts.&#160;<br/><br/>We understand the added challenges many staff and faculty face right now, with many juggling both work and child-care duties from home. Throw in a wildfire that personally impacted so many of you, and we honestly sit in awe of university employees. We want you all to know as we start the new academic year that we are deeply grateful for your commitment to this university, to your colleagues, and ultimately to our students. You are the backbone of UC Santa Cruz and you are so appreciated.<br/><br/>Together we are making a positive difference. For the second consecutive year, UC Santa Cruz has been ranked among the&#160;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/09/usnwr-rankings.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">top five universities in the nation for student social mobility</a>. This ranking recognizes universities for their success in enrolling and graduating students from low-income households. We are excited to see our campus recognized, proud of our students, and grateful to all who support them during their time at UCSC.<br/><br/>As you know, the fall quarter will look different this year. You may have noticed the op-ed &#160;published in the Santa Cruz Sentinel this past weekend, which then ran in this week&#8217;s Tuesday Newsday. It sketches out&#160;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/09/what-fall-will-look-like-on-campus.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">what the start of this year will look like</a>, with nearly all instruction remote and just a fraction of the students we typically have living on campus. Our reopening approach is among the most conservative in the nation. We are taking this approach because we care about your well-being and the welfare of the greater community.&#160;<br/><br/>Earlier this week, we sent new students a&#160;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIdVakBUazM&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="noopener" target="_blank">convocation video</a>. It was created to celebrate the start of their academic journeys at UC Santa Cruz. This time of year is always energizing, but when we saw the finished version of this video, it felt like an extra jolt! We are a special university, and it's the people, not the place, that make it special. Please take a look if you have a chance.<br/><br/>We will communicate regularly to keep you updated on UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s plans for the future, but in the meantime, thank you again for your patience, optimism, and resolve as we begin the new academic year.&#160;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz faculty and staff</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive and Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e68a92fb807270177ac7b973473fb4e0"><name>update-on-covid-19-planning-testing</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Update on COVID-19 planning and testing</title><summary>Whether you are physically on campus or working, teaching and learning remotely, we want to ensure you are updated on the latest campus COVID-19 planning efforts.</summary><start-date>1601593200000</start-date><display-name>Update on COVID-19 planning and testing</display-name><path>/2020/10/update-on-covid-19-planning-testing</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/10/update-on-covid-19-planning-testing</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1601595675349</created-on><last-modified-by>jchafin</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662575249540</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>After months of preparation, we are excited that the fall quarter has officially begun.

This emphasized participating in the asymptomatic testing program.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Participation in the asymptomatic testing program is a cornerstone to our campus recovery and resiliency plans. It is a key element to our ability to detect potential outbreaks early. Best practices include frequent testing, immediate intervention for positive cases including contact tracing and isolation of individuals who have tested positive for the virus. These practices are especially important in locations that have large residential communities with shared facilities. Our campus asymptomatic testing approach is outlined below. Note that population requirements and frequencies are subject to change as conditions and/or state and local guidance changes.&#160;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Where possible, reduce prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors, consider staying inside, and keep windows and doors closed during times of heavy smoke. Most occupied campus buildings have been adjusted to maximize the amount of outdoor air as part of the COVID risk minimization strategy. Unfortunately, this has the side effect of bringing more smoke into the buildings. Contact your supervisor or manager if you need to work remotely due to smoke levels in your building.&#160;&#160;</span></p>

To date we have been working with a core group of students, faculty, and staff. We want to get feedback on what we&#8217;ve developed and continue the conversation. Our goal is to design experiences that can fulfill the vision for the building:</p>
<p><strong><i>The new IIRB prioritizes equity and inclusion by demystifying &amp; diversifying scientific instruction and student research and inviting students to create their own scientific identities and be at home in the sciences.</i></strong></p>
<p>We will be holding four virtual &#8220;feedback fairs&#8221; to capture your input. Please stop by our virtual workshop space on zoom and see what fellow UCSC students, faculty, and staff have developed, even if you just have 5 minutes! These are drop in sessions with a range of activities to get your feedback on the types of experiences that will drive the design for the new building. There are four sessions for different types of students. We encourage you to join the one that aligns most with your identity and experience.&#160;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Kresge College, traditionally a college focused on media studies and media literacy, hosts the curriculum for City on a Hill Press, and regularly collaborates with the departments of Film and Digital Media, Games and Playable Media, the University Library, and Feminist Studies.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Kresge&#8217;s programs and student organizations including the Kresge Parliament, four student cooperatives, and the Common Ground Center have historically emphasized participatory democracy and consensus-based approaches to building community. The Kresge College staff, student leaders, and faculty strive to cultivate that approach with student-directed seminars. Notably this fall&#8217;s indigenous and trans-focused UCSC Arboretum Apprenticeship Program and traditional courses that emphasize student leadership including a core course that concludes with "Creative Interventions"&#8212;a unit dedicated to fostering student collaboration and thoughtful activism. Kresge College is also the annual host of a campus PRIDE celebration.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The initial review date for the position is Friday, November 6, 2020. Applications should be sent directly to me at <a href="mailto:rph@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rph@ucsc.edu</a>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>College provosts are key campus scholar-administrators focused on the academic programs of their college, alumni connections, faculty community, and a multitude of other issues. Provost positions include release from half of their teaching load, a stipend, and summer salary. This position will begin July 1, 2021 and has a three-year appointment. Please feel free to contact me or a current or past provost, to discuss this position.</span></p>

<p>The SCGSR Program provides supplemental funds for graduate awardees to conduct part of their thesis research at a DOE national laboratory.</p>
<p>Cherrette works in the laboratory of Jin Zhang, distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and will use the award to conduct part of her research at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in Berkeley. Her research project involves quantum information science for experimental condensed matter physics.</p>
<p>&#8220;These graduate student awards help prepare new scientists for STEM careers that are vitally important to the DOE mission and the nation&#8217;s economy,&#8221; said Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette. &#8220;We are proud of the accomplishments of these outstanding awardees and look forward to seeing what they achieve in the years to come. They represent the future leadership and innovation that will allow American science and engineering to excel in the 21st century.&#8221;</p>
<p>The research projects are expected to advance the graduate awardees&#8217; overall doctoral research and training while providing access to the expertise, resources, and capabilities available at the DOE laboratories. Awardees were selected from a diverse pool of university-based graduate applicants. Selection was based on merit peer review by external scientific experts.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loyal Banana Slugs banded together to make the fifth annual Giving Day a resounding success this year, raising more than $600,000 for worthy causes and demonstrating the campus community&#8217;s strong commitment to philanthropy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emily Denning Todd, associate director of annual and digital giving for UC Santa Cruz, pronounced the day a great achievement.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Alumni, faculty/staff, students, retirees/emeriti, and friends all came together on the day before classes to give our students a hopeful beginning to a challenging year," she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the pandemic created a few logistical challenges, including a four-month postponement and a pivot to an all-online format, this was one of the most successful Giving Days since the inception of this high-octane, 24-hour online event of giving in 2016.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fundraiser hinges on peer-to-peer outreach, a strong sense of social responsibility, and the good-natured spirit of teams trying to outdo each other to win bonus challenge dollars. The end result is a formula for success. The 4,732 gifts this year will support more than 130 programs and activities across the campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This year&#8217;s&#160; results are a testament to the extraordinary programs and initiatives that are occurring across the campus as well as the hard work that goes into Giving Day by all of the teams," said Vice Chancellor for University Relations Mark Delos Reyes Davis. &#8220;It was an amazing way to demonstrate to our incoming students what a remarkable community they are joining.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of this year&#8217;s Giving Day supporters previously gave to the campus to support </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the </span><a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/o/university-of-california---santa-cruz/i/ucsc-giving-day-2020/s/covid-19-response-fund"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 Response Fund, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">which helps fund critical research at the Molecular Diagnostic Lab, where researchers have implemented a testing process on campus that identifies active COVID-19 cases; and the </span><a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/o/university-of-california---santa-cruz/i/ucsc-giving-day-2020/s/2020-wildfire-relief"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 Wildfire Relief Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which supports those in the campus community affected by disasters like the recent wildfires. Both fundraisers were later folded into Giving Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As with everything during COVID-19, we weren't sure how things would turn out,&#8221; Davis said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t clear if the day before classes was a good time or if we were asking too much of our donors after the COVID and Wildfire campaigns.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the end result was a gift inundation.&#160;</span></p>
<p>&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">A variety of exciting challenges kept the adrenaline flowing throughout the day-long event. The All-Day Challenge offered a total of $11,000 of additional funding to the three groups with the highest number of unique donors throughout the whole day.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The highest performer in that competition was </span><a href="https://recreation.ucsc.edu/adventure/nik.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empowering Student Leadership: The Nik Madsen Memorial Endowment for Whole Heart Leadership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with 229 donors. Because of this impressive turnout, the team received a $7,000 fundraising bonus. Empowering Student Leadership earned a total of $34,000, including the bonus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nik Madsen Memorial Endowment for Whole Heart Leadership</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was created in 2018 to support leadership development among UC Santa Cruz Adventure Rec, which provides the campus community with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">outdoor, recreational, and hands-on learning experiences.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year featured the Mid-Day Motivator, funded by Chancellor Cynthia Larive and her husband, Jim Larive. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three groups with the most unique donors from 12&#8211;2 p.m. were awarded additional funding. Those groups were SACNAS, Empowering Student Leadership, and the </span><a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/o/university-of-california---santa-cruz/i/ucsc-giving-day-2020/s/the-norris-centerbiodiversity-surveys-around-the-monterey-bay"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norris Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic delayed the start of Giving Day, originally scheduled for April 22, and altered the format. COVID-related safety concerns led to an all-online event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But those emergencies also underscored the importance of Giving Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Given the nature of how learning will be conducted during COVID, it is even more important that the programs during Giving Day are supported,&#8221; Todd said.&#160;</span></p>

To address the needs of career and partial year career staff who may have limited work due to decreased campus service levels, UCSC is implementing a temporary redeployment program to manage campus staffing levels through the academic year 2020-2021. The goal of this initiative is to preserve employment for career employees to the fullest extent possible while fulfilling critical campus services and tackling important campus projects.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This week, we are initiating the first step of this process by asking each division principal officer to identify work or projects that could use personnel support. In parallel with this effort, the campus will undertake a strategic service level reduction assessment and, combining these efforts, Staff Human Resources will&#160;work with units who have service level reductions to determine where there are matches between employee skill sets and work project needs. Supervisors and managers should consult with their Employee Relations (ER) Analyst to determine their staffing needs for the coming academic year before taking any action.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Employees in units with limited work who are interested in the program will be invited to complete a Redeployment Interest Form to be considered for available temporary positions in the weeks ahead.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">More details on the program will be shared this week. If there are any immediate questions prior to that, they can be sent to <a href="mailto:elrinfo@ucsc.edu">elrinfo@ucsc.edu</a>. We hope that by being strategic, proactive and creative we can redeploy the talents of our employees as we face the service level reductions resulting from COVID-19.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>We are so pleased about the start of the fall quarter and could not be more grateful as we begin another academic year together. So many people have worked hard to welcome students, propel our research mission, and support high-quality instruction during this unique time.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To help our students, staff and faculty plan for the future, we write to update you about campus plans for winter instruction and housing. We continue to align with county and state guidelines and to prioritize public health and well-being, promote equitable access to education, and commit to high-quality instruction and student support in all of our planning.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Winter instruction</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Much like we did in fall, UC Santa Cruz will continue to offer most courses remotely or online for winter quarter 2021, providing in-person instruction for a small number of courses that may not be effectively delivered remotely, such as some laboratory, studio, field-research and field-study courses. Each course will have the mode of instruction listed within the schedule of courses, available Nov. 13.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This fall, we are hosting six in-person courses on the residential campus and two at our Silicon Valley Campus. Our in-person instruction and learning spaces will remain modified to ensure that we comply with physical distancing and other public health measures. While we expect to have a small increase in in-person courses in the winter quarter, students are still encouraged to live and learn remotely.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Housing and dining</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Those without suitable alternative living arrangements will again be prioritized for Winter quarter on-campus housing. The residential housing and dining experience will remain modified to accommodate current public-health guidance. Additional students may be accommodated, space permitting. More information will be forthcoming from our Colleges, Housing and Educational Services division in the coming weeks.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Students who are taking all courses remotely and who have a safe place to live and learn should still refrain from seeking off-campus housing in Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Student services</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Student Health Services is providing services in person and remotely. Counseling and Psychological Services, Basic Needs support, Learning Support Services, and CARE are all open and providing services remotely. A full list of services and operating hours can be found on the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://recovery.ucsc.edu/support-for-students/campus-services/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1602105163444000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGIQlugapc_lveAbKLiC2lN1zTEIA" href="https://recovery.ucsc.edu/support-for-students/campus-services/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>COVID-19 webpage</span></a><span> and the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/about/resources/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1602105163444000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGf_JQjS81H959ufrWsDXLKAZKVWA" href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/about/resources/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Division of Student Affairs and Success website.</span></a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Planning for a healthy campus&#160;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Faculty and staff who are currently working remotely from home should plan to continue to do so through June 30, 2021. This time period could be shorter if pandemic conditions improve or longer if pandemic conditions worsen, but we want to give you our current projections.</span>&#160;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Reducing the spread of COVID-19 remains a top priority, and we are continuously evaluating how we can best achieve this goal. In collaboration with the campus Molecular Diagnostic Lab, the Cowell Student Health Center has ramped up an asymptomatic testing program for our campus and is also testing students who exhibit symptoms of COVID-19.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Please continue to be diligent about following local, state, and campus public-health mandates. The campus has also instituted protocols to reduce COVID-19 spread on campus, including:</span></p>

Douglass</article-subhead><article-text><p><span>On October 14, the McEvoy Foundation for the Arts in San Francisco will present the West Coast debut of <strong><i>Lessons of the Hour</i></strong>, a moving image and photography exhibition by British filmmaker, installation artist, and UC Santa Cruz distinguished professor of the arts, Isaac Julien.</span></p>
<p><span><i>Lessons</i> explores the life of Frederick Douglass (1818&#8211;1895), a pivotal figure in the history of abolitionism and social reform in the United States. An escaped and then freed slave, the visionary African American writer and statesman developed his oratorical skills as a preacher before embarking on anti-slavery campaigns across the northern United States and the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span>The exhibition is an immersive 10-screen film installation, hung salon-style to create what Julien describes as a &#8220;moving image montage.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span>Shot with 35mm film and 4k digital technology at sites in the United States and United Kingdom that hold historical significance to the abolitionist&#8217;s life, <i>Lessons</i> places Douglass&#8212;portrayed by Ray Fearon, a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company&#8212;within a variety of pastoral, domestic, and public settings.</span></p>
<p><span>Three of Douglass&#8217; historic speeches provide the thematic core of the film, including "Lessons of the Hour" (1894), his final delivered speech, addressing lynching, suffrage, and legacies of slavery in the post-Civil War American South; &#8221;Lecture on Pictures" (1861), in which he draws a connection between advances in photography and equality, and &#8221;What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?" (1852), his most well-known speech offering a pointed critique of American democracy advanced by the condition of slavery.</span></p>
<p><span>Julien also includes contemporary images of drone surveillance and found footage of 20th-century American life that bring Douglass&#8217; timely words into the present.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span><i>Lessons</i> is accompanied by Julien&#8217;s tintype portraits and photographs of the film&#8217;s subjects that explore a shared interest in photography between Douglass and Julien. The most photographed man of the 19th century, Douglass was a prominent proponent of the medium as a means by which Black people could control their likenesses beyond caricature.</span></p>
<p><span>The exhibition also includes complementary works selected by Julien from the McEvoy Family Collection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Acclaimed for his nonlinear</strong> <strong>storytelling</strong> capabilities and the spatial experiences of his installations, Julien has created epic works on subjects ranging from Langston Hughes and the Harlem Renaissance <i>(</i><a href="https://www.isaacjulien.com/projects/looking-for-langston/"><i>Looking for Langston</i></a>, 1989) and relationships between art and capital (<a href="https://www.isaacjulien.com/projects/playtime/"><i>Playtime</i></a>, 2014) to the iconic architect Lina Bo Bardi <i>(</i><a href="https://www.isaacjulien.com/projects/39/"><i>A Marvellous Entanglement</i></a>, 2019).</span></p>
<p><span>Julien is also represented in museum and private collections throughout the world, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Tate, the UK Government Art Collection, Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and the Brandhorst Museum.</span></p>
<p><span>The McEvoy Arts presentation of <i>Lessons</i> was developed in collaboration with the<i> </i><a href="https://www.isaacjulien.com/about/isaac-julien-lab-at-uc-santa-cruz/"><strong><i>Isaac Julien Lab</i></strong></a> at UC Santa Cruz in an effort to give a community of postgraduate students a practicum experience in curation, installation, and production of an immersive moving-image work.

The rights ensured by DACA are critically important, and the ruling helped address some of the confusion swirling for the past two years around our federal government's immigration policies &#8212; confusion that left many of the undocumented members of our campus community unsure of their place here. Not knowing what the future held, not only for them but for their families and friends, was also unsettling.<br/><br/>But keeping DACA intact is not nearly enough. It only provides work authorization for people who came to the United States as children and requires renewal every two years. It does not provide a path to citizenship, and many undocumented people are excluded from DACA and cannot benefit from the legal protections it affords. <br/><br/>We write to let the undocumented members of our community know there is nothing ambiguous about our support for you. We are proud of your efforts, recognize your contributions to campus and to society, and will do all in our power to support you. You do not stand alone. Our campus is built on an ethos of social justice, and nothing is more just than equal access to educational attainment and employment. Our Principles of Community clearly lay out our commitment: We value the strength that the diversity of our campus community brings to our institution. We are committed to due process. We believe deeply in equal opportunity.<br/><br/>The University of California system is equally committed to the rights of all students and employees, regardless of immigration status, and it's important that we all know these rights. The passage of state Assembly Bill 21 in 2017 put several policies and procedures in place regarding immigration enforcement on public campuses.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Below, we've outlined various scenarios, and what to do in each instance.</div>
<br/>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you are advised that an immigration officer is expected to enter, will enter, or has entered the campus to execute an immigration order,</strong> notify Garrett Naiman, Associate Vice Chancellor for Student Development and Engagement, and Dean of Students, as soon as possible. Contact him at 831-502-5009 (available at this number after regular business hours) or via email at <a href="mailto:deanofstudents@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">deanofstudents@ucsc.edu</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Any student, faculty, or staff who has contact with an immigration officer executing a federal immigration order</strong> should refer that individual to our <a href="https://lex.ucsc.edu/who-we-are/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Campus Counsel's Office</a> for purposes of verifying the legality of any warrant, court order, or subpoena. Contact the office at 831-459-1848.</li>
<li><strong>If you are or believe you may be subject to an immigration order or inquiry on campus,</strong> Garrett Naiman is again your best contact. Federal and state education privacy laws protect your records, as he is prohibited from disclosing your education information including immigration status to anyone, except as otherwise required by law. Contact him at 831-502-5009 (available at this number after regular business hours) or via email at deanofstudents@ucsc.edu.</li>
</ul>

It is important to note that federal immigration agencies can and on rare occasions do enter campuses for non-enforcement activities, which can include recruitment and normal visa processing. The procedures detailed above relate only to enforcement activities. <br/><br/>As a final note, this message is being sent so that all members of the community are informed heading into the new academic year. We have no indication that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has any current plans to come to campus for enforcement activities.<br/>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>What will happen?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Last month, we sent an initial simulated phish to capture baseline metrics for UCSC&#8217;s response to phishing attacks. Beginning this month through the 2020-21 academic year, you will receive multiple simulated phishing emails per standard industry best practices. If you click on a link in the simulated phishing email, you won&#8217;t experience any negative consequences. You will be directed to an educational web page designed to help you recognize and respond appropriately to email phishing. Individuals who click on the link </span><span>will not</span><span> be identified.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The purpose of this campaign is education and awareness. The sophisticated nature of next generation phishing is easy to fall for. Google filters out or alerts to suspected spam and phishing emails, but no filter is perfect. Ultimately, it&#8217;s up to you to recognize phishing and know what to do when you encounter it.</span></p>

We know that campus operations have adjusted to fewer students, no in-person events, reduced travel, and a host of other changes in response to COVID-19, and as a result, many units are facing service level impacts and reduction in workload. Over the next two weeks, the campus will be assessing potential service level reduction in each division across campus. In parallel with that effort and to address the needs of career and partial-year career staff who may have limited work due to decreased campus service levels, UC Santa Cruz is implementing a temporary employee redeployment program (ERP) to manage campus staffing levels through the academic year 2020-2021.</span><br/><br/>
<div>The redeployment program has two key components. The first will be to identify the roles and jobs that will be either underutilized, reduced in time, or not needed in the face of the reduced departmental or divisional operating levels. Second, while this strategic assessment occurs, each division will have the opportunity to identify existing staffing needs or projects that can be launched that would enable career or partial-year career staff the opportunity to be redeployed.&#160; As these initiatives run together, by the end of October the campus will be able to understand the full scope of service level reductions as well as potential opportunities for redeployment.
<div><br/>As a campus, we value our employees and would like to support by striving to provide employment options during the uncertain times resulting from the COVID pandemic. For employees who may not have work for the remainder of fall or winter quarter, employees will have the option to participate in this temporary employee redeployment program. Employees that are interested in redeployment will be asked to submit an interest form articulating their skills, knowledge, abilities, and preferred shifts, among other questions. Based on an interest form, SHR will review submissions for individual skills in order to facilitate redeployment matches. Employees may be redeployed through this program for a minimum of 30 days or through June 2021. Opting in to the ERP does not guarantee an employee&#8217;s placement or that a suitable matching temporary job or project will be available.</div>

Started in 2019 by CITRIS and the Banatao Institute in partnership with the Institute for Social Transformation, the program funded four projects and two events in its first year. The deadline for applications for 2020-21 is November 16.</p>
<p>Information and matchmaking sessions for students, as well as for staff and faculty working with students who may be interested, will be held via Zoom on the following dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thursday, October 15, from 9 to 10 a.m. (RSVP at <a href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwtfuChqD0qH9TuJm0MAUgGr-hKMpub3w2o">https://ucsc.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwtfuChqD0qH9TuJm0MAUgGr-hKMpub3w2o</a>)</li>

<li>Thursday, October 22, from 12 to 1 p.m. (RSVP at <a href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwodO-hqD4vHdF-VGuFSpl9NymfdzZBsBjw">https://ucsc.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwodO-hqD4vHdF-VGuFSpl9NymfdzZBsBjw</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The information sessions will walk students through the application process and also provide an opportunity for them to pitch their project and event ideas in order to connect with other students interested in working on the idea. Anyone interested in solving societal challenges, whether they have an idea or not, is encouraged to attend.</p>
<p>The Tech for Social Good program is open to teams of undergraduate students and mixed teams of graduate and undergraduate students (but not teams of graduate students only). It has two competitive tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://citris.smapply.org/prog/2020-2021_ucsc_tech_for_social_good_tech_development_track"><strong>Technology Development Track</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Students can apply for funding of $500 to $5,000 for tech-focused projects that promote social good by supporting healthy, sustainable, prosperous, and equitable livelihoods in the United States and abroad.</li>
<li><a href="https://citris.smapply.org/prog/2020-2021_ucsc_tech_for_social_good_student-led_events"><strong>Events &amp; Programming Track</strong></a><strong>:</strong> UC Santa Cruz individual students, student organizations, or student groups can apply for funding of $200 to $1,000 to develop events or programming that improve and support technological innovations that support healthy, sustainable, and connected communities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Technology track is open to a wide range of projects, from hardware or software solutions addressing a societal challenge to projects that bring an innovative use of a technology (such as a website, social media, or data application) to explore a solution. The Events track is also open to diverse programming, from an actual tech event, like a hackathon, to speakers addressing tech issues or club meetings that explore some element of technology&#8217;s impact on our lives.</p>
<p>Examples of previously funded projects at UCSC and other UC campuses can be found at the following sites:</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Our 2020-2021 winter curtailment will be expanded this year to run from Monday, December 21 through Friday, January 1, 2021. Work is scheduled to resume on Monday, January 4, 2021.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The extra days are intended to provide employees with the flexibility to use as needed in response to the many COVID-19 related impacts we have all experienced. To varying degrees, virtually everyone has been impacted by COVID-19, fires and the normal stress and strain of work. We hope everyone can take the time available to enjoy a healthy and restful holiday period.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Six (6) curtailment days (instead of the traditional three days) plus the four (4) paid holidays will allow most staff to have two (2) full work weeks off of work. Here is the summary of how the ten total days are allocated:</span>&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>December 24, 25, 31 and January 1 are paid university holidays (if eligibility criteria are met)&#160;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>December 21, 22, 23, 28, 29 and 30 are the six (6) curtailment days</span>&#160;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Employees may use vacation, accrued compensatory time off (CTO), COVID-19 UC Expanded Paid Admin Leave or leave without pay (LWOP) for the curtailment days, scheduled for December 21, 22, 23, 28, 29 and 30, 2020. For employees who may not have sufficient accumulated vacation hours, up to six (6) days of vacation leave may be used in advance of actual accrual during the winter curtailment period. Those employees who are normally required to wait six (6) months before using accrued vacation will be allowed to use their vacation hours even if the required waiting period has not been completed.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In addition to employee accruals as described above, for this year only, employees may also use their COVID-19 UC Expanded Paid Admin Leave to cover up to six (6) work days during the curtailment period.&#160;</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In certain cases academic and non-academic employees will be required to work during some or all of this period due to the nature of their jobs. Any employee, regardless of their work location, including remote work, may work only with the explicit approval of their principal officer/designee and supervisor.</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Units planning to maintain operations as usual during the winter curtailment period must receive approval from their respective principal officer or designee and should refer to the "Exceptions to Winter Curtailment" memo that will be coming from Physical Plant. This memo will explain the required procedure to ensure that heat is supplied to appropriate working areas. It is important to note, however, that building temperatures in underutilized areas will generally be reduced. Therefore, please advise staff to dress appropriately during this time.&#160;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>El receso de invierno del campus durante el periodo 2020-2021 est&#225; programado desde el lunes, 21 de diciembre del 2020 </span><span>hasta el viernes, </span><span>1&#186;</span><span> de en</span><span>ero del 2021. El trabajo regresar&#225; a sesi&#243;n a partir del lunes, 4 de enero del 2021.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Los d&#237;as adicionales son con la intenci&#243;n de proveer a los empleados la flexibilidad de utilizar esos d&#237;as en respuesta a los impactos relacionados al COVID-19 que todos hemos vivido. De varias maneras, todos hemos sido afectados por COVID-19, ya sea por los incendios m&#225;s el estr&#233;s y desgaste del trabajo. Esperamos que todos puedan tomar este tiempo para disfrutar las fechas festivas de manera saludable y sosegada.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Seis (6) d&#237;as de descanso del campus (en vez de los tres d&#237;as tradicionales) m&#225;s los cuatro (4) d&#237;as festivos pagados otorgaran a la mayor&#237;a de los empleados dos (2) semanas completas de descanso. Este es el resumen de c&#243;mo se van a asignar los diez d&#237;as de descanso:&#160;</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#9679;</span><span>&#160; &#160; &#160; </span><span>Los d&#237;as 24, 25 y 31 de diciembre del 2020 y el 1 de enero del 2021 son d&#237;as de descanso pagados en la universidad (si se cumplen los criterios de elegibilidad).&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#9679;</span><span>&#160; &#160; &#160; </span><span>El 21, 22, 23, 28, 29 y 30 de diciembre del 2020 son d&#237;as de receso.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Para estos d&#237;as de receso, los empleados pueden solicitar vacaciones, utilizar tiempo libre compensatorio acumulado (CTO) o tomarlos como d&#237;as con permiso sin sueldo (LWOP). Los empleados que no tengan suficientes horas de vacaciones acumuladas pueden utilizar por adelantado hasta seis (6) d&#237;as de permiso para tomar vacaciones durante el per&#237;odo de receso del campus. Adem&#225;s, aquellos empleados que normalmente deban esperar seis (6) meses antes de utilizar sus vacaciones obtenidas por derecho, podr&#225;n utilizar sus horas de vacaciones acumuladas aun si el per&#237;odo de espera no se ha completado.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>En adici&#243;n a las acumulaciones de descanso previamente descritas, solo por este a&#241;o, los empleados podr&#225;n utilizar su Pago Administrativo Extendido de la UC por COVID-19 para cubrir hasta seis (6) d&#237;as de trabajo durante el periodo de receso.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>En ciertos casos, empleados acad&#233;micos y no acad&#233;micos deber&#225;n trabajar durante parte o todo el periodo de descanso en consideraci&#243;n de las distintas responsabilidades para el cumplimiento de sus obligaciones. Cualquier empleado, independientemente de su ubicaci&#243;n laboral, incluyendo trabajo remoto, solo podr&#225;n trabajar con el permiso expl&#237;cito de su oficial principal/oficial designado y supervisor.&#160;</span><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Las unidades que planean continuar con las operaciones normales durante el receso del campus tienen que recibir la aprobaci&#243;n de la autoridad correspondiente y deber&#225;n consultar el memorando &#8220;Excepciones por el cierre del campus&#8221; que la &#225;rea de Infraestructura F&#237;sica (Physical Plant) enviar&#225; pr&#243;ximamente. Este memorando explicar&#225; el procedimiento necesario para garantizar que la calefacci&#243;n en las &#225;reas de trabajo se mantengan encendidas. Sin embargo, es importante indicar que la temperatura del edificio en &#225;reas que generalmente se utilizan muy poco disminuir&#225;. Por lo tanto, se le recomienda al personal vestir con ropa adecuada durante esos d&#237;as.&#160;</span></p>

<p>CUCRA, an organization that advocates for all UC retirees at the systemwide level, is conducting the survey to better tell the stories of the collective activities and accomplishments of retirees following UC employment.</p>
<p>Participation in the survey will:</p>
<ul>
<li><span></span>Enable CUCRA, its member retirees associations and retiree centers to advocate more effectively on behalf of UC retirees.</li>
<li><span></span>Help the UC Office of the President and campus and laboratory administrators better understand the contributions made by retirees to UC and the broader community.</li>
<li><span></span>Assist UC retirees associations and retiree centers to create and improve useful programs and services for retirees.</li>
<li><span></span>Provide retirees with comprehensive information about their collective contributions and achievements.</li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following discussions to resolve the disagreement over the past several years, and as recently as August, leaders with UC Santa Cruz and the city of Santa Cruz have reached an impasse and agreed that the court needs to resolve the matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I strongly believe that most disagreements can be worked out if people sit down and talk things through," Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. "Sometimes circumstances prevent people from reaching an agreement despite the best of intentions. In such cases, an outside opinion is helpful if not warranted.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz and the city have a </span><a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/better-together/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strong and productive relationship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we both agree that it will continue, particularly through our shared commitment to water conservation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chancellor and the mayor of Santa Cruz <a href="joint-statement-water.xml">issued a joint statement</a>, stating both parties agree that asking for a judge to weigh in is the best path forward to resolve this dispute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Board of Regents and city leaders signed agreements in <a href="images/1962-water-services-agreement.pdf">1962</a> and <a href="images/1965-water-agreement.pdf">1965</a>, which include commitments for water service. The city agreed&#8212;even before the campus was built&#8212;to provide the site&#8212;which has included at all times the property located in the northern regions of campus (North Campus) and the property immediately adjacent to campus located west and south of Empire Grade&#8212;with access to essential services including water.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In expanding access to higher education for California's residents, state leaders envisioned UC Santa Cruz to be a comprehensive research university that would eventually grow and educate thousands of students annually. Its 2,000-acre residential campus would be home to residential colleges, academic buildings, and other facilities. For nearly 40 years the city complied and honored these agreements with little or no dispute.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disagreement is not about campus water usage, which the campus has significantly reduced over the past 15 years. UC Santa Cruz has a proven track record of carefully managing&#8212;and reducing&#8212;its water use. The campus is using less water than it did 25 years ago. In typical academic years, the campus only accounts for 6 percent of the demand in the Santa Cruz water district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus's strategic water master plan, developed in 2007 and fully implemented in 2013, has enabled the campus to save approximately 30 million gallons annually. The campus continues to look for innovative ways to reduce water use and to reuse water, including updating its leak detection system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today's per capita use has declined 40 percent from a three-year average in 2003-2005. UC Santa Cruz continues to develop new ways of reducing its usage and reusing water.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disagreement is about assurances by the city regarding water access. Under UC policy, campuses must have land-use plans&#8212;called Long Range Development Plans (LRDP)&#8212;to help leaders think about the ways in which the university may evolve. These plans designate certain areas of the campus as sites for possible housing communities, academic buildings, and other facilities and develop frameworks for potential transportation needs. The plan helps the campus meet the educational and research needs of its students, faculty and staff. Confirmed water access is critical to thoughtful and reasonable planning.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC is simply asking for the city to confirm whether or not it intends to fulfill its original agreement with the University of California. Since campus and city leaders disagree on the meaning of these original agreements, they are asking the court to help us resolve the issue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s the idea behind an ambitious year-long project designed to address prison and policing issues organized by the UC Santa Cruz Institute of the Arts and Sciences. The upcoming two-part project, titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barring Freedom</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visualizing Abolition</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will feature:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">work from influential contemporary artists like Sanford Biggers and Titus Kaphar;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">music from well-known musicians directed by Grammy-winning drummer and composer Terri Lyne Carrington;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">films;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discussions with prison-abolition luminaries like Angela Davis, political activist and UC Santa Cruz History of Consciousness Professor Emerita, and Bryan Stevenson, a public-interest lawyer and founder of the Equal Justice Initiative who has helped win release or reversal for 135 prisoners on death rows around the country.&#160;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barring Freedom</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exhibit will be on view at the San Jose Museum of Art Oct. 30&#8211;May 2021 and at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York in fall 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visualizing Abolition</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> discussion and film series launches online Oct. 20 and continues until May 18, 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For me, this is exciting because it is a multimedia event with an amazing set of creative people who are going to be able to come together around a central issue of our time,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor of Feminist Studies Gina Dent, who is a longtime prison abolitionist. &#8220;I&#8217;m so much looking forward to the dynamic exchanges and to see what comes out of it; to have the series be a creative production in and of itself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Birth of an exhibition</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the idea of setting up a program around prisons, policing, and justice seems especially timely, the genesis of the project actually began four years ago during a discussion between UC Santa Cruz Professor of Sociology Herman Gray and Interim Director of the Institute of the Arts and Sciences Rachel Nelson. In a conversation about how prevalent issues of prisons and policing had become within contemporary art after the police killings of Eric Garner, Michael Brown Jr., and Tamir Rice, among others, the idea of an exhibition was born.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not only is it a subject that particularly concerns the U.S. right now and when the exhibition was conceived,&#8221; Nelson said by telephone from her home, &#8220;but also because UC Santa Cruz has long been a place where art, research, and activism around prisons has flourished.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty and students, including Davis and Dent, for instance, were part of the founding the Critical Resistance movement, which is now a nonprofit organization advocating for prison abolition and better conditions inside prison walls. They helped organize the first Critical Resistance conference in 1998, which, according to Dent, is often characterized as the beginning of a new generation&#8217;s activism against the U.S. prison system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, in 2000, UC Santa Cruz was the site of the Incite! Violence Against Women of Color conference, which drew 2,000 people and highlighted the voices of women of color activists addressing issues of violence, immigration rights, and prison proliferation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also the home of Psychology Professor Craig Haney, who has spent four decades studying the damaging psychological effects of imprisonment and solitary confinement. Not only has Haney testified before a U.S. Senate judiciary subcommittee about his research, but also his 2018 testimony in a Vancouver courtroom helped lead to a landmark Canadian court ruling that prohibited solitary confinement in that country, according to newspaper reports. Haney has acted as both an advisor and participant in the project.</span></p>
<p><strong>Continuing the anti-slavery movement</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Dent, who also spoke by phone from her home, the art installation and online speaking events are a continuation of her life&#8217;s work. Studying the way in which the United States&#8217; punishment-based carceral system has invaded much of our life&#8212;from TV shows and movies to corporations that profit off prisons and even parenting styles&#8212;she sees the push to abolish prisons as a continuation of the anti-slavery movement.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All of the (prison) abolition work has been inspired by the anti-slavery abolitionist cause,&#8221; Dent said. &#8220;It has always been our view that we could imagine a future without prisons if only we could draw on the way our ancestors imagined a world without slavery.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it&#8217;s no easy task, which is why UC Santa Cruz organizers are bringing in a wide range of people to tackle the topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s own Film and Digital Media Professor Sharon Daniel and Art Professor and Academy Award&#8211;nominated and Emmy award&#8211;winning filmmaker Dee Hibbert-Jones, both of whom have artwork featured in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barring Freedom</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exhibit;&#160;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Distinguished Professor of the Arts Isaac Julien, who will present his 10-screen film and photographic exhibit titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lessons of the Hour</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which explores the life of abolitionist, statesman, and former slave Frederick Douglass. (The exhibit can be viewed at the McEvoy Foundation for the Arts in San Francisco.)&#160;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Titus Kaphar, an artist and MacArthur genius award winner whose works are in the permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and who captured the public&#8217;s imagination with his George Floyd cover for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> magazine;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanford Biggers, a Harlem-based artist whose work includes bullet-ravaged statues and altered heirloom quilts that tell stories of the Black experience and American violence.&#160;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Helping us see and hear differently</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A participatory sculpture of a solitary confinement cell surrounded by a garden visualized by a death-row inmate is also part of the event. Created by artist jackie sumell, the </span><a href="https://magazine.ucsc.edu/2020/02/a-growing-movement/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solitary Garden</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sits on campus and asks visitors to imagine a landscape without prisons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We can&#8217;t imagine a future different than the present without involving our best creators,&#8221; said Nelson. &#8220;Some of our academic friends are those people, but I am also so excited to be working with people&#8212;artists, musicians, and others&#8212;who are in the business of helping us see and hear differently.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Dent and Nelson hope the programming will appeal to a broad range of people, including students. Not only will some classes at UC Santa Cruz be incorporating the programming into their lesson plans, Nelson said, but also the campus also has created a partnership with Howard University School of Law, the oldest historically Black college or university law school in the United States. Students from both universities will have the opportunity to view two of the scheduled conversations, followed by their own joint discussion, according to Nelson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, the project will have lasting effect. Alexandra Moore, co-curator of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barring Freedom</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and IAS graduate curatorial fellow, has worked with a team of graduate students on a website that will be both archive and educational resource. The site, </span><a href="https://barringfreedom.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">barringfreedom.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will launch Oct. 30 to coincide with the opening of the exhibition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Nelson and Dent see the programming as hopeful.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The pandemics of COVID-19, racist violence, and prisons are certainly with us, but abolitionists are always living with hope inside these moments and structures,&#8221; Dent said. &#8220;When I&#8217;m asked about the difficulty of being Black in the U.S., I always point to the joy of living and being a scholar of that experience; and I am always aware that things can change.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>While she says her mind was afire with the theoretical underpinnings of human rights across the globe, she yearned for a concrete and impactful outlet for her accumulated knowledge.</p>
<p>She found the opportunity to apply her theoretical knowledge at the Human Rights Investigations Lab, directed by Sylvanna Falc&#243;n, an associate professor of Latin American and Latino studies and a human rights researcher.</p>
<p>The Human Rights Investigations Lab at UC Santa Cruz has partnered with UC Berkeley&#8217;s Human Rights Center (HRC) to train students in the emerging field of digital verification, which uses &#8220;open-source investigation&#8221; tools and techniques to find and verify facts. Students in the Berkeley and UCSC labs learn to sift through social media postings, news media footage, satellite imagery, Google Maps and other sources available on the internet to investigate human rights abuses in the Americas and around the world. HRC opened its lab in 2016 and UC Santa Cruz established its lab in 2019.</p>
<p>Most recently, these two Human Rights Investigations Labs collaborated on open source research focused on the human rights crisis in Chile, which began with massive anti-government demonstrations a year ago that prompted a swift and sometimes brutal government crackdown on protestors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The massiveness of the protest captured the students&#8217; imagination and their attention,&#8221; Falc&#243;n says. &#8220;There was a feeling of being a witness to history and with these new open source research skills, a deep desire to do something.&#8221;</p>
<p>That something was the meticulous composition of three separate reports about the mass protests that began on October 19, 2019 &#8212; <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/1ee6a10615944aeab3be4fce51c03989">the first of which</a> is a joint UC Santa Cruz and UC Berkeley visual investigation, which provides historical context and compares and contrasts the perspective of protestors and government leaders about the underlying societal factors that led to the mass demonstration. The <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/4f93aae74a2444e399a20b8196a2d264">second report</a> from UCSC&#8217;s Investigations Lab explores the lives and deaths of 25 people who were killed during the protests in an attempt to determine whether there was a system-wide use of violence and intimidation by Chilean authorities. And the <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/a77a9bdcd535488e8ab0df8061a32296">last investigation</a>, also from UCSC&#8217;s lab, explores the final week in the life of activist Germ&#225;n Arbuto.</p>
<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L5MFNYrnjOc" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p>Germ&#225;n Arbuto was a young man who posted prolifically on various social media platforms during the protests, sharing videos and anecdotes about his and his fellow activists&#8217; participation in mass protests in the rural province of Curico in Central Chile.</p>
<p>Arbuto died under allegedly suspicious circumstances in a jail cell on October 26, 2019. His final post to Facebook the day before read: &#8220;I failed but the struggle continues!&#8221;</p>
<p>Even though the authorities ruled his death a suicide, his family, friends and fellow activists cast doubt on the official rendition of the death expressing suspicion that he had been killed by Carabineros (the Chilean national police.)</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an important case to highlight,&#8221; said Arias, who compiled the report by combing through Arbuto&#8217;s copious social media postings in the week that led up to his death. &#8220;There were so many questions including was he documenting all of this on purpose, leaving a virtual trail behind in case of his death?&#8221;</p>
<p>Arias said she is skeptical of the official story ruling his death a suicide, pointing to disparities in how the incident was covered in the mainstream press and how it was talked about on the social media accounts of Arbuto&#8217;s family and friends.</p>
<p>Arias says that she can&#8217;t say definitively either way, and that her role as an open-source investigator is to compile evidence so that those better positioned to interview relatives, friends and the authorities are better equipped with the facts on the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;We exclusively use whatever is publicly available online and this can have its drawbacks,&#8221; Arias says. &#8220;Even though we don&#8217;t interview people as part of open source research, we can still gather valuable information,&#8221; Falc&#243;n says.</p>
<p>&#8220;We systemically collate vast information into a chronological order to create a semblance of what actually happens,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>This information can be valuable to human rights organizations or could even play a role in legal cases as relatives of those assailed attempt to seek justice.</p>
<p>The three published reports on the mass protests in Chile were driven internally by the students, according to Falc&#243;n. So she and her UC Berkeley counterparts worked together to support them.</p>

</figure>
<p>Graduate student Francesca Romeo is one of many students who initiated the lab&#8217;s deep dive into the mass protests in Chile.</p>
<p>She helped author and provide imagery for the report called <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/4f93aae74a2444e399a20b8196a2d264">&#8220;Chile at the Threshold&#8221;</a> which investigated the circumstances surrounding the deaths of 25 different individuals during the turbulent days that followed the first eruption of protests on October 19, 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a deeply emotional experience for us, one that brought up a lot of ethical issues for us,&#8221; Romeo says. &#8220;I think we all struggled with how to best represent these lives that had been lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>The difficulties weren&#8217;t necessarily restricted to the emotional and ethical aspects of honoring the lives of 25 people who died, but also trying to do so in a manner that put together a coherent timeline that could provide insight into the activities of protestors and the authority figures seeking to control or curtail those protests.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open source work is like good research or good journalism in that while you are never going to get pure objectivity, you have to try and expose the facts as they are lived on the ground,&#8221; Romeo says. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s all about finding disparate constellations of information and trying to cohere a whole.&#8221;</p>
<p>Romeo says that involves learning what you cannot say as well as what you can.</p>
<p>For instance, one of the 25 individuals involved in the report was a 33-year-old woman named Valeska Carmona Lopez, who was originally thought to have been targeted as a protestor and shot in the neck by a Chilean soldier.</p>
<p>In fact, the open-source investigation revealed Lopez was the victim of a common crime that occurred in proximity to ongoing protests.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is why you have to be careful about what you believe on the internet,&#8221; Falc&#243;n says.</p>
<p>In a third report, <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/1ee6a10615944aeab3be4fce51c03989">&#8220;Human Rights Crisis in Chile: A Digital Inquiry,&#8221;</a> Falc&#243;n says, &#8220;The UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz teams collected and organized 358 photos, videos, and social media posts to shape the investigation and the report both chronicles the justification of excessive police violence against protestors by Chilean authorities and a timeline of protest activity to explain why people were in the streets.&#8221; &#8220;There were sprouts of protests throughout the decades, but the 2019&#8211;2020 protests just shows how the people of Chile are really tired of economic inequality,&#8221; Arias says.</p>
<p>For Arias, the opportunity to conduct open-source investigations into Chile&#8217;s societal issues past and present provided a vital window into the issues of human rights that extend beyond the borders of the United States. Involvement with the Human Rights Investigations Lab enabled her to apply skills that make a positive difference in those very issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open-source investigation is where I can contribute to positive change,&#8221; says Arias, who has just started a new job in open source research.</p>
<p>For Falc&#243;n, such a development underscores the dual purpose of the Human Rights Investigations Lab &#8212; to produce compelling reports that provide insight into human rights issues across the Americas and the globe, while training the next generation of human rights advocates in the emerging field of digital verification and open-source investigations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open-source investigations are the new terrain for human rights accountability,&#8221; Falc&#243;n says. &#8220;And through our labs, University of California students really understand their capacity to enact change.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="246c8358807270171a41329f22b80289"><name>planned-power-outage-anounced-for-santa-cruz-county</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Planned power outage announced for Santa Cruz County</title><summary>Pacific Gas and Electric Co. announced late Monday that it will likely preemptively cut power Wednesday to a large swath of Central and Northern California, including parts of Santa Cruz County, to prevent power lines from sparking wildfires during dry and extremely windy weather forecast for later this week.</summary><start-date>1602615600000</start-date><display-name>Planned power outage announced for Santa Cruz County </display-name><path>/2020/10/planned-power-outage-anounced-for-santa-cruz-county</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/10/planned-power-outage-anounced-for-santa-cruz-county</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1602633892659</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1602633892659</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>Pacific Gas and Electric Co. announced late Monday that it will </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pgealerts.alerts.pge.com/updates/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1602717685376000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHt16pUMehLnBhw_LYK_SG4WI__tA" href="https://pgealerts.alerts.pge.com/updates/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>likely preemptively cut power</span></a><span> Wednesday to a large swath of Central and Northern California, including parts of Santa Cruz County, to prevent power lines from sparking wildfires during dry and extremely windy weather forecast for later this week.</span></p>

(Hal) Hyde, who, as the first vice chancellor for business and finance at the University of California, Santa Cruz, helped create a world-class campus on a sprawling cattle ranch, died peacefully of natural causes Oct. 12, 2020 at age 97.<br/><br/>Founding Chancellor Dean McHenry first tapped Hyde for some consulting work in the early 1960s, then asked him to join his staff in 1964 and be responsible for all non-academic aspects of the new university. &#8220;And that&#8217;s how I got involved, and the rest is history,&#8221; Hyde chuckled in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzSZWHzddmI">2011 video interview</a>.<br/><br/><strong>Pioneering figure in education</strong></p>
<p>Hyde was a pioneering figure in the history of higher education in Santa Cruz County in the 20th century. He was largely responsible for bringing Cabrillo College to the county and served on its board as a trustee for 23 years. He established the initial infrastructure of UC Santa Cruz and, after retiring in 1975, continued to be a devoted friend and advocate for the campus and the county. <br/><br/>&#8220;It is not an overstatement to say that Santa Cruz County is the cultural and intellectual hub it is today in large part because of Hal, shaped by his commitment to and vision for the place his family has called home for generations,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive.<br/><br/><strong>Deep knowledge of Santa Cruz County</strong></p>
<p>Hyde had a deep knowledge of the county, from South County to the North Coast, and his involvement in civic matters spanned nearly a century. Born in 1923, he was a fifth-generation Santa Cruz County resident with ties to both Watsonville, where he was born, and Santa Cruz, where his father was born. He also helped found two university support groups, served as the first president of the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum and as a trustee of the UCSC Foundation, and helped start the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz County and the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County.<br/><br/>As the first vice chancellor of business and finance, Hyde oversaw construction of UCSC&#8217;s first colleges, residence halls, and administrative buildings, and the siting of campus roads. He also hired key staff.<br/>&#8220;Hal was instrumental in planning the campus in a way that accentuates its physical beauty,&#8221; said Chancellor Emeritus George Blumenthal, who arrived at UCSC in 1972, seven years after the campus opened. &#8220;He oversaw construction of the campus's first classrooms, its first colleges, and its first library, thereby putting his imprint on the campus that was to come.&#8221;<br/><br/>As Hyde once put it: "It was Dean McHenry's show, but we had a lot to do to carry it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jerry Walters, one of his early hires, remembers trying to find housing for the first Cowell students in 1965. &#8220;Hal had me looking into bringing the Delta Queen paddle wheeler down from Sacramento, or checking out Navy ships, which were mothballed in the Bay Area, to see if one could come and be attached to the wharf to house students,&#8221; Walters said.</p>
<p><strong>Problem solver</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;He was a problem solver, ready to help anyone on the campus, open to new concepts, creative, able to delegate to others to pull a project together and always available if someone needed help,&#8221; said Walters who remained friends with Hyde for more than 50 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;He loved to tell the story of how he hired me, a young man who came to his interview right after work, still in his Army uniform, not knowing that Hal was a general in the Army reserves,&#8221; said Walters who stayed for 36 years.</p>
<p>Hyde held the vice chancellor position from 1964 to 1975, when the campus grew from zero students and some decaying ranch buildings to an enrollment of 5,600 students with modern classrooms, laboratories, residence halls, playing fields, performing arts theaters, and administrative buildings, including those for Lick Observatory. "It was a major challenge on a beautiful site," said Hyde.</p>
<p>Daughter Marilyn Hyde remembers her parents hosting prospective faculty and staff at their Corralitos home in the early days of the campus because no other facilities were available. She also recalls visiting the campus on four-wheel-drive Jeeps as there were no roads.<br/><br/><strong>'A father figure'</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;He just became a father figure of Santa Cruz,&#8221; said former U.S. Rep. Sam Farr in comments when Hyde was awarded the UC Santa Cruz Fiat Lux Award in 2011. Farr recalls his own father Fred Farr working with Hyde to locate the new UC campus in Santa Cruz. <br/><br/>&#8220;Hal Hyde is a class act. He knew how to get across the message and say this is what the university will do for you,&#8221; said county Supervisor Bruce McPherson in comments in advance of the Fiat Lux. McPherson, whose family owned the Santa Cruz Sentinel newspaper until the 1980s, remembers Hyde coming into the paper&#8217;s office frequently in the &#8216;60s to line up editorial support for the campus from McPherson&#8217;s father, the paper&#8217;s publisher. <br/><br/>He has provided &#8220;an opportunity for thousands of people&#8212;students and older people&#8212;to get into the higher education system, whether it be the community college or UCSC,&#8221; McPherson said.</p>
<p><strong>Berkeley years</strong></p>
<p>Hyde, an only child, moved from Watsonville to Berkeley with his mother and grandmother after his father was killed in a car accident when Hyde was just a young boy. He later described the move as a change of scenery and a chance to be close to supportive relatives.<br/><br/>He became an Eagle Scout, skied at Badger Pass, and graduated from University High School in Oakland in 1941.<br/><br/>Hyde soon enrolled at UC Berkeley but his studies were interrupted by war. &#8220;I was studying for my first final, Zoology 10, on Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941, the world changed,&#8221; he recalled for an <a href="https://library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/harold-hyde">oral history with the University Library</a>. He enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army Reserves in October 1942. He was discharged as a captain after seeing combat in Europe, for which he was awarded a Bronze Star, and re-enrolled at UC Berkeley, where he graduated in 1947. "I guess I'm an 'Old Blue,'" he once said. "If you stuck me, I'd probably bleed blue and gold." Hyde stayed in the Army Reserves for many years, retiring as a brigadier general.</p>
<p><strong>Marriage and an MBA</strong></p>
<p>Graduate school soon followed at the Harvard Business School as did a romance with Persis (Perky) Horner of San Francisco. He studied marketing and retailing, hoping to help his maternal grandfather&#8217;s family business, the Charles Ford Company department store, back in Watsonville. He received an MBA and also proposed to Perky. They were married in August 1949 and raised four children. Perky Hyde died in 2001.<br/><br/>In 1951, after working briefly for a San Francisco department store, family members and associates persuaded Hyde to return to Watsonville to join the Charles Ford Company. <br/><br/>There he thrived as a store executive and became involved in local Watsonville and Santa Cruz County civic affairs including the effort to open a community college in the county. <br/><br/><strong>Cabrillo College</strong></p>
<p>Cabrillo College opened in 1961 and &#8220;the county really coalesced together, and accepted it as their school, their campus, their higher education facility, in a way that had not been seen before, and still exists today, with great support,&#8221; Hyde said in his oral history. &#8220;The Cabrillo success was the first significant expression of total county commitment and support. I still have great pride in having been part of that team of trustees, officers, faculty, staff, and advisory committees of this enterprise.&#8221;<br/><br/>Sights soon turned to a UC campus on the Central Coast, and Hyde became a member of an organizing committee. In an oft-told story, in the summer of 1960 the UC Regents campus siting committee looked at two possible locations, Cowell Ranch in Santa Cruz and another in Santa Clara County&#8217;s Almaden Valley.<br/><br/><strong>A magnificent site</strong></p>
<p>They first visited Santa Cruz and took in the expansive view from the Great Meadow, a cool breeze coming off the Pacific Ocean. Then they got back into an-air conditioned bus for a trip over the hill to the Almaden site. After transferring to two smaller buses without A/C, they stepped out into a very hot July afternoon to look at the valley site.<br/><br/>&#8220;And,&#8221; as Hyde would say, &#8220;the rest is history.&#8221;<br/><br/>Hyde leaves wife Dottie of Corralitos; daughters Christine, of Hollister, and Marilyn, of Watsonville; and sons Douglas, of Massachusetts, and Tony, of Novato.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5rq98388#main</url><title>Harold A.

Hal, who helped transform our campus from a working ranch to a globally known teaching and research institution, died peacefully of natural causes on Monday, Oct. 12, at his home in Corralitos. He was 97.<br/><br/>It is not an overstatement to say that Santa Cruz County is the cultural and intellectual hub it is today in large part because of Hal, shaped by his commitment to and vision for the place his family has called home for generations. He was a key player in the creation of not only UC Santa Cruz, but of Cabrillo College, too, as well as the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz County and the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County. Certainly many others played a role in our county&#8217;s evolution from an agricultural region to a center of innovation and education, but Hal was the person people called when they wanted vision transformed into reality. He got things done, and we are a better campus and community because of it.<br/><br/>In the late 1950s Hal chaired a county committee set on passing a local bond issue for higher education. He was elected to Cabrillo College's first board of trustees, and he served on the local committee that successfully persuaded the University of California to select a Central Coast location for a new campus. Hal, who graduated from UC Berkeley and served in the U.S. Army during World War II before studying business at Harvard, would later join UCSC as vice chancellor of business and finance. Chief among his duties was building UCSC's infrastructure, literally from the ground up. He oversaw construction of the first colleges, residence halls, and administrative buildings. He helped decide the locations of campus roads and recreational fields.<br/><br/>As a relative newcomer to campus, I only met Hal last fall. We talked about how different student move-in was nowadays compared to the year campus opened. No idea was dismissed in those early days, including possibly housing all students on a ship. Campus leaders eventually settled on a series of trailers organized in star patterns that would promote community. He was rightfully proud of how nimble and creative campus leaders had to be at that time.<br/><br/>Hal&#8217;s commitment to our campus continued after he decided to leave higher education in 1975. He was a founding member of two UCSC support groups, serving as the first president of the Arboretum Associates and as a trustee of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation. His interest in UC Santa Cruz never waned. Longtime staffers and faculty members who knew Hal say he would frequently reach out, offering congratulations on an award or work achievement or just to talk about a research project that interested him.<br/><br/>That our colleges and the overall look and feel of our campus have in many ways come to define us are a testament to Hal&#8217;s vision and determination. I hope you will join me in taking a moment to recognize Hal&#8217;s incredible contributions to our campus and community. I extend my condolences to his immediate family &#8212; wife Dottie, daughters Christine and Marilyn, and sons Tony and Douglas &#8212; and to the many people on and off campus who had the good fortune to call Hal a colleague or friend.<br/><br/>A celebration of life will be held at a later date to be announced. Contributions in memory of Hal can be made to the UC Santa Cruz Foundation (TIN: 23-739-4590) care of Gift Administration, 1156 High St., Santa Cruz, CA 95060.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2dee7a1c807270171a41329f2c6e2253"><name>globular-cluster</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Anemic star cluster breaks metal-poor record</title><summary>In a surprising discovery, astronomers have found a globular star cluster in the Andromeda galaxy that contains a record-breaking low amount of metals.</summary><keywords>Jean Brodie, Asher Wasserman</keywords><start-date>1602745200000</start-date><display-name>Anemic star cluster breaks metal-poor record</display-name><path>/2020/10/globular-cluster</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/10/globular-cluster</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1602793404934</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1602793698811</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Mari-Ela Chock, Keck Observatory</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/10/images/globular-cluster-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/10/images/globular-cluster-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>globular-cluster-450.jpg</name><display-name>globular-cluster-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>50870</file-size><width>450</width><height>253</height></image><image-alt>globular star cluster</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/10/images/globular-cluster-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/10/images/globular-cluster-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>globular-cluster-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>globular-cluster-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>10917</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>globular star cluster</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The discovery of the metal-poor globular cluster RBC EXT8 challenges the idea that massive globular star clusters could not have formed at such low metallicities. (Image credit: ESASky/CFHT)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In a surprising discovery, astronomers have found a globular star cluster in the Andromeda galaxy that contains a record-breaking low amount of metals.</p>
<p>The stars in the cluster, called RBC EXT8, have on average 800 times less iron than our sun and are three times more iron-poor than the previous globular cluster record-holder. RBC EXT8 is also extremely deficient in magnesium.</p>
<p>The study, published October 15 in <em>Science</em>, was led by S&#248;ren Larsen of Radboud University in the Netherlands, working closely with three UC Santa Cruz astronomers: Jean Brodie, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC and director of the Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing at Swinburne University, Australia; Aaron Romanowsky, a research associate at UC Observatories and professor of astronomy at San Jose State University; and UCSC graduate student Asher Wasserman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I'm amazed that this remarkable star cluster was just sitting under our noses,&#8221; Romanowsky said. &#8220;It is one of the brightest clusters in the Andromeda galaxy and known for decades, yet no one had checked it out in detail. It shows how the universe still has many surprises for us to discover. It also reminds us to check our assumptions&#8212;in this case, it was assumed enough clusters had been investigated to know how anemic they can be.&#8221;</p>
<p>A globular cluster is a large, dense collection of thousands to millions of ancient stars that move together as a tight-knit group through a galaxy. Until now, astronomers thought large globular clusters had to contain a considerable amount of heavy elements.</p>
<p>&#8220;This discovery is exciting because the idea of a &#8216;metallicity floor&#8217; for globular clusters, that must contain some minimum amount of heavy metals, underpinned so much of our thinking about how these very old star clusters formed in the early universe,&#8221; Brodie said. &#8220;Our finding contradicts the standard picture, and that is always fun!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hydrogen and helium are the two main elements created after the Big Bang. Heavier elements such as iron and magnesium formed later. Finding a massive globular cluster like RBC EXT8 that is extremely impoverished in metals defies current formation models, calling into question some of our ideas about the birth of stars and galaxies in the young universe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our finding shows that massive globular clusters could form in the early universe out of gas with only a small &#8216;sprinkling&#8217; of elements other than hydrogen and helium. This is surprising because such pristine gas was thought to be in building blocks too small to form such massive star clusters,&#8221; said Larsen.</p>
<p>The researchers observed RBC EXT8 using Keck Observatory&#8217;s High-Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) in October of 2019. The globular cluster was not originally on the program, but the team had a couple of hours of observing time left and decided to aim the Keck I telescope at the cluster, whose stellar content had not yet been studied in detail. The team made spectroscopic observations to determine RBC EXT8&#8217;s metal content and used three archive images from CFHT to determine its size and estimate its mass. Their remarkable result came as quite a surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is observationally challenging to obtain a detailed analysis of the chemical composition of globular clusters in the Andromeda galaxy, which is in the Northern Hemisphere of the sky,&#8221; said Brodie. &#8220;The HIRES capability at Keck is uniquely well-suited to meet this challenge.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the future, the researchers hope to find more &#8220;metal-lite&#8221; globular clusters and solve the mystery about their origin.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2e0445c4807270171a41329ff818beec"><name>czufireaftermathstory</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> 'Response, recovery, and resiliency'</title><summary>Threatened with wildfires in August and September, an army of UC Santa Cruz employees worked hard to keep their community safe, fed, and housed. &#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Threatened with wildfires in August and September, an army of UC Santa Cruz employees worked hard to keep their community safe, fed, and housed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their fast and focused response speaks to the dedication of these workers, and their strong sense of personal and professional responsibility, said Sarah Latham, vice chancellor of business administrative services, who helped oversee the campus&#8217;s fire response.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was really heartening&#8212;the stories of people helping each other in this horrible situation,&#8221; Latham said. &#8220;It showed the best of who we are as a campus, as a community, as people coming together to support each other, especially considering the fact that the people who were helping were also being impacted.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those employees helped to secure the UC Santa Cruz campus and relocate the 1,215 people who were living on the campus, or nearby, when the fire broke out.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CZU August Lightning Complex Fires started on the early morning of August 16, when a thunderstorm rained more than 11,000 lightning bolts, setting off hundreds of wildfires. By the time the fire was 100 percent contained on Tuesday, September 22, the blazes had consumed more than 86,509 acres and destroyed 925 homes, killing one person and injuring another.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a time of uncertainty and stress for many community members&#8212;including the UC Santa Cruz employees who were working hard to help others while facing dislocation themselves. An estimated 600 UC Santa Cruz staffers had to evacuate from their homes in Davenport, Felton, Bonny Doon, and on campus, Latham said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I would be on Zoom calls, and someone would have to drop off the call because they had to evacuate, or they could see the fires in the distance,&#8221; Latham said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Director of Dining Bill Prime, whose team arranged to move food services down to the evacuation center set up at the Cocoanut Grove Ballroom at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, was on one of those frightening Zoom calls.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Prime&#8217;s screen, other Zoom participants could see the fire in the distance.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He showed us a view of the mountain in the distance and said, &#8216;Now we have to go,&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; Latham said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The impact on the UC Santa Cruz community was far-ranging. About 40 university employees lost their homes in the fires.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Their homes were either destroyed, or damaged to the extent that they were not inhabitable,&#8221; Latham said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some evacuees relocated with loved ones, while others were taken to the University Town Center in Santa Cruz or to various Santa Cruz hotels, including the Carousel Beach Inn and the Sea and Sand Inn. One campus employee, shortly before leaving the UTC, left a heartfelt note of appreciation: "You took us in when we were dazed and helpless. You fed us and were kind beyond question."&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The note-writer also thanked the staff for being kind to the family's pets, described as their "fur family. Thank you isn't enough but it's all we have right now. Please know we won't forget!"&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few evacuees stayed overnight at the Cocoanut Grove at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, which was used as a relocation center for UC Santa Cruz. About 40 students were moved to residence halls at San Jose State University, which threw open its doors for students in need.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Adjusting quickly to a dangerous situation</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not long after the fire broke out, the Santa Cruz County government was considering UC Santa Cruz as an evacuation center for impacted communities. But that plan was scrapped when it became clear that the heavily wooded, 2,000-acre campus was in the fire&#8217;s path.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it turned out, the fire never breached the campus. As a precautionary measure to protect UC Santa Cruz and the city of Santa Cruz, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection dug fire breaks on the edge of campus to stop the spread of wildfire.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus&#8217;s coordinated response was swift and efficient, Latham said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Things went very well and we were able to evacuate the campus relatively quickly because we started communications early, and people heeded the message,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time Cal Fire issued its formal evacuation order for the campus on the Sunday after the fire broke out, &#8220;most everyone was already gone from the campus,&#8221; Latham said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fire added another layer of complexity to the campus's response to the COVID-19 crisis.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We needed to set up safety precautions with PPE and physical distancing when we set up the evacuation center and when we were transporting people on buses over the hill,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she also spoke of the "reverse impact." The fire response and evacuation delayed a planned COVID-19 testing ramp-up at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So there was an intersection, where one crisis impacted another crisis,&#8221; Latham said</span></p>
<p><strong>A helping hand&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the fire was unpredictable, the UC Santa Cruz community&#8217;s outpouring of support was strong and consistent. UC Santa's University Relations office established the UC Santa Cruz </span><a href="https://2020wildfirerelief.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wildfire Relief fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and started raising money while the fire was still raging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That fundraising effort was later folded into </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/10/giving-day-2020-feature.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a 24-hour online giving festival. More than 1,000 donors stepped forward to raise nearly $153,000 for the fire relief fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of this writing, 72 campus employees have received more than $73,000 to help them pay for food, shelter, clothing, rent payments, out-of-pocket medical expenses, and assistance with repairs for damaged homes.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These grants are intended to help employees with expenses that will not otherwise be reimbursed or covered by insurance. Additionally, funds raised for the Slug Support Fund are going directly to students who have been impacted by the wildfire.</span></p>

They also gave the recipients a feeling of community.&#160;&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="docos-replyview-body docos-streamreplyview-body docos-replyview-static">"It's honestly been a month since I've cried, and I feel tears forming reading your email," said one recipient, after receiving wildlfire relief funds. "</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="docos-replyview-body docos-streamreplyview-body docos-replyview-static">UC Santa Cruz has been my home for the last 7 years as of today, and I've stayed because of all of the moments I've felt connected to this community. It goes without saying that being held and supported in this way is exemplary of that feeling."<br/><br/>"I can&#8217;t begin to express how deeply grateful we are for these funds which come at a very much needed time for us!" wrote another anonymous recipient. "So please, extend to the rest of the family our deepest and most sincerest thanks not only for this monetary support but also the emotional support given throughout our community."</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those funds will help the UC Santa Cruz community in the aftermath of the fire. But &#8220;getting back to normal&#8217;&#8217; is a long and complicated process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the act of resettling displaced campus residents was nuanced and painstaking. When the fires broke out, workers had to &#8220;harden&#8221; the campus, turning off electricity and gas to minimize the potential for explosions if the fire engulfed the campus. It took two weeks to undo all those necessary protections.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People were working around the clock including weekends to bring systems back online, to transfer utilities back over,&#8221; Latham said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For every campus building that reopened, the fire marshal, Physical Plant staff, and Environmental Health and Safety all had to give the go-ahead, with Latham and Associate Vice Chancellor of Risk and Safety Services Jean Marie Scott doing the final sign-offs. Administration also had to wait for the smoky air to clear.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a step-by-step process,&#8221; Latham said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t just bring people back.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like every step of the fire response, the resettling of the campus required a combination of planning and flexibility, Latham said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve never had a full-campus evacuation before. We responded in phases&#8212;response, recovery, and resiliency,"&#160;she said. "Resilience means learning through experience. Hopefully, this will never happen again. But if it does, we will be well prepared.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2e3e3ef1807270171a41329f27f382b1"><name>october-22-town-hall</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Oct. 22 Town Hall to focus on budget present, future</title><summary>After much conversation, we understand that there are many issues occurring all at once, but foremost on many of our minds is what is happening with our campus budget.

<p>The report, &#8220;On-demand and on-the-edge: Ride-hailing and Delivery Workers in San Francisco,&#8221; underscores the financial vulnerability of workers in the gig economy.</p>
<p>Lead researcher Chris Benner, a professor of environmental studies and sociology and the director of the Institute for Social Transformation, said it&#8217;s great to see the research being used to inform the debate over Prop. 22.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our research makes clear that so-called &#8216;gig workers&#8217; are living on the edge, and value fair pay and employment protections as much as they value flexibility in when they work. I&#8217;m pleased that these findings are being shared with the 21 million California registered voters who will receive the official voter guide&#8221;</p>
<p>The proposition&#8212;if passed&#8212;would exempt app-based drivers from California employment law designed to narrow who is classified as &#8220;independent contractors,&#8221; instead of &#8220;employees,&#8221; and provide independent-contractor drivers other compensation, unless certain criteria are met, according to the <a href="https://vig.cdn.sos.ca.gov/2020/general/pdf/complete-vig.pdf">voter guide</a>.</p>
<p>If the proposition passes, app-based rideshare and delivery companies could hire drivers legally as independent contractors, but workers would not get standard benefits and protections that businesses must provide employees.</p>
<p>If the proposition fails, app-based rideshare and delivery companies would have to hire drivers as employees and would get standard benefits and protections that businesses must provide employees.</p>
<p>Authors of this measure contend it is needed to protect jobs and allow app-based drivers to remain independent contractors.</p>
<p>Benner says that the rideshare and delivery companies backing Proposition 22 like to portray it as a choice between flexibility and employment protections, but that this is misleading.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our research shows that the majority of the services provided by these companies is done by people who work full time and for whom this is their only source of income,&#8221; Benner said. &#8220;There is no reason these companies can&#8217;t provide work flexibility for some people who need it while also meeting for all their workers the normal employment standards we expect of all employers in California.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2eaa83e3807270171a41329f5861d89e"><name>visualizing-abolition-series</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>âVisualizing Abolitionâ series kicks off with conversation featuring Angela Davis and Gina Dent</title><summary>The UCSC Institute of the Arts and Sciences has joined forces with associate feminist studies professor Gina Dent to offer a year-long online series featuring artists, activists, scholars, and lawyers united by their commitment to the struggle for prison abolition.</summary><keywords>UC Santa Cruz news, ucsc news, prison reform, mass incarceration, black lives matter, racial discrimination, poverty, institutional racism, systemic racism, criminal justice system, racial reconciliation, ucsc arts and sciences, ucsc arts division, Isaac julien</keywords><start-date>1602811500000</start-date><display-name>Visualizing Abolition series </display-name><path>/2020/10/visualizing-abolition-series</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/10/visualizing-abolition-series</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1602805728203</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1602812148034</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Digital Arts and New Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Feminist Studies</value><value>History of Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Admissions</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/10/images/davisdent-475.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/10/images/davisdent-475.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>davisdent-475.jpg</name><display-name>davisdent-475.jpg</display-name><file-size>134879</file-size><width>475</width><height>380</height></image><image-alt>Angela Y.

<p><span>Running from October 20, 2020 to May 19, 2021, <i>Visualizing Abolition</i>&#160;is designed to examine the ways people see and understand issues of mass incarceration, detention, and policing in the United States and abroad, challenging the prevailing social, economic, and political worldviews that prisons promote.</span></p>
<p><span>The series kicks off on October 20 when UC Santa Cruz distinguished professor emerita Angela Davis will be featured in a conversation with Dent to discuss critical issues in the arts, visual culture, and abolition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Recently inducted into <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/07/davis-hall-fame.html"><strong><i>The National Women&#8217;s Hall of Fame</i></strong></a><i>, </i>Davis spent 15 years as a faculty member at UC Santa Cruz until her retirement in 2008. She is the author of 10 books and has lectured throughout the United States, as well as in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and South America, focusing on the range of social problems associated with incarceration and the generalized criminalization of those communities that are most affected by poverty and racial discrimination.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Her books include&#160;<i>Abolition Democracy,</i> <i>Are Prisons Obsolete?</i>, a new edition of&#160;<i>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass</i>;&#160;and a&#160;collection of essays entitled&#160;<i>The Meaning of Freedom</i>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The series continues </strong>on October 27 with Bryan Stevenson, an acclaimed U.S. civil rights lawyer who has dedicated his life to the pursuit of racial equality and challenging the historical legacy of institutional racism in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span>Stevenson recently received a 2020 Right Livelihood Award&#8212;widely known as the &#8220;Alternative Nobel Prize&#8221;&#8212;for his efforts to reform the criminal justice system and advance racial reconciliation in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span>The founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), a human rights organization in Montgomery, Alabama, Stevenson has won major legal challenges eliminating excessive and unfair sentencing, exonerating innocent death row prisoners, confronting abuse of the incarcerated and the mentally ill, and aiding children prosecuted as adults.</span></p>
<p><span>He has argued and won multiple cases at the U.S. Supreme Court, including a 2019 ruling protecting condemned prisoners who suffer from dementia and a landmark 2012 ruling that banned mandatory life-without-parole sentences for all children 17 or younger. He has also won reversals, relief or release from prison for 140 wrongly condemned prisoners on death row and for hundreds of others wrongly convicted or unfairly sentenced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Stevenson is the author of the award winning <i>New York Times </i>bestseller, <i>Just Mercy</i>, which was recently adapted as a major motion picture.&#160;He has also led the creation of two highly acclaimed cultural sites which opened in 2018, The Legacy Museum and The National Memorial for Peace and Justice. These new national landmark institutions document the legacy of slavery, lynching, and racial segregation, and the connection to mass incarceration and contemporary issues of racial bias.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Other events in the series</strong> will include a poetry reading and conversation with award-winning American poet, memoirist, and educator Reginald Dwayne Betts<strong>,</strong> who uses poetry and literature to speak to the failures of the current criminal justice system and to create ideas for change; a talk and limited online film screening with UCSC distinguished professor of the arts Isaac Julien about his 10-screen film installation on Frederic Douglass,<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/10/julien-mcevoy-exhibition.html"><strong> Lessons of the Hour</strong></a>; and a conversation with Harlem-based artist Sanford Biggers, who will be joined by visual culture theorist Leigh Raiford for a conversation about art, violence, and possibility.</span></p>
<p><span>All of the events in the <i>Visualizing Abolition</i> series will take place from 4-5:30 p.m. (PST) unless otherwise noted, and registration is required. They&#160;are being presented in conjunction with <a href="https://ias.ucsc.edu/events/2020/barring-freedom-san-jose-museum-art-october-23-2020-march-21-2021"><strong><i>Barring Freedom</i></strong></a>, a bi-coastal exhibition of art on view at San Jos&#233; Museum of Art from October 30, 2020, through March 21, 2021, and featuring&#160;<strong><i>Solitary Garden</i></strong>,&#160;a public art project, at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>

Most university opera programs reserve significant roles for graduate students. <br/><br/>Shelter-in-place orders in March interrupted the work that would have led to performances. But that wasn&#8217;t that end of the opera&#8217;s big show for 2020. <em>L&#8217;Elisir d&#8217;Amore</em> goes on this fall as a recorded video production. <br/><br/><strong>More than Zoom</strong><br/><br/>Performers will be set up in their own homes with professional audio equipment and green screens to record their performances. Video production will be directed by David Murakami (Porter &#8216;14, digital media), who teaches production design at UC Irvine and has done design and film direction for several Bay Area theater groups. <br/><br/>The new approach to performance will give students valuable experience working with digital tools they may need in their careers, Willey noted. <br/><br/>&#8220;My top goal is that it gives our students a way to keep connecting together and creating together and learning about opera,&#8221; she said. <br/><br/>The opera&#8217;s shift to digital this fall is possible thanks to <a href="https://arts.ucsc.edu/features/featured-alum/uc-santa-cruz-alumnus-scott-lord%E2%80%99s-trivia-talent-makes-him-winner">the support of alumnus Scott Lord</a> (Porter &#8217;76, history), a donor to the program for most of the last decade. Lord, an attorney who litigates cases in the construction industry, is a devoted fan of the form.<br/><br/>&#8220;Opera is a magical confluence of singing, music, acting, and design,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Also, the good operas address personal and philosophical issues. They are often moving and thought provoking.&#8221; <br/><br/>In particular, Lord followed Opera Parall&#232;le, the acclaimed performance group led by Brian Staufenbiel and Nicole Paiement&#8212;who led the UCSC opera program prior to Willey. Through them he learned about the UC Santa Cruz program. <br/><br/>&#8220;I started seeing performances and was really impressed with what they were able to do with what I considered a pretty limited budget,&#8221; Lord said.<br/><br/><strong>An investment in future performers</strong><br/><br/>At the time, Lord had been looking for ways he could contribute to UC Santa Cruz. The opera program was a fit, and Lord has been a major supporter for seven years.<br/><br/>&#8220;As a philanthropist looking at cost benefit: With a relatively modest contribution they were training a lot of people, including some who went on to be serious singers as well as directors and designers,&#8221; he said.<br/><br/>In a typical year for students, the year-long opera program begins with casting in fall, practice&#8212;and perhaps a child-friendly chamber opera&#8212;in winter, and rehearsals leading up to final performances in spring quarter with professionally designed costumes and sets. Usually, sets, lighting, costumes, and design fees are all funded by the opera&#8217;s donors. As the implications of COVID-19 became clear, Lord&#8217;s generosity enabled the opera to envision performing in the pandemic era. <br/><br/>&#8220;This planning was only possible because of support from donors like Scott,&#8221; Willey said.<br/><br/>Additional funding from the federal CARES Act helped cover some of the new expenses. Lord&#8217;s ongoing support means Willey is able to also schedule a spring production of Handel's <em>Semele</em> and, in the 2021&#8211;2022 academic year, a premier by Michael McGushin of his new opera, <em>The Nightingale</em>.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://arts.ucsc.edu/features/featured-alum/uc-santa-cruz-alumnus-scott-lord%E2%80%99s-trivia-talent-makes-him-winner</url><title>Scott Lord wins more than $109,000 on Jeopardy!</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="332c7b7b807270171a41329fa2662257"><name>curtailment-revision</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Curtailment â Revision/correction to Oct. 12 announcement</title><summary>This memo corrects one important error in the Oct. 12 message pertaining to what types of leave can be used to cover the six curtailment days.</summary><start-date>1602831600000</start-date><display-name>Curtailment â Revision/correction to Oct. 12 announcement</display-name><path>/2020/10/curtailment-revision</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/10/curtailment-revision</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1602881354597</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1603133841029</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>On Monday, Oct. 12, we sent a campus message outlining the details of our winter curtailment dates and the types of leave available for use during that period. This memo corrects one important error in the Oct. 12 message pertaining to what types of leave can be used to cover the six curtailment days.</span></p>
<p>COVID-19 UC Expanded Paid Admin Leave is not allowable to use for winter curtailment. This is due to the eligibility requirements of that particular leave program. The COVID leave is for situations when employees cannot work, for COVID-related reasons, when the university is open for business.<br/><span></span></p>
<p>We apologize for the inconvenience and for any confusion this may have caused. &#160;<br/><span></span></p>
<p>Our campus curtailment period will remain the same. All the dates described below will remain in place as stated:<br/><span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span></span><span>Dec. 24, 25, 31 and Jan. 1 are paid university holidays (if eligibility criteria are met)&#160;</span></li>
<li><span></span><span>Dec. 21, 22, 23, 28, 29 and 30 are the six (6) curtailment days&#160;<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Employees may use vacation, accrued compensatory time off (CTO), or leave without pay (LWOP) for the curtailment days, scheduled for Dec. 21, 22, 23, 28, 29 and 30, 2020.&#160;</span></p>
<p>For employees who may not have sufficient accumulated vacation hours, up to six (6) days of vacation leave may be used in advance of actual accrual during the winter curtailment period. Those employees who are normally required to wait six (6) months before using accrued vacation will be allowed to use their vacation hours even if the required waiting period has not been completed.&#160;<br/><span></span></p>

<p><span>Re: Receso de invierno: revisi&#243;n / correcci&#243;n del anuncio del 12 de octubre del 2020</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span>Estimados colegas,</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span>El lunes 12 de octubre, enviamos un mensaje al campus con los detalles de nuestras fechas del periodo de receso de invierno 2020-2021 y los tipos de permisos disponibles para su uso durante ese per&#237;odo. Este memor&#225;ndum corrige un importante error en el mensaje del 12 de octubre relativo a los tipos de permisos que pueden ser utilizados para cubrir los seis d&#237;as de receso de invierno.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span>El pago administrativo extendido de la UC por COVID-19 no se puede usar durante el periodo de receso de invierno. Esto se debe a los requisitos de elegibilidad de este programa. El permiso COVID es para situaciones en las que los empleados no pueden trabajar, por razones relacionadas con el COVID, cuando la universidad est&#225; abierta para los negocios.</span></p>
<p><span>Nos disculpamos por las molestias y por cualquier confusi&#243;n que esto pueda haber causado. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span>El periodo de receso de invierno de nuestro campus seguir&#225; siendo el mismo. Todas las fechas descritas a continuaci&#243;n se mantendr&#225;n en su lugar como se ha indicado:</span></p>
<p><span>Los d&#237;as del 24, 25, y 31 del 2020 y el 1 de enero del 2021 son d&#237;as de descanso pagado de la universidad de fiesta (si se cumplen con los criterios de elegibilidad). &#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Los d&#237;as 21, 22, 23, 28, 29 y 30 de diciembre son los seis (6) d&#237;as del periodo de receso de invierno.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Los empleados pueden solicitar las vacaciones, utilizar el tiempo libre compensatorio acumulado o tomarlos como permiso sin pago de sueldo que est&#225;n programados para los d&#237;as 21, 22, 23, 28, 29 y 30 de diciembre del 2020.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>En el caso de los empleados que no tengan suficientes horas de vacaciones acumuladas, se podr&#225;n utilizar hasta seis (6) d&#237;as de vacaciones antes de la acumulaci&#243;n real durante el per&#237;odo de receso de invierno. Los empleados que normalmente deban esperar seis (6) meses antes de utilizar las vacaciones acumuladas podr&#225;n utilizar sus horas de vacaciones aunque no se haya completado el per&#237;odo de espera requerido.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Gracias.</span></p>

This latest grant builds on the cross-campus partnership between faculty, staff, and administrators who comprise the <a href="https://hsi.ucsc.edu/about/hsi-team-3.html#leadership">HSI Leadership Committee</a>.</p>
<p>The grant&#8212;Graduating and Advancing New American Scholars: Promoting Postbaccalaureate Opportunities for Hispanic Americans (GANAS PPOHA)&#8212;from the U.S. Department of Education will help the campus increase the readiness of Latinx, low-income and students of color from UC Santa Cruz and CSU Monterey Bay to apply and succeed in graduate programs.</p>
<p><a href="https://hsi.ucsc.edu/index.html">Director of HSI Initiatives</a> Charis Herzon said the campus is increasingly focused on how it can strengthen the &#8216;S&#8217;in HSI&#8212;serving&#8212;while also diversifying its graduate student population, its faculty, and its staff.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Department of Education Title V grants are institution-building grants with the goal of transforming higher education to better serve all students,&#8221; Herzon said. &#8220;This grant seeks to serve our students at the graduate level in two ways, creating programs for our undergraduates to increase the number of Latinx and low-income students seeking and enrolling in graduate school and supporting the success of our Latinx and low-income students that are in our graduate programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is one of only 22 Hispanic Serving Institutions in the nation that are also doctorate-granting universities with high levels of research activity (an R1 Carnegie classification) and one of the four HSIs that are members of the Association of American Universities. The campus is the only UC to have received a grant from the Department of Education&#8217;s Promoting Postbaccalaureate Opportunities for Hispanic Americans (PPOHA) program, which began in 2009.</p>
<p>As an HSI, UC Santa Cruz is striving to build racial equity in higher education opportunities and attainment, while also disrupting already existing institutional barriers to equity.</p>
<p>In September, UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/09/hsi-grant.html">received a separate $3 million grant</a>, GANAS Career Pathways, to improve academic and career outcomes for undergraduate students and further advance the campus&#8217;s capacity to achieve excellence and equity of results across groups.</p>
<p>Both GANAS grants&#8212; totalling $6 million spread over five years&#8212;are part of the overall HSI campus initiative meant to advance the success of students who are Latinx, underrepresented and from low-income families.</p>
<p>The GANAS PPOHA project for graduate studies focuses on helping to expand the pipeline of undergraduate students who decide to pursue an advanced degree and ensuring they have the tools to succeed.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz will offer a number of programs to help undergraduates prepare for graduate school, including a research opportunity program for UCSC and CSUMB students, a course on applying to graduate school, and a course about careers in the creative economy for students in the arts.</p>
<p>To support students in earning an advanced degree, UC Santa Cruz will also offer workshops in financial planning, establish a graduate student writing center, and develop a first-year experience course that focuses on collective learning.</p>
<p>The campus is aiming to increase the number of Latinx graduate students enrolled at UC Santa Cruz (currently at 219) by 35 percent by fall 2025. In <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/fall-enrollment-glance">fall 2019</a>, 12 percent of UCSC master&#8217;s students identified as Latinx and 11 percent of Ph.D. students identified as Latinx.The campus is also working to increase those students&#8217; sense of belonging at UCSC.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the campus is working to increase graduate degree completion for Latinx, low-income, and graduate students of color by 3 percentage points by fall 2025.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very exciting moment for the HSI Initiative on campus,&#8221; said Juan Poblete, professor of literature and co-principal investigator. &#8220;We are closing our first three HSI grants and with our two new GANAS grants moving, for the first time, beyond a focus on the early years of undergraduate education towards the latter years, and now graduate school and professional life.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are covering more of the educational pipeline and that is both exciting and challenging, because it places UCSC at the vanguard of HSRIs &#8212; HSIs that are high level research institutions&#8212; in the nation. We want to show that excellence and equity not only can, but should go together.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has been awarded five grants totaling $15.9 million since earning the HSI designation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4229067e807270171a41329ff3e77afa"><name>voter-registration-deadline</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Voter registration deadline is today</title><summary>Today is the deadline to register for the first time or to update your registration if you have moved since last casting a ballot. </summary><start-date>1603090800000</start-date><display-name>Voter registration deadline is today</display-name><path>/2020/10/voter-registration-deadline</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/10/voter-registration-deadline</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1603132786269</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1603132786269</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>Citizens exercising their right to vote is the foundation of our democracy.

<p>The Switzer Fellowship will support Artiga-Purcell's study of social resistance to extractive industry. In particular, his work focuses on water justice and gold mining in El Salvador, where he's documenting lessons learned from the successful social movements that established El Salvador as the only country in the world to ban metal mining.</p>
<p>"Gold mining, and extractive industries in general, are a huge environmental issue, in terms of how they impact water," said Artiga-Purcell. "But there are other social movements that are demanding water justice right now. I'm looking at how we can translate the success and victories of the anti-mining movement more broadly into social and environmental justice within El Salvador, Central America, and beyond."</p>
<p>Artiga-Purcell said the Switzer Fellowship award will be critical to wrapping up and disseminating his dissertation. He hopes to build partnerships between activists and academia in that process. And for him, the fellowship award is also about forming important personal connections with his fellow cohort members.</p>
<p>"It's so nice to meet like-minded scholars and activists from around the country who are all geared toward this issue of promoting social and environmental justice," he said. "And we're all approaching it in very different ways."</p>
<p>During his time at UC Santa Cruz, Artiga-Purcell also received the 2018 Blum Scholar Award and has served since 2019 as part of the Critical Cultural Political Economy of Extractivism Research Cluster within the Research Center for the Americas.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="42945951807270171a41329f07f43661"><name>difference-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>âBe the Differenceâ Award honors UCSC Molecular Diagnostic Lab</title><summary>The award recognizes UCSCâs efforts to provide local testing for coronavirus infections.</summary><start-date>1603090800000</start-date><display-name>âBe the Differenceâ Award honors UCSC Molecular Diagnostic Lab</display-name><path>/2020/10/difference-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/10/difference-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1603139819829</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1603140330687</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value><value>covid-19</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/10/images/scott-la-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/10/images/scott-la-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>scott-la-350.jpg</name><display-name>scott-la-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>77918</file-size><width>350</width><height>354</height></image><image-alt>Scott La</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/10/images/scott-la-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/10/images/scott-la-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>scott-la-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>scott-la-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25318</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Scott La</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Specialist Scott La working in the UCSC Molecular Diagnostic Lab.

The lab&#8217;s work to provide local testing for coronavirus infections will be recognized during the <a href="https://scvolunteercenter.org/events-2/be-the-difference-awards/">Be the Difference Awards Watch Party Celebration</a> on Wednesday, October 21, at 12 noon.</p>
<p>UCSC scientists began planning in March to establish a diagnostic testing lab on campus to serve the needs of the community during the COVID-19 pandemic. On May 1, the UCSC Molecular Diagnostic Lab began doing coronavirus tests for the UCSC Student Health Center and other local medical providers. The effort was led by Jeremy Sanford, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental (MCD) biology, Michael Stone, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and Olena Vaske, assistant professor of MCD biology.</p>
<p>In announcing the award, the Volunteer Center wrote, &#8220;We are incredibly grateful to this team of scientists, lab technicians, and researchers who used their expertise to develop processes, procedures, and administration protocol for local COVID-19 testing. In only 4 months they initiated the process for licensing, received approval from federal and state agencies, and developed the capacity to test 400 people per day in a lab they built from scratch.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lab has continued to ramp up its testing capacity and has been processing as many as 500 tests per day in recent weeks. The lab is currently partnering with the UCSC Student Health Center to provide testing for UCSC students and essential campus personnel and with Salud Para la Gente, Santa Cruz Community Health, Encompass Community Services, and the Santa Cruz Sheriff&#8217;s Office, all organizations dedicated to providing testing for the area&#8217;s low-income and vulnerable residents. In addition, the lab partners with Santa Cruz County Public Health and the Santa Cruz Community Foundation to provide testing for various local community medical providers and public service entities.</p>
<p>The UCSC Molecular Diagnostic Lab was one of five winners of the 2020 Be the Difference Awards selected by a team of judges from among 55 nominees.

<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The systemwide proposed plan combines curtailment and salary reduction by requiring that employees take some or all of these days unpaid depending on their salary level.

<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><span>There has been some confusion created by the use of the term &#8220;curtailment&#8221; to describe the President&#8217;s plan. You will see it used throughout the documents from the Office of the President, but please note that Office of the President is referring to a combination of a curtailment and salary reduction by prohibiting some employees from using vacation leave during these curtailment days, depending on salary level. That is why we will describe it as a combined curtailment and salary reduction plan to distinguish it from our campus annual winter curtailment. If approved, these proposed curtailment and salary reduction days would require a campus closure and the campus would take the five days at the same time regardless of use of leave. We do not yet have more detail on the salary tiers.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Proposed 2020-21 Curtailment Program (Proposed by UC Office of the President)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As is the case for the rest of the nation, the University is being impacted by the global pandemic. In addition to challenges in healthcare, education, and other UC operations, we have faced significant economic challenges.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In order to sustain our core mission and purpose, we must make difficult decisions to maintain financial solvency and position the University for future recovery.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This document outlines a proposal to reduce personnel costs through the curtailment of work hours across the University. Each year the University of California observes a minimum curtailment period during the winter break, generally between the holiday period and New Year&#8217;s. This year, we are contemplating an expanded minimum curtailment period in order to address our financial challenges, while minimizing impacts to employees.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As we evaluate options to address UC&#8217;s financial situation, we are keeping the following values in mind:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>We will take a measured approach. </span><span>We will only move forward with a curtailment expansion after implementing other prudent financial savings measures.</span><span><br/><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>We intend to protect as many jobs as possible. </span><span>By taking measured actions early, we hope to stave off the need for furloughs and temporary or permanent layoffs.</span><span><br/><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Impacts will be progressive based on income level</span><span>. Higher-compensated employees will carry a relatively larger percentage of the burden through a tiered plan that protects more vulnerable, lower-wage employees.</span><span><br/><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>This is a moment for shared action</span><span>. The plan describes a systemwide application that impacts every campus and location in some way.</span><span><br/><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>We will maintain flexibility to minimize disruption</span><span>. Essential services to campuses, medical centers and core employee customer service functions that must operate year round will continue during curtailments.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The proposed plan that follows is being shared as part of a consultation process with UC stakeholders to ensure we hear a range of perspectives. </span><span>No decisions have been made</span><span>. Rather, we are sharing these plans to hear from the UC community, including the Academic Senate, Regents and others as we contemplate a minimum five days of curtailment this year.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Curtailment Plan Details</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The proposed curtailment program described below is intended for consideration and discussion. A final decision will come after a 30-day period of consultation with internal UC stakeholders.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Curtailment refers to a period of leave, typically unpaid, instituted in connection with the suspension of certain operations for defined periods of time, including but not limited to periods of time for energy/cost savings; transitional, seasonal, or holiday periods in the academic calendar; or the occurrence of emergency situations that adversely affect normal University operations.</span></p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><span>References to &#8220;salary&#8221; and &#8220;pay&#8221; below are intended to refer to base pay and similar forms of regular pay and stipends unless otherwise exempted. For academic appointees, this would include the scale-based salary, any off-scale, and the above scale salary. For faculty in the Health Sciences Compensation Plan (HSCP), it may include the X and X &#8217;components, but not the negotiated Y and Z components.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Implementation would be contingent upon making all necessary modifications to UCPath to avoid unexpected payroll disruptions.</span></p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Proposed Features</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Under the program, all campuses and the Office of the President would be expected to designate a minimum of five curtailment days (excluding holidays) in fiscal year 2020-21.</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Curtailment periods would be scheduled in a manner so as not to adversely affect instruction or clinical operations and may not necessarily be confined to the holiday period, based on the needs and preferences of our campuses or health centers.</span><span><br/><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>The program would be progressive in the amount of paid and unpaid time off used by a given employee during the minimum five days of curtailment, with higher paid employees shouldering more of the cost. Employees would be grouped into salary tiers, with a different combination of paid and unpaid time off applying to each tier.</span><span><br/><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Employees in the lowest income tier would be permitted to use accrued vacation days for at least five days of the curtailment period. (Employees with insufficient vacation accrual balances would be permitted to use vacation credits prior to their actual accrual.) Higher-earning employees would be permitted to use accrued vacation or other leave for a portion of the curtailment period to varying degrees, based on their income level. Employees in the highest income tier would be required to take at least five curtailment days as unpaid time off and could not use accrued vacation or other paid time off.</span><span><br/><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>For employees without adequate paid time off, the University would grant a grace period to cover the time until paid time off is accrued.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Campuses would identify essential workers who would be exempt from the program &#8211; e.g., medical/clinical staff, or staff deemed essential for the health and safety of students and employees, such as staff needed for COVID deep-cleaning of facilities.</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Unless otherwise exempted, all staff and fiscal-year academic personnel would participate in the program.</span><span><br/><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#160;</span><span>For academic-year faculty, the program would be implemented as an equivalent reduction in salary (based on the salary tiers established under the program) but would not result in additional paid or unpaid time off.</span><span><br/><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#160;</span><span>The University would seek changes to the University of California Retirement Plan or other policies, as needed, to avoid negatively impacting employee retirement benefits.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#160;</span><span>Considerations:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>It will be challenging for some employees to take full advantage of the curtailment days due to the nature of their work obligations. This is particularly true for those faculty whose obligations related to instruction, research, and public service do not conform to standard conventions of days &#8220;at work&#8221; or &#8220;off work.&#8221;</span><span><br/><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Exempt employees will not be allowed to perform any work during the curtailment period in order to comply with provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).</span><span><br/><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">

The additional three curtailment days added to the campus winter break closure does not have a salary reduction component because employees have the option to use vacation and accrued compensatory leave during winter break campus curtailment days.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The systemwide proposed plan combines curtailment and salary reduction by requiring that employees take some or all of these days unpaid depending on their salary level. The plan describes that those in the lowest earning tier would be protected from the salary reduction component of the curtailment through allowances for using accrued vacation leave.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>There has been some confusion created by the use of the term &#8220;curtailment&#8221; to describe the President&#8217;s plan. You will see it used throughout the documents from the Office of the President, but please note that Office of the President is referring to a combination of a curtailment and salary reduction by prohibiting some employees from using vacation leave during these curtailment days, depending on salary level. That is why we will describe it as a combined curtailment and salary reduction plan to distinguish it from our campus annual winter curtailment. If approved, these proposed curtailment and salary reduction days would require a campus closure and the campus would take the five days at the same time regardless of use of leave. We do not yet have more detail on the salary tiers.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Proposed 2020-21 Curtailment Program (Proposed by UC Office of the President)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As is the case for the rest of the nation, the University is being impacted by the global pandemic. In addition to challenges in healthcare, education, and other UC operations, we have faced significant economic challenges.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>In order to sustain our core mission and purpose, we must make difficult decisions to maintain financial solvency and position the University for future recovery.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This document outlines a proposal to reduce personnel costs through the curtailment of work hours across the University. Each year the University of California observes a minimum curtailment period during the winter break, generally between the holiday period and New Year&#8217;s. This year, we are contemplating an expanded minimum curtailment period in order to address our financial challenges, while minimizing impacts to employees.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As we evaluate options to address UC&#8217;s financial situation, we are keeping the following values in mind:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><em>We will take a measured approach. We will only move forward with a curtailment expansion after implementing other prudent financial savings measures.</em><span><br/><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><em>We intend to protect as many jobs as possible. By taking measured actions early, we hope to stave off the need for furloughs and temporary or permanent layoffs.</em><span><br/><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><em>Impacts will be progressive based on income level. Higher-compensated employees will carry a relatively larger percentage of the burden through a tiered plan that protects more vulnerable, lower-wage employees.</em><span><br/><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><em>This is a moment for shared action. The plan describes a systemwide application that impacts every campus and location in some way.</em><span><br/><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><em>We will maintain flexibility to minimize disruption. Essential services to campuses, medical centers and core employee customer service functions that must operate year round will continue during curtailments.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The proposed plan that follows is being shared as part of a consultation process with UC stakeholders to ensure we hear a range of perspectives. </span><span>No decisions have been made</span><span>. Rather, we are sharing these plans to hear from the UC community, including the Academic Senate, Regents and others as we contemplate a minimum five days of curtailment this year.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Curtailment Plan Details</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The proposed curtailment program described below is intended for consideration and discussion. A final decision will come after a 30-day period of consultation with internal UC stakeholders.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Curtailment refers to a period of leave, typically unpaid, instituted in connection with the suspension of certain operations for defined periods of time, including but not limited to periods of time for energy/cost savings; transitional, seasonal, or holiday periods in the academic calendar; or the occurrence of emergency situations that adversely affect normal University operations.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>References to &#8220;salary&#8221; and &#8220;pay&#8221; below are intended to refer to base pay and similar forms of regular pay and stipends unless otherwise exempted. For academic appointees, this would include the scale-based salary, any off-scale, and the above scale salary. For faculty in the Health Sciences Compensation Plan (HSCP), it may include the X and X &#8217;components, but not the negotiated Y and Z components.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Implementation would be contingent upon making all necessary modifications to UCPath to avoid unexpected payroll disruptions.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Proposed Features</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Under the program, all campuses and the Office of the President would be expected to designate a minimum of five curtailment days (excluding holidays) in fiscal year 2020-21.</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Curtailment periods would be scheduled in a manner so as not to adversely affect instruction or clinical operations and may not necessarily be confined to the holiday period, based on the needs and preferences of our campuses or health centers.</span><span><br/><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>The program would be progressive in the amount of paid and unpaid time off used by a given employee during the minimum five days of curtailment, with higher paid employees shouldering more of the cost. Employees would be grouped into salary tiers, with a different combination of paid and unpaid time off applying to each tier.</span><span><br/><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Employees in the lowest income tier would be permitted to use accrued vacation days for at least five days of the curtailment period. (Employees with insufficient vacation accrual balances would be permitted to use vacation credits prior to their actual accrual.) Higher-earning employees would be permitted to use accrued vacation or other leave for a portion of the curtailment period to varying degrees, based on their income level. Employees in the highest income tier would be required to take at least five curtailment days as unpaid time off and could not use accrued vacation or other paid time off.</span><span><br/><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>For employees without adequate paid time off, the University would grant a grace period to cover the time until paid time off is accrued.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Campuses would identify essential workers who would be exempt from the program &#8211; e.g., medical/clinical staff, or staff deemed essential for the health and safety of students and employees, such as staff needed for COVID deep-cleaning of facilities.</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Unless otherwise exempted, all staff and fiscal-year academic personnel would participate in the program.</span><span><br/><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#160;</span><span>For academic-year faculty, the program would be implemented as an equivalent reduction in salary (based on the salary tiers established under the program) but would not result in additional paid or unpaid time off.</span><span><br/><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#160;</span><span>The University would seek changes to the University of California Retirement Plan or other policies, as needed, to avoid negatively impacting employee retirement benefits.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>&#160;Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>It will be challenging for some employees to take full advantage of the curtailment days due to the nature of their work obligations. This is particularly true for those faculty whose obligations related to instruction, research, and public service do not conform to standard conventions of days &#8220;at work&#8221; or &#8220;off work.&#8221;</span><span><br/></span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr"><span>Exempt employees will not be allowed to perform any work during the curtailment period in order to comply with provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).</span><span></span><span></span></li>
<li dir="ltr"><span>Depending on the curtailment periods, changes to the academic calendar may be required.</span></li>

This issue may land on you in various ways. It may mean there will not be a full paycheck or that we will be using up vacation days during this time when there is a higher potential that we might need those days. There is also considerable burden and no relief for staff who are deemed essential, required to work on-campus, and will work through the curtailment period.<br/><br/>In our capacity as the Staff Advisory Board, we will share these and other concerns with our campus and systemwide leadership and request decision-makers to consider alternative plans that take into account the adverse impacts it will have on already strained staff.<br/><br/>We are reaching out to say we appreciate your continued work and dedication during these taxing times and we are working alongside you. Also, we are inviting you to give additional feedback about this or other concerns, which you can do via the <a href="https://sab.ucsc.edu/feedback.php" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Feedback or

Traci Chee, has been named a finalist for the 2020 National Book Award for Young People&#8217;s Literature.</span></p>
<p><span>The book was selected from nearly 1,700 submissions in five categories&#8212;Fiction, Nonfiction, Poetry, Young People&#8217;s Literature and Translated Literature.&#160;</span><span>The five finalists in each category were selected by a panel of literary experts, and the winners will be announced on November 18.</span></p>
<p><span><i>We Are Not Free </i>is an intimate portrayal of 14 San Francisco teenagers whose lives are turned upside down by the forced incarceration of more than 100,000 people of Japanese ancestry during World War II. </span><span>The book includes photographs and documents from the time period, enhancing the impact of a painful and devastating part of America&#8217;s past.</span></p>
<p><span>Chee graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2007, where she studied literature and creative writing, before earning a master of arts degree from San Francisco State University.</span></p>
<p><span>She went on to become a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the young adult fantasy trilogy&#8212;<i>The Reader, The Speaker</i>, and <i>The Storyteller</i>&#8212;which includes a world where books and reading don&#8217;t really exist. </span></p>
<p><span>At a 2017 event in Santa Clara for her first book, <i>The Reader, </i>Chee noted that she was inspired to create that world by an experience she had as a student at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been a lover of books, but it wasn&#8217;t until I was an undergrad in senior year at UC Santa Cruz that I had to take this senior seminar, which was amazing because I was a creative writing major, so instead of writing a thesis or taking a final, we had to make books,&#8221; said Chee. &#8220;We had to write them and actually sew them up together, it was super cool.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;And to help inspire us with this project, our instructor took us to the Special Collections at the McHenry Library at UC Santa Cruz. The librarians there had laid out these really amazing books that I had never thought of as books before. Like there was a book that was made out of a red high-heel shoe, you could open the shoe and it was filled with pages and you could actually read it! There was one that you couldn&#8217;t read but was shaped like a book&#8212;it was made of metal and instead of words, it had all these circuits in it. And I just thought, this is so cool, the possibilities are endless.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I think it actually turned into a line in one of the chapters,&#8221; she added. &#8216;Could anything be a book, if only you knew how to read it?&#8217; That kind of sparked this idea of what else could be a book? How else could we make meaning out of the things that are around us? What other types of literacy can I put into this world that doesn&#8217;t have words or reading and writing the way we have?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Due to the pandemic, the 71st National Book Awards Ceremony on November 18 will be held exclusively online this year. As part of the evening&#8217;s ceremony, acclaimed author Walter Mosley will also receive the National Book Foundation&#8217;s Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.</span></p>

alums</article-subhead><article-text><p>Cell biologist Danesh Moazed, physicist Michael Raymer, and naturalist Chris Lay are being honored by the UC Santa Cruz Division of Physical and Biological Sciences (PBSci) as the recipients of the PBSci Distinguished Alumni Awards.</p>
<p>The division established the awards to honor graduates of the division who have gone on to extraordinary accomplishments in diverse fields and whose careers are characterized by sustained and exemplary contributions to society through research, practice, education, policy, or service.</p>
<p><strong>Danesh Moazed</strong></p>
<p>Danesh Moazed is a professor of cell biology at Harvard Medical School and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. He received both his undergraduate and graduate degrees at UC Santa Cruz, earning a B.A. in biology and Ph.D. in biology. He worked with Harry Noller, the Sinsheimer Professor of Molecular Biology, to investigate the structure and function of the ribosome, and this research led to a remarkable 17 publications.</p>
<p>Moazed&#8217;s postdoctoral research at UCSF focused on molecular mechanisms controlling gene expression. He then joined the faculty at Harvard Medical School, where his lab studies epigenetic inheritance mechanisms and their regulation. He has made key discoveries regarding heterochromatin, a tightly packed form of DNA, and its role in regulation of gene expression. Moazed was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Raymer</strong></p>
<p>Michael Raymer received his B.A. in chemistry and physics at UC Santa Cruz and his Ph.D. in chemical physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He is currently Knight Professor of Liberal Arts and Sciences (Emeritus) at the University of Oregon, having been awarded the chair in 2006 for his pioneering work on the quantum nature of light and its interaction with atoms and molecules.</p>
<p>At UCSC, Raymer was inspired by Chemistry Professor Frank Andrews. His experience as a teaching assistant for Andrews, mentoring and teaching a small group of students, led him to co-found the Science Literacy Program at the University of Oregon on a similar experiential model. In the past decade, the program has introduced this model, along with modern teaching pedagogy, into courses taken by over 21,000 non-science undergraduates. Raymer has created several new courses for non-science majors and has authored two books on physics for a general audience. In addition, his public advocacy efforts, leading to the passage of the National Quantum Initiative Act in 2018, helped make research in quantum information science and technology a national priority.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Lay</strong></p>
<p>As administrative director of the Kenneth Norris Center for Natural History at UC Santa Cruz, Chris Lay has helped transform the center from little more than a repository of natural history collections into a vibrant hub of natural history learning at UC Santa Cruz. He has helped raise nearly $6 million from private donors to support the Norris Center and associated experiential learning field courses, about half of which is an endowment that ensures the long-term future of the center.</p>
<p>Lay earned his B.A. in mathematics at UCSC and an M.S. in conservation biology at San Jose State University. He returned to UCSC as curator of the Natural History Museum in 2008. As a lecturer in environmental studies, he also teaches classes on environmental education, UCSC campus natural history, and museum curation, as well as the department&#8217;s renowned Natural History Field Quarter. He has inspired countless students to pursue careers in natural history and ecology, raising funds for scholarships to cover field course fees and to provide stipends for senior internships to help make these opportunities available to a diversity of students. Lay has also helped to develop connections between UCSC and the broader Santa Cruz natural history community.</p>
<p>The PBSci distinguished alumni will be honored at a virtual awards ceremony to be held in December.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4df7db1f807270171a41329fbb9d7c31"><name>underhill-women-fellowship</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Feminist studies Ph.D. student receives American Association of University Women fellowship</title><summary>The program aims to tackle barriers women face in education by recognizing recipients whose academic work and community projects empower women and girls.</summary><keywords>feminist studies news, ucsc news, uc Santa Cruz news, empowering women, fracking, environmental justice, THI, UCSC Humanities Institute</keywords><start-date>1603332300000</start-date><display-name>Underhill-feminst-fellowship</display-name><path>/2020/10/underhill-women-fellowship</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/10/underhill-women-fellowship</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1603330890498</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1603332846093</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Feminist Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/10/vivian-underhill-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/10/vivian-underhill-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>vivian-underhill-300.jpg</name><display-name>vivian-underhill-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>97016</file-size><width>300</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt>Vivian Underhill in Alaska</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/10/vivian-underhill-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/10/vivian-underhill-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>vivian-underhill-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>vivian-underhill-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23782</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Vivian Underhill in Alaska</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Vivian Underhill worked for the Northern Alaska Environmental Center, a small, grassroots environmental nonprofit in Fairbanks, Alaska, that focuses on economic and climate justice in central and northern Alaska.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Program aims to tackle barriers women face in education</article-subhead><article-text><p><span>Vivian Underhill, a Ph.D. student in feminist studies, has been awarded a 2020-21 fellowship from the <a href="https://www.aauw.org">American Association of University Women</a> (AAUW).</span></p>
<p><span>The fellowships recognize recipients whose academic work and community projects empower women and girls.</span></p>
<p><span>Underhill, who received the AAUW's American Fellowship, is pursuing a doctorate in feminist studies with an emphasis on critical race science studies. Her research focuses on intergenerational environmental-justice activism around fracking and groundwater in California&#8217;s San Joaquin Valley.</span></p>
<p><span>AAUW is one of the world&#8217;s oldest leading supporters of graduate women&#8217;s education. Since 1888, it has awarded more than $115 million in fellowships, grants and awards to 13,000 recipients from more than 105 countries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>For the 2020&#8211;21 academic year, AAUW awarded a total of $3.5 million through seven fellowships and grants programs to more than 200 scholars and community projects and programs promoting education and equity for women and girls.</span></p>
<p><span>"Our fellows and grantees have a long and distinguished history of contributing to their schools, their communities and to society at large,&#8221; said Kim Churches, chief executive officer of AAUW. &#8220;Even in today&#8217;s challenging times, we know that this year&#8217;s recipients will continue in that esteemed tradition.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;AAUW is proud to provide the support they need to excel in their academic work&#8211;and to ultimately make the world a better place,&#8221; she added.</span></p>
<p><span>Underhill was a member of The Humanities Institute&#8217;s inaugural cohort of <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/12/humanities-public-fellows.html"><strong><i>Public Fellows</i></strong></a> at UCSC for the 2016-17 academic year. That role placed her at the Northern Alaska Environmental Center,&#160;where she worked on a grassroots campaign for environmental justice in Northern Alaska.</span></p>
<p><span>She additionally received a UCSC Social Sciences Research Council fellowship grant through the Humanities Institute in 2018-19 to begin her field work in the San Joaquin Valley&#8212;where she interviewed a wide range of people, visited museums and oil fields, and began archival research at the Huntington and Bancroft libraries.</span>&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5128dcc7807270171a41329f29d0aeb0"><name>rolling-out-telecommuting-tools</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Rolling out new telecommuting tools</title><summary>While in many cases, remote work is situational and will eventually return to working on-site, there are other cases in which working remotely, part-time or full-time, can be a long-term model for our employees. </summary><start-date>1603350000000</start-date><display-name>Rolling out new telecommuting tools</display-name><path>/2020/10/rolling-out-telecommuting-tools</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/10/rolling-out-telecommuting-tools</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1603384433823</created-on><last-modified-by>jchafin</last-modified-by><last-modified>1662575412246</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>covid-19-messages</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>
<p>COVID-19 has resulted in broad changes to our operations and how we work. This includes the expansion of employees working remotely from home or other off-site locations. While in many cases, remote work is situational and will eventually return to working on-site, there are other cases in which working remotely, part-time or full-time, can be a long-term model for our employees. Throughout the pandemic, I have received feedback from many employees inquiring about whether remote working arrangements can be expanded permanently. Depending on the specifics of a particular job and the needs of the department, the answer to that question could be yes.</p>
<p>Early in the pandemic, as part of the&#160;<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://recovery.ucsc.edu/assets/images/recovery-resiliency-model.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1603468504549000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFjzut9aeTkzNUIdah2iswZW86_PA" href="https://recovery.ucsc.edu/assets/images/recovery-resiliency-model.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Operations and Employee Recovery and Resiliency Task Force</a>, we launched a Leveraging Opportunities Workgroup. The purpose of this group, chaired by Associate Vice Chancellor for Financial Affairs and Campus Controller Biju Kamaleswaran, was to identify the opportunities that emerge from COVID-19 and the ways in which we can enhance and improve operations long-term based on our successful adaptations. Their first assignment was focused on telecommuting. Through their diligent work, we now have several new tools that support both Situational Telecommuting (i.e., working remotely due to COVID-19 that will not continue long-term) and Routine Telecommuting and Remote Work (i.e., working remotely part-time or full-time that is implemented because it works well long-term for the employee and their department and will continue beyond COVID-19). These tools are outlined below. These new documents supersede the prior Staff HR Manager's Guide and sample agreement that have been in place for several years.&#160;</p>

Using this technique in a mouse model of pneumonia, they were able to gain new insights into the progression of the disease and its interaction with the flu virus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bacterial pneumonia is a lot more common, and more deadly, after a viral infection. Historically, a lot of the deaths during flu outbreaks such as the 1918 pandemic have been attributed to pneumococcal pneumonia,&#8221; said Jacqueline Kimmey, assistant professor of microbiology and environmental toxicology at UC Santa Cruz and co-first author of a paper on the new findings <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.10.001">published October 28 in <em>Cell Host Microbe</em></a>.</p>
<p>Kimmey and her colleagues developed a new method for performing functional gene analysis to identify the genes that drive virulence in <em>S. pneumoniae</em>. Their method builds on the powerful gene editing technology known as CRISPR, which can be modified to selectively silence targeted genes with a technique called CRISPR interference. The researchers created a pooled library of <em>S. pneumoniae</em> strains in which each of the bacteria&#8217;s genes was targeted by CRISPR interference in one of the bacterial strains.</p>
<p>The CRISPR interference system was inducible by the antibiotic doxycycline, so the genes were not silenced until the bacteria (which were resistant to the antibiotic) were introduced into mice given doxycycline-containing feed. In addition, a genetic &#8220;barcode&#8221; on the guide RNAs used to target the silenced genes enabled the researchers to easily track each strain after infection. With a single sequencing step, they could identify which strains had survived and caused infections in the mice.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very efficient way to shut off individual genes and find out which ones are important,&#8221; Kimmey explained.</p>
<p><strong>Infection bottleneck</strong></p>
<p>The system also enabled the researchers to assess a crucial phase of the infection when most of the bacteria die off. Only a small number of bacteria survive this &#8220;bottleneck&#8221; and go on to cause invasive disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lungs are actually really good at clearing infection,&#8221; Kimmey said. &#8220;Even when we gave mice quite a high load of bacteria, there was a huge bottleneck, and very few bacteria made it into the blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers estimated that as few as 25 bacterial cells could survive the bottleneck and cause disease. They also found a surprising amount of variation in the outcome of the bottleneck, even though the mice were genetically identical and were infected through a carefully controlled protocol. The effects of the bottleneck overshadowed the gene silencing effects, resulting in little difference between the control mice and those in which bacterial genes were silenced.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no consistency in terms of which strains survived, and there was huge variability in the size of the bottleneck,&#8221; Kimmey said. &#8220;We know there is a lot of variability in the clinical progression of the disease in humans, so it is very exciting to see so much variation in this highly controlled system.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers then added flu to the system, infecting the mice with type A influenza prior to introducing <em>S. pneumoniae</em>. In mice pre-infected with influenza, there was no bottleneck, and a relatively small dose of bacteria caused rampant infection in the lungs. This enabled the researchers to assess the effects of gene silencing on the virulence of the bacteria.</p>
<p>The results pointed to several genes as having important roles in pneumococcal infections, including genes identified as virulence factors in previous studies, such as the bacterial capsule genes. Surprisingly, the gene for the bacteria&#8217;s main toxin, pneumolysin, did not appear to be necessary for the development of infections. Together with other recent findings, this suggests that pneumolysin may be more important for transmission than for survival in the host, the researchers said.</p>
<p>A mysterious aspect of <em>S. pneumoniae</em> infections is that it is a very common colonizer of the upper respiratory tract without causing disease in most people.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really don&#8217;t know what controls that,&#8221; Kimmey said. &#8220;There seems to be a large population of people who are colonized, and normally that&#8217;s okay. But a viral infection may predispose them and increase the risk of bacterial pneumonia.&#8221;</p>
<p>To get a better understanding of the variable outcomes seen in this study, Kimmey said she plans to use the CRISPR interference system to study the progression of infections in greater detail. In clinical settings, variability in the progression of disease can be attributed to a wide range of factors. In this controlled study, the process of infection itself seemed to be highly variable.</p>
<p>&#8220;The system we developed gave us a very elegant way of showing the variability of outcomes and what seems like random variation in the course of infections, even in a controlled system,&#8221; she said.</p>

It was an ambitious project that ended up requiring more lab work than the team could complete in nine short months, so this year&#8217;s team decided to continue where their predecessors had left off. They assembled in January, led by Baskin Engineering students Melody Azimi and Sophia Sneddon and advised by David Bernick, assistant adjunct professor of biomolecular engineering.<br/><br/>Then the pandemic hit.<br/><br/>As campus shut down all in-person classes in mid-March, the iGEM team realized that the small and enclosed biosafety room that they were required to use to work on a virus like Newcastle would make social distancing difficult. The team quickly switched gears to a new project that they believed would be more feasible during the pandemic while still doing good for the planet: creating a cellulose-based biodegradable plastic for strawberry growers.<br/><br/>&#8220;If you go to Salinas or Gilroy you will see this black overlay of plastic stretching for acres and acres of land,&#8221; Azimi explains. &#8220;California grows 88% of the strawberries in America, so our plastic use in agriculture is very high. We want to be able to reduce that.&#8221;<br/><br/>Plastic coverings are a necessary part of strawberry growing, but regular polyethylene plastics break down into microplastics that are damaging to the environment. A cellulose-based plastic, on the other hand, would break down into glucose monomers that the microbes in soil could use as nutrients. This would allow farmers to simply till the plastic into the soil at the end of the growing season, keeping it out of landfills.<br/><br/>While iGEM 2020 was out of the lab at the beginning of the pandemic, they spent time researching their new project and what farmers needed in a plastic overlay. They spoke with experts in fumigation, plastics, and strawberry pathology, but one of their most motivating contacts was Mark Bolda, strawberry and caneberry farm advisor for Santa Cruz County. Bolda is working on a multi-state project to show growers biodegradable plastics, and told the team that once they were able to create a prototype, he would test it for them.<br/><br/>&#8220;He really wants to get this product out there. It was really exciting to hear from professionals how amazed they are that undergrads are working on something like this,&#8221; Azimi says. &#8220;They like that we are thinking outside of the box. That was really encouraging.&#8221;<br/><br/>Once the team was allowed back into the lab, with strict social distancing requirements and bi-weekly testing, they went to work on the wet-lab component of their project. Now they are racing against the clock to complete the difficult task of decrystallizing cellulose so they can make it flexible enough to add a plasticizing agent to it.<br/><br/>&#8220;It is something that people have tried before and spent years on,&#8221; Sneddon says. &#8220;Our strategy is different, and we are hoping that it works, but that is the biggest hurdle that we have to overcome.&#8221;<br/><br/>Multiple interruptions have made this effort even more difficult. Several months into the pandemic, the whole team had to quarantine when one of their members tested positive for Covid-19. Luckily the person was asymptomatic and strict safety procedures kept the rest of the team from being infected, but it kept them out of the lab for two weeks. Shortly after they returned, the whole campus had to evacuate for a week as wildfires raged dangerously close.<br/><br/>During these disruptions, the team was able to rally to complete work that could be done remotely, but the ongoing strain of the pandemic and the wildfires forced Azimi and Sneddon to step up their leadership in a way that would normally not be required for an undergraduate research project.<br/><br/>&#8220;What I have learned more than anything this year was how to handle the emotional side of managing projects with teammates who have to deal with heavy stuff,&#8221; Sneddon says. &#8220;It is a hard thing to learn, and I think this year has made me really grow in that way because you are dealing with things you wouldn&#8217;t normally handle in an iGEM year.&#8221;<br/><br/>With the new challenges has also come the opportunity for camaraderie, however. Azimi, who had the experience of being a member of the iGEM 2019 team before leading iGEM 2020, says that one of the biggest positive differences this year has been better communication between teammates as they have worked to compensate for having fewer people physically in the lab.<br/><br/>&#8220;I feel like I knew my teammates a lot more, so I think that is the best thing that could have happened out of 2020,&#8221; Azimi says. Sneddon agrees, noting, &#8220;The best part of doing iGEM this year has been not having to go through the pandemic and the fires and quarantine alone.&#8221;<br/><br/>Normally at this time of year, the team would be gearing up to travel to the iGEM Jamboree that is typically held at the end of October, but this year the competition has been postponed to November and will be entirely virtual. The team is looking forward to being able to present their work, but whatever the outcome, the experience of being a part of iGEM has provided them with an opportunity to learn and grow as researchers during an otherwise difficult year.<br/><br/>&#8220;It has been very challenging,&#8221; Sneddon says. &#8220;We have definitely felt the bad side of 2020, but we have gotten through it and we have done a lot of work toward our product. It has been inspiring to see our team work so hard.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5742f50a807270171a41329f8456df04"><name>czu-fire-survey</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus conducting post-CZU Fire community experience survey</title><start-date>1603436400000</start-date><display-name>Campus conducting post-CZU Fire community experience survey</display-name><path>/2020/10/czu-fire-survey</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/10/czu-fire-survey</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1603486807276</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1603486807276</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Campus Updates</value><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span>The campus is conducting a Post-CZU Fire Campus Community Experiences Survey.

<p>People with this condition are unable to fall asleep until late at night (often after 2 a.m.) and have difficulty getting up in the morning. In 2017, scientists discovered a surprisingly common mutation that causes this sleep disorder by altering a key component of the biological clock that maintains the body&#8217;s daily rhythms. The new findings, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/10/23/1920653117">published October 26 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>, reveal the molecular mechanisms involved and point the way toward potential treatments.</p>
<p>&#8220;This mutation has dramatic effects on people&#8217;s sleep patterns, so it&#8217;s exciting to identify a concrete mechanism in the biological clock that links the biochemistry of this protein to the control of human sleep behavior,&#8221; said corresponding author Carrie Partch, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Daily cycles in virtually every aspect of our physiology are driven by cyclical interactions of clock proteins in our cells. Genetic variations that change the clock proteins can alter the timing of the clock and cause sleep phase disorders. A shortened clock cycle causes people to go to sleep and wake up earlier than normal (the &#8220;morning lark&#8221; effect), while a longer clock cycle makes people stay up late and sleep in (the &#8220;night owl&#8221; effect).</p>
<p>Most of the mutations known to alter the clock are very rare, Partch said. They are important to scientists as clues to understanding the mechanisms of the clock, but a given mutation may only affect one in a million people. The genetic variant identified in the 2017 study, however, was found in around one in 75 people of European descent.</p>
<p>How often this particular mutation is involved in delayed sleep phase disorder remains unclear, Partch said. Sleep behavior is complex&#8212;people stay up late for many different reasons&#8212;and disorders can be hard to diagnose. So the discovery of a relatively common genetic variation associated with a sleep phase disorder was a striking development.</p>
<p>&#8220;This genetic marker is really widespread,&#8221; Partch said. &#8220;We still have a lot to understand about the role of lengthened clock timing in delayed sleep onset, but this one mutation is clearly an important cause of late night behavior in humans.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Clock proteins</strong></p>
<p>The mutation affects a protein called cryptochrome, one of four main clock proteins. Two of the clock proteins (CLOCK and BMAL1) form a complex that turns on the genes for the other two (period and cryptochrome), which then combine to repress the activity of the first pair, thus turning themselves off and starting the cycle again. This feedback loop is the central mechanism of the biological clock, driving daily fluctuations in gene activity and protein levels throughout the body.</p>
<p>The cryptochrome mutation causes a small segment on the &#8220;tail&#8221; of the protein to get left out, and Partch&#8217;s lab found that this changes how tightly cryptochrome binds to the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex.</p>
<p>&#8220;The region that gets snipped out actually controls the activity of cryptochrome in a way that leads to a 24-hour clock,&#8221; Partch explained. &#8220;Without it, cryptochrome binds more tightly and stretches out the length of the clock each day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The binding of these protein complexes involves a pocket where the missing tail segment normally competes and interferes with the binding of the rest of the complex.</p>
<p>&#8220;How tightly the complex partners bind to this pocket determines how quickly the clock runs,&#8221; Partch explained. &#8220;This tells us we should be looking for drugs that bind to that pocket and can serve the same purpose as the cryptochrome tail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Partch&#8217;s lab is currently doing just that, conducting screening assays to identify molecules that bind to the pocket in the clock&#8217;s molecular complex. &#8220;We know now that we need to target that pocket to develop therapeutics that could shorten the clock for people with delayed sleep phase disorder,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Partch has been studying the molecular structures and interactions of the clock proteins for years. In a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/02/clock-mutations.html">study published earlier this year</a>, her lab showed how certain mutations can shorten clock timing by affecting a molecular switch mechanism, making some people extreme morning larks.</p>
<p>She said the new study was inspired by the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.03.027">2017 paper on the cryptochrome mutation</a> from the lab of Nobel Laureate Michael Young at Rockefeller University. The paper had just come out when first author Gian Carlo Parico joined Partch&#8217;s lab as a graduate student, and he was determined to discover the molecular mechanisms responsible for the mutation&#8217;s effects.</p>
<p>In addition to Parico and Partch, the coauthors of the new paper include Ivette Perez, Jennifer Fribourgh, and Britney Hernandez, all members of Partch&#8217;s lab at UCSC, and Hsiau-Wei Lee, manager of the UCSC NMR Facility. This research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and an HHMI Gilliam Fellowship for Parico.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/02/clock-mutations.html</url><title>Molecular

featuring a wide variety of works performed at the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Titled <i>Digitizing the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music: Putting Experimental Music in Conversation with Classical</i>, the project preserves and now makes available live Festival performances from 1964 to 1990, featuring works by such experimental artists as John Cage, Annea Lockwood, and Lou Harrison.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The recordings were drawn from both the Festival archives, which were donated to Special Collections in 1997, as well as the Bay Area music non-profit organization, Other Minds, which donated additional tapes to Special Collections in 2016. The reel-to-reel tape format is particularly susceptible to degradation, and this project has ensured that the recordings have been preserved for future use.</span></p>
<p><span>Founded in 1963, the Cabrillo Festival is distinctive in its focus on contemporary symphonic music by living composers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;These recordings document the critical role the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music played in shaping local culture and national practices surrounding classical and contemporary music,&#8221; said Madison Heying, who received a Ph.D. in Cultural Musicology at UC Santa Cruz and co-wrote the grant application with Special Collections &amp; Archives.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;One of the first music festivals to program contemporary, experimental, and world music alongside standard classical repertoire, the Festival became an important nexus for conductors, composers, performers, and the public.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>This project was supported by the&#160;Recordings at Risk program&#8212;a national re-granting program administered by the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) and funded by&#160;The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation&#8212;to support the preservation of rare and unique audio and audiovisual content of high scholarly value.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We are delighted to make this unique resource available to the UCSC community and the public at large,&#8221; said Kate Dundon, Supervisory Archivist at the Library&#8217;s Special Collections and Archives. &#8220;It is especially significant that these recordings can now be accessed online while we are teaching and learning remotely.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;A pillar of contemporary music and local community catalyst, the Cabrillo Festival has been bringing people together for over 50 years. We hope we can strengthen that community spirit during this unprecedented&#160;time by making these recordings available to the world,&#8221; she added.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Dundon noted that digitizing 670 reel-to-reel tapes and making them accessible online was quite an ambitious undertaking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The pandemic and wildfire certainly didn't help, but our project team worked together to&#160;overcome these challenges with the support of the CLIR Foundation and Elizabeth Cowell, our University Librarian and the principal investigator for the grant,&#8221; said Dundon. &#8220;Overall, the project took one and a half years to complete, but it was well worth the time and effort.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>The recordings are now discoverable on the <a href="https://digitalcollections.library.ucsc.edu/collections/9s1618671?locale=en"><em><strong>University Library Digital Media Collection</strong></em></a> site. Due to copyright restrictions, immediate streaming access is limited to UCSC affiliates. All other interested users&#8212;including researchers and the general public&#8212;may search and browse performance descriptions and request access from Special Collections.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>This marks the second grant that UC Santa Cruz has received from the CLIR to preserve the Cabrillo Festival tapes. Recordings from festival seasons 1991-2003 were previously digitized and are also available upon request.</span><span></span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="65953ab8807270171a41329f5b19daa4"><name>planned-power-outage-announced-for-santa-cruz-county</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Planned power outage announced for Santa Cruz County</title><summary>Pacific Gas and Electric Co. announced late Friday that it will likely preemptively cut power tonight to a large swath of Central and Northern California, including parts of Santa Cruz County, to prevent power lines from sparking wildfires during dry and extremely windy weather forecast for later this week.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Forrest Stuart has built his career pursuing burning questions about the societal underpinnings of poverty and criminalization across disciplines. Now, his most recent accolade, a $625,000 funding award from the MacArthur Foundation, places him among a select group of the nation's top change-makers and creative thinkers.</p>
<p>Stuart said his research focus has been influenced both by his childhood and the formative experiences of his undergraduate education at University of California, Santa Cruz, where he earned his bachelor's in politics in 2004. During his youth, Stuart's hometown of San Bernardino had some of the highest poverty and per-capita homicide rates in the country.</p>
<p>"Growing up, these things were kind of normalized," Stuart recalled. "And then, arriving at UC Santa Cruz, some of the classes I took hit me like a ton of bricks. It was the first time in my life where I was able to trace events, like my friend's father being gunned down, to the legacies of policies."</p>
<p>Stuart felt a deep sense of anger, but also empowerment. He started thinking about the role he could play in changing policy decisions and cultural ideologies for the better. And as he began charting his academic path toward that outcome, a lecturer in one of his UC Santa Cruz contemporary political theory courses offered some advice that still sticks with him.</p>
<p>"I remember he told me to figure out what your big question is in life, then think about everything you read and every class you take as getting you closer to finding an answer to that question," Stuart said. "It gave me this entirely new framework. Find that question, then figure out what it takes to answer that question, and follow that path."</p>
<p>Stuart's central questions in life were very clear. He wanted to understand the societal issues affecting communities like his hometown, and he wanted to find solutions. In his first book, <i>Down, Out and Under Arrest: Policing and Everyday Life in Skid Row</i>, Stuart documented the effects of the first five years of the Safer Cities Initiative on the community of Los Angeles's Skid Row. His second book, <i>Ballad of the Bullet: Gangs, Drill Music, and the Power of Online Infamy</i>, explored the role of social media in the lives of gang-associated youth in Chicago.</p>
<p>The MacArthur win will be crucial to supporting the next steps in Stuart's work. He hopes to return to Chicago and collaborate with social workers and photographers to shift the focus from young men engaged in urban violence to the women in their lives. This work will involve community members as co-producers of knowledge and provide trauma-informed services in that process.</p>
<p>Part of Stuart's unique impact comes from his deeply humanistic and immersive approach, and the MacArthur win has offered strong validation for that vision. In his current role, as an associate professor in the Department of Sociology at Stanford University and director of the Stanford Ethnography Lab, Stuart is hard at work training the next generation of sociologists. One of the lessons he passes along is that the search for solutions always starts at the personal level.</p>
<p>"Social forces and social processes, no matter how big they may seem, are always made in these micro moments," Stuart said. "We can't get to that unless we build intimate relationships with people."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="66efc810807270171a41329f100c637f"><name>big-ideas-contest</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Big Ideas contest offers up to $20,000 for big ideas in social innovation</title><summary>Big Ideas contest, open to all UC students, seeks student-led, early-stage projects or ideas with a social impact focus. </summary><start-date>1603749600000</start-date><display-name>Big Ideas contest</display-name><path>/2020/10/big-ideas-contest</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/10/big-ideas-contest</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1603749791731</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1603751036956</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/10/images/big-ideas-banner-400.png</path><link>site://news/2020/10/images/big-ideas-banner-400.png</link><site>news</site><name>big-ideas-banner-400.png</name><display-name>big-ideas-banner-400.png</display-name><file-size>53163</file-size><width>400</width><height>209</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Big Ideas is the University of California&#8217;s leading early-stage social innovation competition.

A new genetic analysis, however, shows that the timing of migration in Chinook salmon is determined entirely by differences in one short stretch of DNA in their genomes.</p>
<p>The new findings, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6516/609">published October 29 in <em>Science</em></a>, mean that within a drainage basin like the Klamath River, the different runs of Chinook salmon are all part of a single diverse population.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like blue and brown eye color in humans&#8212;it just depends on what genotype you inherit from your parents,&#8221; said corresponding author John Carlos Garza, adjunct professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz and a research geneticist with NOAA&#8217;s Southwest Fisheries Science Center.</p>
<p>The study has profound implications for conservation and management of Chinook salmon, the largest species of salmon, and makes restoration of the beleaguered Klamath River spring run more feasible if plans for the removal of dams on the river move forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;We view this as very good news,&#8221; Garza said.</p>
<p><strong>Genome sequencing</strong></p>
<p>Garza&#8217;s team began by sequencing the complete genomes of 160 Chinook salmon from the Klamath River and Sacramento River drainages. The only consistent differences they found between spring-run and fall-run fish occurred within a single region on chromosome 28. Within that region, they identified a shorter &#8220;Region of Strongest Association&#8221; (RoSA) that occurs in two versions, dubbed &#8220;E&#8221; for early migration and &#8220;L&#8221; for late migration.</p>
<p>RoSA includes parts of two genes and the stretch of DNA between them. The E and L versions differ in multiple places, making them &#8220;haplotypes,&#8221; the term for a set of DNA variations that are inherited together. Salmon, like all vertebrates, inherit two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent, so their RoSA &#8220;genotype&#8221; can be either EE, LL, or EL.</p>
<p>Armed with genetic markers for the E and L haplotypes, the researchers sampled 502 Chinook salmon harvested by the Yurok Tribe in the Klamath River Estuary. For fish with the &#8220;homozygous&#8221; EE and LL genotypes, there was no overlap in the timing of migration, when the fish leave the ocean to swim up the Klamath and spawn. EE fish migrate early (spring run), and LL fish migrate later (fall run).</p>
<p>Fish with the &#8220;heterozygous&#8221; EL genotype had intermediate migration times, overlapping with those of the homozygous genotypes. The migration times of EL salmon were skewed toward the spring run, but some overlapped with fall-run salmon.</p>
<p>According to Garza, these results show that seasonal differences in migration are completely attributable to the RoSA genetic variants. &#8220;That was an extraordinary finding,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I know of no other gene region that so completely determines a complex migratory behavior in the wild in a vertebrate.&#8221;</p>
<p>This finding is especially striking because people have long noted differences between spring-run and fall-run salmon in their fat content and other features, which were presumed to be part of a suite of heritable traits characterizing the different runs. But in fact, Garza said, all those differences are tied to the timing of migration as determined by the RoSA genotype.</p>
<p>Spring-run salmon enter freshwater early in the year, where they encounter different environmental conditions, notably warmer water, which likely accelerates their maturation. The fish spend the summer in cool, deep pools near their spawning habitat before spawning in the fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;People notice differences in fat content and body condition because they are encountering spring-run fish earlier in the maturation process than fall-run fish,&#8221; Garza said. &#8220;Spring-run and fall-run fish all start maturing at the same time in the ocean, but during that period after the spring run enters freshwater, they experience different environmental conditions, leading to differences in where and when they spawn.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the researchers sampled the carcasses of salmon that had died after spawning in the Salmon River, a major tributary of the Klamath, they found evidence that the spring-run and fall-run salmon were freely interbreeding. The ratios of EE, LL, and EL genotypes were close to what would be expected for random mating patterns. Garza noted that if two EL fish mate, their offspring will include EE, LL, and EL fish.</p>
<p>In other words, a spring-run salmon can have a fall-run sibling.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to come up with any scenario where you could classify individuals from the same nest as belonging to different populations,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For me, one of the underlying messages is that, in our attempt to categorize things, we&#8217;ve overlooked the fact that these are fundamentally the same animal.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers extended their survey of post-spawning carcasses to rivers throughout northern California and the Siletz River in Oregon. Again, they found that heterozygous (EL) fish were widespread where early-migrating fish occur and suitable habitat for them exists.</p>
<p><strong>Ancestral genes</strong></p>
<p>The researchers also found that the RoSA haplotypes are the same in all the Chinook salmon lineages found in different rivers, indicating that they predate the evolution of genetically distinct lineages adapted to specific drainages along the coast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those haplotypes are ancestrally the same everywhere, which is good news because it means that there are no variants related to the spring-run migration trait that have been lost with the extirpation of the historically abundant spring run in the upper Klamath River,&#8221; Garza said.</p>
<p>Dams have blocked migrating salmon from the upper reaches of the Klamath River since 1912. Salmon lineages that used to spawn in the upper Klamath now stop at the Iron Gate Dam and spawn below there. The dams also reduced the cool-water habitat needed by spring-run salmon to survive during the summer, selecting against the EE and EL genotypes. But Garza&#8217;s team found that Chinook salmon with the genetic traits for local adaptation to the upper Klamath still persist below the dam.</p>
<p>&#8220;It highlights the importance of taking those dams out, because descendants of the historic upper Klamath spring run are still there&#8212;they&#8217;ve just lost the E haplotype,&#8221; Garza said. &#8220;Simple crossing with other populations in the Klamath to put the E haplotype back into the genetic background of upper Klamath Chinook salmon could restore that spring run.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prior to COVID, we anticipated a permanent campus budget of $830 million for the budget year that began July 1, 2020. Today, a more realistic budget estimate is $671 million, reflecting a projected revenue loss of $159 million for fiscal year 2021. The two main components of this revenue decrease are a $20 million reduction in state funding to our core budget, which supports teaching, research and campus infrastructure, and a projected revenue loss of $130 million in campus sales and service operations, including auxiliary operations like housing, dining, transportation and parking, and other units that generate their own revenue. Similar reductions in revenue are being realized across the UC system with each campus addressing this challenge with approaches unique to their circumstances.</p>
<p>At UCSC we plan to make up the $20 million reduction in state funding using one-time funds rather than making permanent cuts. The campus entered this crisis in a sound financial position, and we have taken important steps to adapt to the evolving budgetary situation by limiting hiring and controlling other expenses. We have proposed a plan that would take $12 million in cuts centrally and distribute the remaining $8 million across the divisions. Importantly, these are not permanent budget cuts and divisions can address their target using a combination of savings from unfilled positions, foregone travel and operational costs or uncommitted year-end cash balances. By choosing to absorb this revenue loss with one-time funds, we can better support the academic experience and services provided to all students, consistent with our mission as a student-focused research university.</p>
<p>Though the projected revenue losses for the campus sales and service operations are substantial, we expect that the financial picture of most auxiliary units will rebound when we are able to repopulate campus, so our focus is on stabilization. In addition to the budgetary impacts, as campus operations have adjusted to fewer students, no in-person events, reduced travel, and a host of other changes in response to COVID-19, many units are facing service-level impacts and a reduction in workload. Our guiding principle continues to be to keep as many staff members as fully deployed as possible and to keep indefinite layoffs to a minimum throughout this pandemic.</p>
<p>To help keep staff whose work has been reduced, we have launched a<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://shr.ucsc.edu/resources-forms/uc-santa-cruz-employee-redeployment-program-for-ay-2020-2021/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1604078040131000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFjppsNQ8TofziiqtUFFbkBmc3PWw" href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/resources-forms/uc-santa-cruz-employee-redeployment-program-for-ay-2020-2021/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">redeployment program</a>. This program is designed to offer staff who receive temporary layoff notices the option to be reassigned temporarily to other work on campus, while we anticipate recovery from the pandemic. The initial response from units across the university to identify such opportunities includes a number of possible projects including deep cleaning, sanitization and maintenance, document scanning, data or financial analysis, communications, IT and more. We expect additional projects will be added over the coming weeks. The way that the redeployment program works is that an employee who receives a temporary layoff notice due to service level reductions can express interest in temporary redeployment through June 30, 2021. Staff Human Resources will help match employees seeking a reassignment with redeployment opportunities.</p>

<p>As the days grow shorter, I am anticipating the time change on Nov. 1 (after all, who doesn't need an extra hour of sleep at this point in the quarter?) and I find myself thinking often about the election. I have already cast my ballot by mail.

The hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday, Nov. 2, and 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday, Nov. 3. There is also an official ballot drop-off box in front of the Bay Tree Bookstore. While the pundits warn that we may not know the outcome of the presidential race on Nov. 3, I am confident that our democracy is sufficiently robust that the will of the people will prevail.</p>

<p>UC Santa Cruz has shown extraordinary resilience in adapting to the unexpected challenges and rapidly changing conditions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. I am especially proud of our faculty, staff and students who stood up the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory to provide COVID-19 testing for our campus and to meet the needs of our greater Santa Cruz County community. It was heartwarming to learn last week that the lab was recognized by the Santa Cruz County Volunteer Center with a<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DnrL_TKryZxQ&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1604078040131000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFeZl5yMnOaB0a9mTQ1-7p28F7FbQ" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrL_TKryZxQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Be the Difference Award</a>.</p>
<p>I am also proud of our students and employees for their commitment to the well-being of our community by participating in COVID-19 testing, as we know that along with wearing masks and avoiding gatherings, testing and contact tracing are key to controlling the spread of the virus. Students living on campus are required to be tested. Free asymptomatic testing is also available on a voluntary basis to students living off-campus and to employees. Last week our team performed 1,487 tests of 1,360 students and 127 staff, with<span>&#160;</span><strong>ZERO</strong><span>&#160;</span>positive results for the third week in a row!

<p dir="ltr"><span>UC is offering the same high-quality health plans as last year, with minimal increases in premiums &#8212; ranging from $0 to $12 per month. There are a few important changes you should know about, including increases to some medical plan cost-sharing amounts, a new administrator for Flexible Spending Accounts and enhancements to legal insurance benefits. Now is the time to make decisions around your coverage for next year. If you decide that your health and welfare benefits should remain unchanged your benefits will continue for most plans. As always, if you want to continue participation in Health and Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA), enrollment is required annually during Open Enrollment.</span></p>

Es momento de tomar decisiones sobre su cobertura para el a&#241;o que viene. Si decide no hacer ning&#250;n cambio en sus beneficios m&#233;dicos y de bienestar, se mantendr&#225;n sus beneficios en la mayor&#237;a de los planes. Como siempre, si quiere seguir participando en las cuentas de gastos flexibles (FSA) para atenci&#243;n m&#233;dica y atenci&#243;n de dependientes, debe inscribirse cada a&#241;o en la inscripci&#243;n abierta.</span></p>
