<p>Funded by a five-year $30 million grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the new collaborative is establishing the Center of Excellence for Water (COE-Water), an interdisciplinary applied research and education center located at Alexandria University in Egypt.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz will lead the research effort, with a focus on water supply and securing funding for research. Exchange programs will foster collaboration among Egyptian scholars, water professionals, government representatives, and students with their counterparts in the United States.</p>
<p>"For its population, Egypt is one of the most water poor countries in the world," said Brent Haddad, a professor of environmental studies who is leading the UCSC program. "The focus of this effort is very clear: Improve Egypt's applied research enterprise to make a difference in the lives of Egyptians, and bolster educational opportunities that will prepare students for careers in the water sector."</p>
<p>"The goal is to connect research and teaching with employment opportunities and industry," said Haddad.</p>
<p>In addition to UCSC and American University in Cairo (AUC), the lead institution (which is based in New York), the other U.S. universities are Washington State University, Utah State University, and Temple University. Each campus will play a different role in the initiative, including developing the governance structure of the COE, building the research portfolio, facilitating student and faculty exchanges, and developing curriculum. In addition to Alexandria University, Egyptian partners include some of the nation's largest public universities: Ain Shams University, Aswan University, Beni Suef University, and Zagazig University. The Center for Excellence is one of three such centers funded by USAID and housed at an Egyptian public university; the others focus on energy and agriculture.</p>
<p>Haddad, who has more than 20 years experience in urban water management, said he isn't taking a "top down" approach to the project. Rather, he said, the starting point will be the existing body of research and planning that has already taken place in Egypt.</p>
<p>"We shouldn't discount the excellent research and planning that has already occurred in Egypt," he said. "We need to find ways to integrate cutting-edge water research that's practical. We need solutions to Egypt's actual water problems."</p>
<p>The impacts of climate change on Egyptian natural resources and new water-treatment technologies&#8212;including reuse and desalination&#8212;will be part of the discussion, noted Haddad.</p>
<p>"Some technologies that aren't widely used in the U.S. could be a better match for Egypt," he said. Unlike the U.S., where large water-treatment plants are the norm, Egypt may be better suited to deploying a large number of small water-treatment plants that use different technology. UCSC's share of the USAID funding, which is about $2 million, includes money to connect UCSC professors and graduate students with Egyptian researchers, as well as to host Egyptian students at UCSC.</p>
<p>Haddad will oversee development of a National Water Research Needs Agenda, a comprehensive effort that will begin with a literature review and surveys of government, university, and industry leaders about water research. The UCSC team will also sponsor webinars for broadcast to Egyptian universities on targeted topics, including one on the water-management challenges at antiquities and national parks, including the pyramids and temples on the upper Nile River.</p>
<p>UCSC will also lead the production of several papers on research practices and access in Egypt, addressing topics that include increasing women's access to research careers in water in Egypt.&#160;In addition, Haddad's team has been charged with organizing and managing about 40 small-, medium-, and large-scale research projects at Egyptian public universities. Haddad has already established a Committee on Research and Policy, made up of Egyptians and U.S. partners, to help implement this aspect of the project.</p>
<p>In December, Haddad hosted his counterparts from U.S. universities for a planning meeting, and this spring a team of 10 Egyptian water leaders will travel first to Washington D.C. and then to UC Santa Cruz for a three-day meeting where they will hear from senior academic and industry water experts and finalize a national water "research roadmap."</p>
<p>As Haddad approaches the one-year mark of the initiative, he is optimistic that it will have the impact he desires. "We're establishing a technology-readiness hierarchy for deployment in the water sector," he said. "It's very exciting."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7cfc8cbd8072701710975c5acc685f90"><name>ward-career-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Biologist Jordan Ward wins NSF CAREER Award</title><summary>Jordan Ward, assistant professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, has received a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award from the National Science Foundation.</summary><start-date>1578384000000</start-date><display-name>Biologist Jordan Ward wins NSF CAREER Award</display-name><path>/2020/01/ward-career-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/01/ward-career-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1578349923489</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1578414095753</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/01/images/jordan-ward-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/01/images/jordan-ward-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jordan-ward-350.jpg</name><display-name>jordan-ward-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>92982</file-size><width>350</width><height>393</height></image><image-alt>Jordan Ward</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/01/images/jordan-ward-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/01/images/jordan-ward-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jordan-ward-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>jordan-ward-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25762</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Jordan Ward</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Jordan Ward (photo by C.

<p>Ward&#8217;s lab uses the worm <em>C. elegans</em> as a model organism to study gene regulation in animal development. In particular, he is interested in the control of gene expression by transcription factors and the regulatory pathways driving the remarkable series of events that transform germ cells into sperm. The work funded by the CAREER Award is designed to identify conserved regulators of spermatogenesis across species and also novel genes that promote unique aspects in nematodes, which can shed light on the evolution of spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>This research project is tightly integrated with Ward&#8217;s efforts to improve retention of underrepresented students in science and to promote undergraduate access to meaningful research experiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;This research will be driven by undergraduates through a program I developed to support junior transfer students,&#8221; Ward said. &#8220;I teach an upper division molecular biology course (Biology 101) that is a required core class for our biology majors, and I found that junior transfer students were doing more poorly than their non-transfer counterparts, a trend also observed in other classes. We&#8217;re realizing that these students can slip through the cracks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ward&#8217;s program, called DREAM (Developing Researchers, Educators, and Mentors), involves recruiting four junior transfer students annually (the DREAM team) to perform research on spermatogenesis in his lab. The DREAM team will also get training to mentor incoming junior transfer students the following academic year, conducting small-group, peer-led tutoring during Ward&#8217;s class.</p>
<p>Ward will connect with incoming junior transfer students when they arrive on campus to tell them about his research and become a point of contact for them. The DREAM program aims to increase retention and academic success of junior transfer students, involve them in research, create community, build identity, and help them navigate their journey to a UC Santa Cruz biology degree.</p>
<p>The CAREER Awards are NSF's most prestigious awards in support of early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and to lead advances in the mission of their department or organization. The award provides $675,000 over five years to support Ward&#8217;s research, education, and outreach activities.</p>
<p>Ward earned his B.S. and M.S. degrees in microbiology at the University of Alberta and his Ph.D. in biochemistry at the University of London. After doing postdoctoral research at UCSF, he joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 2016.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7d138b038072701710975c5af3ca166f"><name>seismic-safety</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Update on UCâ€™s seismic safety initiative</title><summary>The safety of our campus community is our highest priority and reflected in our continuous work to improve seismic resilience on campus. </summary><start-date>1578384000000</start-date><display-name>Seismic safety initiative</display-name><path>/2020/01/seismic-safety</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/01/seismic-safety</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1578351430377</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1578436655644</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Weekly Keynote</value><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Sarah Latham, Vice Chancellor, Business and Administrative Services</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/latham_sarah-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/latham_sarah-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>latham_sarah-400.jpg</name><display-name>latham_sarah-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>117100</file-size><width>400</width><height>271</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to share an update on the University of California's multi-year seismic safety initiative. The system&#8217;s goal is to have all buildings meet UC's rigorous seismic safety standards by the end of 2030.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, the UC Board of Regents approved significant revisions to the UC Seismic Policy, which included forming a new systemwide Seismic Advisory Board. Made up of leading experts, the board issued new guidelines for assessing all UC buildings based on the latest scientific understanding of earthquakes and changes in the California building code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The safety of our campus community is the highest priority for me and our campus leadership. This commitment is reflected in our continuous work to improve seismic safety on campus. In the past 12 years, our campus has spent more than $450 million to address our buildings' seismic needs. Recent projects include important improvements to the Student Union, Redwood Building, and Cardiff House. High-use buildings that have been seismically upgraded include Hahn Student Services, McHenry Library, the Cowell Dining Hall, the Cowell Student Health Center, and many more.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz has about 600 buildings, both big and small, across all its locations that need to be evaluated. Of these, about 200 have already met the UC guidelines and do not require further evaluation because they were built or upgraded after 1998. To date, we have reviewed 89 buildings, and prioritized them in descending order of risk in consultation with structural engineering firms engaged by the campus. Thirty-five meet current standards and 54 require a more detailed review, potentially requiring retrofits or replacement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are in the midst of reviewing approximately 300 additional buildings, which we believe pose the lowest risk to our campus community. Those evaluations will be completed in summer 2020, and we will provide another update at that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of you are aware that there will be a general obligation bond on the March ballot. If approved, the $2 billion earmarked for UC would contribute to helping the system address its seismic priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The buildings on the UC Santa Cruz campus most in need of seismic retrofit or replacement are Thimann Laboratories, the Jack Baskin Engineering Building, and Kerr Hall. We are actively working on plans to address these needs. More detailed reviews, which are currently underway, will help us determine what is best for each building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus community can view the completed seismic studies </span><a href="https://ppc.ucsc.edu/design/seismic-safety-initiative.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and read answers to </span><a href="https://ppc.ucsc.edu/design/seismic-safety-initiative-faq.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">frequently asked questions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>The public is invited to attend two events with legendary food activist Vandana Shiva, who will be at UC Santa Cruz on January 25 and 26.</p>
<p>Shiva, a proponent of "poison-free" food and a leader of the fight against Monsanto, will be in conversation with Anthropology Professor Nancy Chen on Saturday, January 25, at 7 p.m. in the UCSC Music Recital Hall. General admission is $10; free for students. Parking will be available in the Performing Arts parking lot for $5.</p>
<p>On Sunday, January 26, Shiva will participate in a day-long workshop that addresses the topic of "Poison-Free, Fossil-Free Food and Farming." She will be joined by Julie Guthman, professor of social sciences; Sarait Martinez, Safe Ag, Safe Schools; Zen Honeycutt, founding executive director of Moms Across America; and Mackenzie Feldman, founder of Herbicide-Free Campus. The workshop will be moderated by Tim Galarneau, community engaged education coordinator at the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), and facilitated by David Shaw, coordinator of the Right Livelihood College at UCSC. The workshop will run from 10 a.m.-4:15 p.m. in the Cowell Hay Barn on campus. Morning presentations will be followed by discussion; the afternoon will feature breakout sessions and whole-group dialogue. A detailed <a href="https://rightlivelihood.ucsc.edu/events/shiva.html">agenda</a> is available online. General admission is $60; early bird registration is $40 until January 10; admission for students is $10.</p>
<p>Advance registration, which is required for both events, is available <a href="https://rightlivelihood.ucsc.edu/events/shiva.html">online</a>.</p>
<p>Shiva is a well-known crusader for economic, food, and gender justice. In 2003, <em>Time </em>magazine named her an "environmental hero," and in 2010, <em>Forbes </em>magazine called her one of the seven most powerful women on the globe. She founded the Research Foundation for Science, Technology, and Ecology, and in 1991, she founded Navdanya, a movement to protect native seed, promote organic farming, and advocate for fair trade. In 2004, she started Bija Vidyapeeth (Earth University), an international college for sustainable living in Northern India.</p>
<p>In 1993, she received the Right Livelihood Award, also known as the "Alternative Nobel Prize." Her visit to UCSC is sponsored by the Right Livelihood College at UC Santa Cruz, with support from the Institute for Social Transformation; the Division of Social Sciences; the Food Systems Working Group; the Environmental Studies Department; the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems; and funds from the Heller Chair and Measure 43.</p>
<p>Shiva is in the United States to promote her campaign for <a href="https://navdanyainternational.org/cause/poison-free-food-and-farming-2030/">Poison-free Food and Farming</a> and to celebrate recent legal rulings against Bayer, which bought Roundup manufacturer Monsanto last year. A California jury recently found Bayer liable for Edwin Hardeman's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a ruling that is considered a bellwether for thousands of other lawsuits against Roundup.</p>
<p>Shaw, who is coordinating Shiva's visit to UCSC, hopes the Sunday workshop will attract a diverse array of stakeholders eager to explore how to build regional poison-free, fossil-free food and farming systems. "We hope to have policymakers, civil society organizations, and independent policy think tanks, farmers, and academics," he said.</p>
<p>The Right Livelihood College is also hosting a series of private meetings between Shiva and students, researchers, and faculty. "We want to develop long-term research collaborations, international field studies, internships, and future events," said Shaw.</p>

<p>Campus vehicles used about 72,000 gallons of diesel in 2019, fleet manager Theo Diamantopoulos said. He estimated the switch to renewable biodiesel&#8212;which is synthetically generated&#8212;reduced UCSC&#8217;s annual fleet CO2 emissions by 25 percent percent over the past year.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can tell the difference in clarity,&#8221; Diamantopoulos said. &#8220;It burns cleaner and you can even smell the difference if you&#8217;re near a bus.&#8221;</p>
<p>The move to 100 percent biodiesel in February 2019 reflects a campuswide commitment to reducing UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s impact on the environment and carefully stewarding the world&#8217;s natural resources.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz began considering moving to biodiesel after hearing that UC San Diego and UC Davis successfully moved to the renewable fuel. UC Santa Cruz switched to biodiesel in February and any vehicles that relied on regular diesel are now using biodiesel. On average, biodiesel costs the same or a bit less, he said.</p>
<p>The long-term goal is to move to an all-electric fleet of vehicles, Diamantopoulos said, though it will require a significant financial investment. Renewable diesel represents a way to do something tangible now, while the campus works toward even more sustainable options.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8635e19b8072701710975c5ab45b8158"><name>lick-campbell-fund</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>$1 million gift creates William Wallace Campbell Directorâ€™s Fund for Lick Observatory</title><summary>A new endowment honoring the third director of Lick Observatory will support current and future directorsâ€™ priorities for the observatory.</summary><keywords>Claire Max, William Wallace Campbell</keywords><start-date>1578470400000</start-date><display-name>$1 million gift creates William Wallace Campbell Directorâ€™s Fund for Lick Observatory</display-name><path>/2020/01/lick-campbell-fund</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/01/lick-campbell-fund</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1578504675709</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1578505274169</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/01/images/campbell-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/01/images/campbell-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>campbell-400.jpg</name><display-name>campbell-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>85676</file-size><width>400</width><height>578</height></image><image-alt>William Wallace Campbell</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/01/images/campbell-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/01/images/campbell-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>campbell-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>campbell-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>14348</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>William Wallace Campbell</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>William Wallace Campbell served as director of Lick Observatory from 1901 to 1930.

<p>The gift honors the memory of William Wallace Campbell, who served as the third director of Lick Observatory from 1901 to 1930, and was made by one of his granddaughters. Campbell also served as president of the University of California from 1923 to 1930, and as president of the National Academy of Sciences from 1931 to 1935.</p>
<p>Born on a farm in Hancock County, Ohio, in 1862, Campbell got interested in astronomy as an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, where he earned his B.S. in 1886. Lick Observatory began operations in 1888, and Campbell soon began spending his summers there. In 1891 he was invited to join its full-time staff.</p>
<p>A pioneer of astronomical spectroscopy, Campbell also spent decades measuring the radial velocities of stars to establish the spatial drift of the solar system. He led a 1922 Lick Observatory expedition to Australia to capture images during a solar eclipse that were used as final confirmation of Einstein&#8217;s general theory of relativity.</p>
<p>&#8220;William Wallace Campbell was an extraordinary man, and it&#8217;s a deep honor to receive this gift in his name. Lick Observatory would not be the vibrant scientific facility it is today without the ongoing donor support of our community,&#8221; said UCO Director Claire Max, the Bachmann Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The William Wallace Campbell Director&#8217;s Fund will be used to support the UCO Director&#8217;s priorities at Lick Observatory. The endowment continues Campbell&#8217;s legacy of leadership and represents a major step toward establishing the long-term financial sustainability of the observatory.</p>
<p>Lick Observatory is located on the summit of Mt. Hamilton in the Diablo Range east of San Jose. Founded in 1888, Lick Observatory is at the forefront of astronomical research as an active research facility. It is operated by the University of California Observatories (UCO), a multi-campus research unit that serves eight UC campuses and is headquartered at UC Santa Cruz.

by <em>ArtNews</em>.</p>
<p>The oldest and most widely circulated art magazine in the world, <em>ArtNews </em>has a readership that spans 124 countries and includes collectors, dealers, historians, artists, museum directors, curators, and connoisseurs.</p>
<p><em>Chicano and Chicana Art: A Critical Anthology </em>presents an overview of the history and theory of Chicano and Chicana art from the 1960s to the mid-2000s.</p>
<p>Designed to be an introductory teaching collection, the book is comprised of thematically organized essays by leading scholars, tracing the development of Chicano/a art from its early role in the Chicano civil rights movement to its mainstream acceptance in American art institutions.</p>
<p>Gonz&#225;lez served as chief editor for the 552-page book, which was published in February 2019 by Duke University Press, in collaboration with co-editors Ondine Chavoya, Chon Noriega and Tere Romo.</p>
<p>The <em>ArtNews</em> survey of the best art books published from 2010 to 2019 noted: &#8220;One of many efforts in recent years to create a fuller picture of art history, this anthology is the first of its kind: a collection devoted to a range of Chicanx artists--from Amalia Mesa-Bains to Carlos Almaraz--who have long been kept out of displays at American museums and are now slowly making their way into the spotlight. Though focused on particular identities, the book broaches larger questions that have pervaded debates about representation overall.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Gonz&#225;lez noted in the book&#8217;s introduction:<br/> <br/> &#8220;We hope this anthology will draw the interest of students of Chicana/o history and culture, as well as art theorists and visual studies scholars who practice in a field that has, until relatively recently, generally ignored the contribution of Chicana/o art to American and contemporary art history. <br/> <br/> &#8220;What does the future hold for globally mobile citizens, refugees, Indigenous populations, and noncitizens? Are the terms &#8216;Chicano&#8217; and &#8216;Chicana&#8217; irretrievably historical and dated, or will they be taken up again, in a new way? How will marginalized populations respond creatively to ongoing, systematic economic and racial injustice? These are important concerns of our present time; they have changed little in the past fifty years since the Chicano movement was launched. Developing a response to these questions nevertheless remains one of the goals toward which Chicana/o art is directed, and to which this collection hopes to contribute.&#8221;</p>

Vaccines offer protection from this threat, but getting the flu vaccine every year can be a hassle, and many adults go without it. In fact, the CDC estimates that only about 37% of the adult population received the flu vaccine in 2018, a decline from previous years.</p>
<p>But what if people only needed to be vaccinated once to receive many years of protection? This type of &#8220;universal vaccine&#8221; is what Rebecca DuBois, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering, calls the &#8220;holy grail for influenza,&#8221; and it may be closer than you think.</p>
<p>DuBois is part of the Center for Influenza Virus Research for High Risk Populations (CIVR-HRP), a research group led by the University of Georgia that is working to develop a universal flu vaccine. The center is part of the new <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-forms-new-collaborative-influenza-vaccine-research-network">Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centers (CIVICs)</a> program funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The University of Georgia has received an initial award that could total as much as $130 million if all contract options are exercised. DuBois&#8217; role on the project, funded by an initial $1.5 million sub-award, will use structural biology to visualize the vaccine candidates that are being designed by her collaborators in the group.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something that wouldn&#8217;t have been possible in the past,&#8221; DuBois says.</p>
<p>She explains that this is because the previous method of creating vaccines required using strains of the virus that existed in nature and were always evolving. However, with the recent development of vaccines that are made in lab cultures rather than with the viruses themselves, researchers believe that it is now possible to build a &#8220;rational&#8221; vaccine. DuBois defines a rational vaccine as one that is engineered based on an understanding of how vaccines work on a molecular and immunological level, as opposed to one that simply uses inactivated or weakened strains of an existing virus.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always had to use whatever strains already existed out there in the world and generate vaccines against them, but now we can engineer chimeric vaccine antigens that contain mixed and matched parts from different virus strains,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Getting the flu is inconvenient for many of us, but for some populations it can be dangerous and even deadly. DuBois hopes the work she is doing will help protect these more vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elderly people, obese people, pregnant women, children, and people with health problems resulting in immunodeficiency have the highest risk of developing severe influenza disease, so making a vaccine that provides improved protection for a longer period of time would be great,&#8221; she says. &#8220;What I really like about working with the CIVR-HRP research group is that their focus is on subgroups of people who are more susceptible to influenza, and that we will be developing models to test flu vaccines in different ways to make sure they work for all kinds of people.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Protecting children against disease</strong></p>
<p>Since she arrived at Baskin Engineering six years ago, DuBois' focus has been to understand how the immune system responds to virus infections and use that information to develop next-generation vaccines, particularly for illnesses that impact children. Developing a new flu vaccine is one of three major NIH-funded projects that DuBois has going on in her lab this year, all of which have something to do with vaccine development.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main theme in my lab is childhood viruses that we don&#8217;t have vaccines for yet,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I have two kids, and I see how often they still get sick, especially in the first couple of years. Even though we already have an impressive vaccine schedule that protects them from so many things, we still need more vaccines.&#8221;</p>
<p>DuBois came to the UC Santa Cruz with a Career Award that funded her study of human astrovirus, a stomach bug that primarily affects children and for which there are no current treatments. In February 2019, she received a 5-year, $1.7 million NIH grant to continue researching the structure of the virus, which she hopes will lead to the development of a new vaccine.</p>
<p>&#8220;We as adults don&#8217;t get astrovirus infection because we have had it in the past, so we are immune,&#8221; she explains. &#8220;That tells me that we can develop a vaccine if we understand how the immune system is responding.&#8221;</p>
<p>DuBois says she is thrilled to have this new funding, which is a validation of the hard work she has been doing on the astrovirus vaccine for the last six years. &#8220;I started my lab on this project, so it&#8217;s really research that has been ongoing for my entire time here,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I am really excited.&#8221;</p>
<p>DuBois also recently received a one-year grant to study respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a nasty virus that infects the respiratory tract and is especially bad for babies. According to the CDC, an estimated 57,000 children younger than 5 years old are hospitalized due to RSV infection in the United States each year. DuBois&#8217; goal is to create vaccine antigens that will be able to train our immune systems to fight against the virus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our approach is similar to that in the other grants, in that we are going to be designing new vaccine antigens in a way we couldn&#8217;t engineer with the traditional way of making vaccines,&#8221; she explains.</p>
<p>The universal flu vaccine project is funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a component of the NIH, Department of Health and Human Services, under contract 75N93019C00052.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8c4b624280727017465cacce78550310"><name>its-update-from-vc-williams</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>ITS Update from VC Williams</title><summary>Happy 2020!

<p dir="ltr"><span>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), also known as &#8220;two-step&#8221; or &#8220;2-factor&#8221; authentication, was a huge undertaking and is now mandatory for all faculty, staff, and students when accessing Gold password systems. The project involved everyone on campus and was completed on-time and below budget with minimal disruption to business. Thanks to multi-factor, the campus systems that make use of the Gold password are much safer than before.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>As part of the continued UC systemwide effort to provide increased security against cybercrime, the UCSC Google Suite of services (campus email, calendar, drive, groups, etc.) switched from Blue to Gold password on Aug. 26, 2019. As a result, multi-factor authentication is now part of the Google login process. Adoption of the Google Suite of services, also known as Google Apps, continues to be active since its rollout in 2011, and new functionalities are continually being added by Google to enhance your experience.&#160;</span></p>

As of Nov. 14, 2019,&#160; the completed deployment restored over 85,000 UCSC Google accounts for some prior students and alumni. The expansion of UCSC Google Apps services improves our campus&#8217;s ability to engage with prior students regardless of their graduation status, streamlines our communication and outreach efforts to alumni and those wishing to return to UCSC, and offers an enhanced user experience by simplifying access to these frequently-requested services.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Susan Howells, Director of Strategic Engagement in University Relations, describes the impact of Slug G Suite for UCSC:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Alumni are grateful to have their @UCSC email addresses for life. We've received comments of surprise, delight, and some sentimental reflections as they look back over emails from their student years. For our work in Alumni Engagement and University Relations, email for life vastly improves our ability to maintain our relationships with our largest constituency. I expect we will feel the benefits of this program in expanded connection to, and support for, the university.&#160;</em></p>

ITS collaborated with many campus business partners to ensure a smooth transition. Leading up to the UCPath go live, ITS spent the last few months transitioning from the UCPath testing systems to the production setup. The first production data "burst" from Office of the President was on Dec. 9, the first in ongoing regular daily burst of data from OP. The cutover involved many ITS groups, from programmers to infrastructure, networking and on-prem system builds to extensive modifications for CruzPay, HR systems and Financial systems.</span></p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><span>Where We&#8217;re Heading</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in ITS</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I am leading an effort to reignite the ITS Division&#8217;s efforts to advance Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Building on a strong foundation in this area and a history of solid progress, ITS is redoubling its efforts to improve our recruitment processes, increase opportunities to raise divisional awareness, and ensure that the operational support that ITS provides to the entire campus has a positive impact on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (including the support provided to individuals with disabilities). ITS has recently reinstated an advisory group of ITS staff called the Diversity Interest Group in IT (DIG-IT). The group will advise the VCIT on how to support building a diverse and inclusive culture, measure and monitor divisional climate, and tell the story of our efforts. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is a top priority for our division, and we would like to work with other campus groups to confront the ongoing challenges before us.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>IT Governance</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Effective IT Governance is key to moving the campus forward on its strategic objectives. In the past, the process to prioritize and the decision to fund projects and initiatives were conjoined. A new IT Governance model for the campus will split out the effort to prioritize from the decision to fund. For the first time, the campus will have specific definitions on which groups can influence these governance decisions and which groups have the ultimate responsibility to make the final decisions. The process itself and the decisions emanating from the new IT Governance model will be made transparent to the campus. Expect more information on this topic in spring 2020.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Becoming Agile</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>ITS is dedicated to elevating the importance of the user experience through a strong customer focus. By incorporating lean thinking and agile processes into our daily work, ITS staff can focus on the things that matter most to you and move through work more quickly.

Founded on transparency, inspection and adaptation, Agile practices help people visualize the work before them and require teams to communicate daily to prioritize the work at hand. To date, just about all ITS staff have attended Agile training, and staff from other divisions on campus have attended as well.&#160;</span></p>

The vandalism has occurred primarily on Science Hill, and at Cowell and Stevenson colleges.<br/><br/>The vandalism includes intentional interruption of electrical power, causing street lights not to work; tampering and damaging natural-gas valves, causing gas leaks; and pouring materials into bathroom drains, causing serious plumbing problems. These are dangerous acts that increase the risk to the health and safety of our campus community.<br/><br/>Anyone who has information regarding these incidents is asked to call the campus dispatch center at 831-459-2231, Ext. 1. All suspicious activities should be reported as soon as possible to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department. Timely reporting allows the department to keep the campus safe and to help locate those responsible.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Safety tips</strong></div>
<div><br/> &#8226; Be alert to your surroundings and trust your instincts. If something or someone makes you feel uneasy, or if someone is in an area where it would appear they should not be, alert authorities, avoid the person, and leave the area.&#8232;<br/> &#8226; If you feel you or others are in danger, immediately call 911.&#8232;<br/> &#8226; If you smell natural gas, also call 911 as soon as possible.&#8232;<br/> &#8226; If you see something, say something. Your actions can help prevent others from becoming victims.&#8232;</div></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Nader Oweis, Chief of Police</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8ccd69ed80727017465caccea6f9a132"><name>faber-gold-medal</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomer Sandra Faber awarded Royal Astronomical Societyâ€™s Gold Medal</title><summary>The Royal Astronomical Society has awarded its Gold Medal in Astronomy to Sandra Faber, professor emerita of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. </summary><start-date>1578672000000</start-date><display-name>Astronomer Sandra Faber awarded Royal Astronomical Societyâ€™s Gold Medal</display-name><path>/2020/01/faber-gold-medal</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/01/faber-gold-medal</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1578615269844</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1578934759321</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/01/images/sandra-faber-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/01/images/sandra-faber-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sandra-faber-350.jpg</name><display-name>sandra-faber-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>110265</file-size><width>350</width><height>525</height></image><image-alt>Sandra Faber</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/01/images/sandra-faber-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/01/images/sandra-faber-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sandra-faber-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>sandra-faber-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23503</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Sandra Faber</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Sandra Faber (photo by Steve Kurtz)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Royal Astronomical Society has awarded its Gold Medal in Astronomy to Sandra Faber, professor emerita of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The award recognizes Faber &#8220;for her outstanding research on the formation, structure and evolution of galaxies, and for her contributions to the optical design of the Keck Telescopes and other novel astronomical instruments.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Gold Medal is the Royal Astronomical Society&#8217;s highest award, often given in recognition of a lifetime&#8217;s work. Previous recipients include Albert Einstein, Edwin Hubble, Steven Hawking, Vera Rubin, and Donald Osterbrock, a UCSC astronomer who received the award in 1997.</p>
<p>Faber is one of the leaders world-wide in the study of galaxies, with an enduring legacy of contributions across a wide range of topics in galaxy structure, galaxy evolution, and cosmology.</p>
<p>In 1976 she discovered, with Robert Jackson, a relation (known as the Faber-Jackson relation) between the central velocity dispersion of stars in elliptical galaxies and the mass of the galaxy. In 1979 she wrote an influential review article with John S. Gallagher that is widely regarded as a turning point in the debate about the importance of dark matter in the universe.</p>
<p>Faber was an early pioneer (together with George Blumenthal and Joel Primack at UCSC and Martin Rees at Cambridge) in developing a model of galaxy formation based on cold dark matter, which now underpins our current understanding of galaxy and cluster formation.</p>
<p>She has played important roles in a remarkable number of collaborative programs that have led to further breakthroughs, including the discovery of a mass concentration responsible for large-scale flows in the nearby universe (the &#8216;Great Attractor&#8217;). With Douglas Richstone, she led the team that used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to identify a correlation between black hole mass and the velocity dispersion of stars in the host galaxy bulge.</p>
<p>Faber contributed to the optical design of the Keck Telescopes and led the construction of the multi-object DEIMOS spectrograph for the Keck. She and Jon Holtzman played a major role in diagnosing Hubble's optical flaw and executing the subsequent repair. With Henry Ferguson, she led the CANDELS deep imaging survey of distant galaxies with HST, the largest project in the history of the mission.</p>
<p>Faber joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 1972 and in 1995 was made University Professor, the highest honor for faculty in the UC system. She received the National Medal of Science in 2013, the Gruber Cosmology Prize in 2017, and the American Philosophical Society's Magellanic Premium Medal in 2019, among many other awards and honors in recognition of her accomplishments.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb

Center for Creative Ecologies at UC Santa Cruz will launch the <em>Beyond the End of the World</em><em>&#160;</em>lecture series with award-winning author <strong>Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor,</strong> on January 23, at the Music Center Recital Hall.</p>
<p>Taylor writes and speaks about Black politics, social movements, and racial inequality in the United States. She is the author of&#160;<em>From #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation</em>, winner of the 2016 Lannan Cultural Freedom Award for an Especially Notable Book, which honors nonfiction works of particular relevance to the current historical moment.</p>
<p>Harvard professor and social critic Cornel West has described the book as &#8220;brilliant&#8230;the best analysis we have of the #BlackLivesMatter moment of the long struggle for freedom in America,&#8221; adding that &#8220;Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor has emerged as the most sophisticated and courageous radical intellectual of her generation.&#8221;</p>
<p>And <em>The Guardian</em> noted: &#8220;Taylor, a professor of African American studies at Princeton, is the rare academic writer whose sense of humor is as sharp as her scholarship.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <em>Beyond the End of the World</em> lecture series is part of a year-long research and exhibition project led by UCSC arts professor T. J. Demos, director of the Center for Creative Ecologies. The goal is to bring leading international thinkers and cultural practitioners to UC Santa Cruz to discuss what lies beyond dystopian catastrophism, and how we can cultivate radical futures of justice, equality, and a healthy environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I'm really excited that Keeanga is our inaugural speaker,&#8221; said Demos. &#8220;It's because she speaks so forcefully about a politics of liberation that transcends social and identitarian difference. She draws on and embraces a radical conception of intersectionality in her work. It not only addresses current socio-political concerns--for example, the pathologies of Trumpism--with all sorts of critical insights, but also provides vital resources and exactly what we'll need to survive the divisive dystopian present of ethno-nationalisms, grotesque capitalist inequality, and the resurgence of white supremacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor was named one of the 100 most influential African Americans in the United States in 2016 by the<span>&#160;</span><em>The Root</em>. Her writing has been featured in a wide variety of publications, including the&#160;<em>New York Times, The Guardian, Los Angeles Times, Boston Review, The Paris Review, The New Republic, Al Jazeera America, Jacobin, In These Times, New Politics, and Souls: A Critical Journal of Black Politics, Culture and Society.</em></p>
<p><em></em>She is also the editor of&#160;<em>How We Get Free: Black Feminism and the Combahee River Collective</em>, which received the 2018 Lambda Literary Award for LGBTQ Nonfiction.</p>
<p>Taylor&#8217;s latest book, <em>Race For Profit: How Banks and the Real Estate Industry Undermined Black Homeownership</em>, has additionally been longlisted for the 2019 National Book Award.</p>
<p>Other speakers in the series will include <a href="https://beyond.ucsc.edu/2019/09/06/keynotes/"><strong>Amitav Ghosh</strong></a><a href="https://beyond.ucsc.edu/keynote-speakers/amitav-ghosh/">,</a>&#160;an award-winning fiction writer and author of&#160;<em>The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable</em>;&#160;<a href="https://beyond.ucsc.edu/2019/09/06/keynotes/"><strong>N</strong><strong>ick Estes</strong></a><strong>&#160;</strong>(Lower Brule Sioux), co-founder of Red Nation and author of&#160;<em>Our History Is the Future: Standing Rock Versus the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Long Tradition of Indigenous Resistance</em>;&#160;<a href="https://beyond.ucsc.edu/2019/09/06/keynotes/"><strong>Mel</strong><strong>a</strong></a><strong><a href="https://beyond.ucsc.edu/2019/09/06/keynotes/">nie Yazzie</a>&#160;</strong>(Bilag&#225;ana/Din&#233;), Red Nation member and co-editor of&#160;<em>Decolonization: Indigeneity, Education and Society</em>; and artist/activists&#160;<a href="https://beyond.ucsc.edu/2019/09/06/keynotes/"><strong>Amin Husain and Nitasha Dhillon of MTL/Decolonize This Place</strong></a><a href="https://beyond.ucsc.edu/keynote-speakers/amin-husain-and-nitasha-dhillon-of-mtl-decolonize-this-place/">,</a>&#160;an action-oriented movement centering on Indigenous struggle, Black liberation, global wage workers, and de-gentrification.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Racial reconciliation and the future of race in America will be the subject of a public conversation with scholars Alondra Nelson and Herman Gray on Wednesday, January 22, at the Kuumbwa Jazz Center.</p>
<p>The public is invited to attend the event, which begins at 7 p.m. (doors open at 6 p.m.). Tickets are available <a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=3860&amp;cid=7776">online</a>; admission is $10 for the general public and free for students.</p>
<p>The event will feature a conversation with Nelson and Gray, moderated by Jenny Reardon, professor of sociology at UC Santa Cruz. Nelson is the president of the Social Science Research Council and an acclaimed author whose research focuses on questions of science, technology, and social inequality. Her books include,&#160;<em>Body and Soul: The Black Panther Party and the Fight Against Medical Discrimination&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>The Social Life of DNA: Race, Reparations, and Reconciliation after the Genome</em>. Nelson is the&#160;<span>Harold F. Linder Professor in the School of&#160;Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.&#160;</span>Gray is a professor emeritus of sociology at UCSC who has written extensively about black cultural theory, politics, and media.</p>
<p>"Alondra is critically addressing some of the most troubling and urgent questions of our time," said Gray. "She brings rich insights, a critical perspective, and a wealth of information to the table.&#160;It's an honor to be in conversation with her."</p>
<p>Reardon, a professor of sociology and the director of the Science &amp; Justice Research Center at UCSC, has written two books about genomics and has been a vocal participant in conversations at the intersection of race, science, and politics.</p>
<p>"These are challenging times, with racist incidents and hate crimes on the rise across the country," said Katharyne Mitchell, dean of the Division of Social Sciences at UCSC. "I look forward to hearing these three great scholars share their insights and help us make sense of the current moment&#8212;and help us think collectively about how to shape a more racially just future."</p>

The course, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teaching as an Ethical Practice: A Guide for Teaching Assistants</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was created at the request of the </span><a href="https://graddiv.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Division of Graduate Studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the</span><a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CITL) and</span><a href="https://online.ucsc.edu/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a partnership that allows for new graduate students to have a more robust, thorough introduction to teaching at UC Santa Cruz than ever before.</span>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teaching as an Ethical Practice</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was modeled on a long-standing online course at UC Berkeley designed for graduate students entering university classrooms for the first time as teachers. Adapted specifically for UC Santa Cruz, the course features the voices of 19 campus community members, appearing in over 25 videos, who leveraged their campus experiences and expertise to communicate with TAs about the importance of creating classroom environments conducive to learning and the resources available to them and to their students that provide holistic support. These videos, which are interspersed with content informed by educational research, case scenarios, personal reflection questions, and quizzes, make the course an interactive experience for first-time TAs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflecting on her role developing the course with CITL, Sheeva Sabati described how issues of educational equity played a key role in shaping the course content. &#8220;One of the central goals in designing this course was to support graduate students to begin to consider how questions of educational equity and student learning are at the core of the ethical dimensions of their teaching practice,&#8221; said Sabati, who is currently a lecturer at Oakes College, Colleges 9 and 10, and the Feminist Studies Department, and was a graduate student researcher with CITL last year. &#8220;We not only wanted to equip new TAs with evidence-based pedagogical strategies, but we also wanted to demonstrate how supporting equity requires actively working against re-entrenching historically and structurally produced forms of exclusion that are often normalized within higher education.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To this end, the course asks new TAs to consider complex questions and scenarios that take time, consideration, and reflection to address. Examples include considering how instructors&#8217; and students&#8217; identities, experiences, and backgrounds shape interactions in the classroom, and how TAs can plan in advance to help make classrooms more accessible spaces for learning, where everyone has the opportunity to participate. To provide concrete examples, several videos feature current and experienced graduate student instructors discussing how they practice self-reflection in their classrooms and plan activities that increase student participation.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One graduate student contributor, Mecaila Smith, Ph.D. candidate in education, explained how she hopes this resource will improve the experiences of new TAs and their students. &#8220;Being a TA puts you in a position of power over undergraduates, so it is important for graduate students to be reflective about the kind of impact they want to have on students&#8217; educational experiences,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;Being a TA can also be intimidating. It involves a lot of responsibilities that many new grad students haven&#8217;t had before&#8212;being in a leadership role, public speaking, creating lesson plans for sections, facilitating activities, mediating discussions, assessing the work of others, and more. Being well prepared to serve as a TA is a way for graduate students to value their work, advocate for themselves, and become proud of and confident in their teaching.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to hearing from experienced graduate students, new TAs also have the opportunity to learn from the Director of CITL, the directors of the six</span><a href="https://resourcecenters.ucsc.edu/index.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Resource Centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="https://diversity.ucsc.edu/about/cdo-ss.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Diversity Officer for Staff and Students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the director of the </span><a href="https://drc.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disability Resource Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who all discuss inclusive teaching practices that support students who face marginalization on campus due to histories of exclusion in higher education. Likewise, since TAs are often the first people to whom students turn when they need additional support to succeed in their classes, several videos feature leadership from </span><a href="https://titleix.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Title IX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://care.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Advocacy Resources &amp; Education (CARE)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://caps.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> discussing how to support student mental health and safety. Finally, to support TAs to understand their rights as student employees, a representative from the </span><a href="https://uaw2865.org/about-our-union/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TA union, UAW 2865</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, discusses important information from the current union contract.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas a general introduction to being a teaching assistant has historically been offered as a 4-hour, in-person event embedded within a busy graduate student orientation schedule at the start of the academic year, the new course allows for new TAs to learn about these important issues at a more manageable pace. The Division of Graduate Studies has invited new graduate students to take the course as part of their first TAship on campus, or as part of a discipline-specific pedagogy course offered within many academic departments. Both options provide TAs more time to reflect on and put into practice what they learn, while adhering to the labor union guidelines for TA professional development training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Graduate Division has considered how to best make TA support and training more consistent across campus for over a decade,&#8221; said James Moore, assistant dean of the Division of Graduate Studies. &#8220;Current online learning design and strategies allowed us to re-envision the initial TA orientation as an interactive resource that both new and experienced TAs can actively engage, and as a tool that can better prepare TAs at the outset to be effective teachers. We feel the online course can better prepare graduate students to teach while at UC Santa Cruz, and serve as a solid foundation for further professional development as they prepare for their post-graduation careers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You always need a compelling reason for moving a course or a training to an online format,&#8221; added Michael Tassio, director of online education, and Aaron Zachmeier, assistant director for instructional design and development. &#8220;Moving the TA ethics training online was a good idea for a lot of reasons. It&#8217;s now available at any time, and it covers more material in greater depth. It can also be used in conjunction with training provided by departments and divisions. This project fit really well with Online Education&#8217;s mission to partner with organizations and instructors to create rigorous, creative, and transformative online courses that reflect our campus&#8217; longstanding commitment to teaching.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the online course promises to reach 200-350 new TAs per academic year, graduate students will be able to continue to access the content throughout their time at UC Santa Cruz, providing a rich reference guide during as many as 18 academic quarters of teaching on campus. In addition to complementing pedagogical training provided by academic departments and divisions, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teaching as an Ethical Practice </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">now serves as a foundational entry point into a series of several professional development opportunities that have been created over the past few years to enhance graduate student education at UC Santa Cruz. These opportunities include the CITL&#8217;s </span><a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/programs/graduate-certificate-programs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">teaching-focused Graduate Certificate Programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/programs/graduate-pedagogy-fellows/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graduate Pedagogy Fellows program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the Division of Graduate Studies&#8217; </span><a href="https://graddiv.ucsc.edu/current-students/grad-student-resources/grad-student-leadership-prog.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graduate Student Leadership Certificate Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://graddiv.ucsc.edu/grad-horizons/communication.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional Communication Certificate Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz faculty, staff, and continuing graduate students who would like to access the online course can email Sonya Newlyn (snewlyn@ucsc.edu), Professional Development Coordinator in the Division of Graduate Studies.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Local streets of the world&#8217;s cities are becoming less connected, part of a global trend that is driving urban sprawl and discouraging the use of public transportation.</p>
<p>The trend was revealed in a new <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/01/13/1905232116">study</a>&#160;by researchers at UC Santa Cruz and McGill University. Published in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, </em>the study is the first global examination of sprawl as measured by the local connectivity of street networks. The research relied on publicly available data sourced from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=2/71.3/-96.8">OpenStreetMap</a>, the Wikipedia of maps, and satellite-derived data.</p>
<p>"Sprawl is an environmental problem, because it makes it difficult for people to walk and to access public transit, which forces them to stay in their cars," said coauthor Adam Millard-Ball, an associate professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz. "It's also a public health problem, because walking to the bus, work, or shops is one of the best forms of exercise."</p>
<p>The study identified a growing number of gated communities, which revealed a third&#8212;social&#8212;aspect of the problem: Gated communities divide people in ways that reinforce social divisions, often along class lines, said Millard-Ball.</p>
<p>The study is the first of its kind to examine global sprawl. The researchers used OpenStreetMap to look at the connectivity of 46 million kilometers of urban streets, then deployed an algorithm to calculate the connectivity of cities and regions around the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to take a systematic approach that identifies cities&#8212;which might not be household names beyond their country&#8217;s borders&#8212;where sprawl is rapidly worsening,&#8221; said coauthor Christopher Barrington-Leigh, an associate professor at McGill&#8217;s Institute for Health and Social Policy. &#8220;We also wanted to identify the cities that, often with little fanfare, have been working to grow in an efficient, connected pattern for decades.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The best and the worst</strong></p>
<p>Places such as Mexico City and Los Angeles have gotten a "bad rap," said Millard-Ball, adding that "There wasn't much evidence they were actually the worst. In our work, we found that places such as Bangkok and Guatemala City have sprawled even more in recent years."</p>
<p>The researchers also identified areas that are bucking the trend toward sprawl, including cities like Buenos Aires and Tokyo that have maintained very low levels of sprawl. "Buenos Aires benefits from the influence of the Spanish-style gridded-street pattern, while Tokyo is one of the most walkable cities in the world, with an irregular street pattern but still very low rates of car travel," he said.</p>
<p>The result of a 7-year collaboration, the study was able to show that in large parts of the world, recent urban growth has increasingly resulted in inflexible and disconnected street networks. Different forms of gated communities were found to be on the rise globally. Past research has shown that the increased accessibility offered by gridded street networks makes walking, cycling, and the use of public transit much simpler, while cul-de-sacs tend to encourage the use of personal motorized vehicles.</p>
<p>Millard-Ball and Barrington-Leigh built a <a href="https://sprawlmap.org/?">Street-Network Disconnectedness Index</a> to create a global street-connectivity map. Their data showed that Southeast Asia is now home to some of the most sprawling cities on the planet.</p>
<p>By contrast, gridded street networks in Bolivia, Argentina, and Peru promote efficient, dense urban living. Germany, Denmark, and the United Kingdom have been able to maintain moderate levels of street connectivity thanks to pedestrian and bicycle pathways, offering greater connectivity to non-motorized travel.</p>
<p>"A connected street network makes public transit possible," said Millard-Ball. "Building a public train system in Orange County would be ineffective, because there's not a critical mass of people living within walking distance of stations."</p>
<p><strong>Sprawl declines in the U.S.</strong></p>
<p>The United States is one of the few spots where sprawl has gone down in recent years, said Millard-Ball, adding that "It was incredibly high to start with, so there was really only one way for it to go. Still, the trend is encouraging."</p>
<p>He attributes the decline to policy measures, including cities like Charlotte, North Carolina, and states like Virginia that now require new developments to build more connected streets.</p>
<p>Other countries have taken far-reaching steps at the national level, noted Millard-Ball. "Government policies in the United Kingdom after 2000 said streets had to be permeable&#8212;allowing flow of foot and bicycle traffic," he said. "China has recently made a national policy shift from giant super blocks to a fine-grained, connected pattern of streets."</p>
<p>In conjunction with the study&#8217;s publication, the authors are launching an <a href="https://sprawlmap.org/?"><span>online interactive map</span><span></span></a><a href="https://map.sprawl.research.mcgill.ca/"><span></span></a> through which visitors can explore street connectivity around the world. Previous studies of sprawl have tended to focus on individual cities, or case studies of cities within one country.</p>
<p>Barrington-Leigh said urban planners need to think about connectivity at the most local scale when designing and planning new streets in order to make cities more sustainable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Streets and roads represent an essentially permanent backbone that shapes all other dimensions of urban form and land use,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Policy makers should look to cities like Tokyo and Buenos Aires for inspiration on how to limit sprawl. On our current path, choices that limit street connectivity may restrict future resilience and lock in pathways of energy use, CO2 emissions, health outcomes, and other aspects of our lifestyle for a century or more.&#8221;</p>
<p>The methodology used to build the connectivity index and maps is described in a <a href="../journals.plos.org/plosone/article%253Fid=10.1371/journal.pone.0223078">paper</a> previously published in the <em>Public Library of Science</em>.</p>

He was 100.<br/><br/>Baskin was an active supporter of engineering and other programs at UC Santa Cruz over several decades, providing advice to faculty and campus leaders as well as generous financial support. His cornerstone gift helped launch UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering in 1997. Baskin and his family have also supported many other programs at UCSC, including the Elena Baskin Visual Arts Center, the Institute of Marine Sciences, arts programs, endowed chairs, and scholarships. The donations from Baskin and his foundation have amounted to more than $10 million.<br/><br/>"Jack Baskin's impact at UC Santa Cruz can be seen across the campus, from engineering to the arts and humanities," said UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive. "His philanthropy has been strategic, multifaceted, and transformational to our campus, and his support included extensive contributions of his time and energy."<br/><br/>Baskin's involvement with UC Santa Cruz began in the 1970s, when founding chancellor Dean McHenry invited him to serve on the campus's physical planning committee. He was a trustee of the UCSC Foundation for over 30 years, including two years as chair.<br/><br/>"From the very early years of UC Santa Cruz, Jack Baskin campaigned for a strong engineering presence on campus," said Alexander Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. "He wanted UCSC to be a leader in engineering, a vision that has been realized, in part through his generosity, with world-class research and education."<br/><br/>Baskin also gave generously to assist families, children, and senior citizens in the Santa Cruz region through the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz County, which he helped establish, and other organizations. Beneficiaries of his time and donations include Dominican Hospital, Cabrillo College, and Monterey Peninsula College. Baskin was named "Man of the Year" by the Santa Cruz County Chamber of Commerce in 1986.&#160;In 2008, he and his wife Peggy Downes Baskin established the Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation to provide financial support for gender equality and increased access to education for marginalized communities in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties.<br/><br/>Born in upstate New York, Baskin was the first in his family to attend college. His parents, who spoke no English when they immigrated to the United States from Russia in 1908, insisted that he study engineering. Baskin studied mechanical engineering at the University of Colorado and earned a B.S. in aeronautical engineering from New York University in 1940. He was a pilot and served as an aeronautics instructor during World War II.<br/><br/>Baskin moved to Southern California in the late 1940s, where he worked as a general contractor and built a very successful development company. His company worked on commercial, industrial, and public construction projects throughout California. After moving to Palo Alto in 1967, he saw a need for quality affordable housing in the region. His company built the first low-income housing center in San Francisco and thousands of apartments for low-income families and the elderly in the San Francisco and Monterey Bay areas.<br/><br/>In 2006, Baskin was inducted into the Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame in recognition of his role in establishing the Baskin School of Engineering. He received the inaugural Fiat Lux Award from UC Santa Cruz in 2005 in honor of his service to the campus. UC Santa Cruz celebrated Baskin's 100th birthday with an event at the engineering school on September 19 featuring family members, as well as faculty and alumni who spoke about Baskin's influence on their lives and careers.<br/><br/>Baskin's first marriage, to Virginia Ruth Goldman, ended in divorce. His second wife, Elena, died in 1995. He is survived by his wife Peggy Downes Baskin, daughters Marianna Baskin Gabriel Mejia and Elaine Baskin,&#160;stepsons Nicholas Baran and Scott Dewar, stepdaughter Cammy Torgenrud, and their spouses and children, as well as an extended family of loved ones.</p>

Baskin, whose generous gift helped launch our Jack Baskin School of Engineering, died at his home in Carmel on Jan. 12, 2020. He turned 100 in September, and campus marked the occasion with a special celebration.</p>
<p>While Jack Baskin's name will forever be associated with our school of engineering, his impact can be seen in every corner of campus, both through his philanthropy and leadership. Between gifts made along with his late wife Elena Baskin, and gifts given through the Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation that he created with his wife of 24 years, Jack Baskin touched every academic division with his generosity.</p>
<p>He gave more than money. His involvement with UC Santa Cruz spanned nearly 50 years, starting in the 1970s when our first chancellor asked him to serve on a planning committee. He would end up serving as a UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee for more than 30 years including two stints as chair. He was also generous with his advice to faculty and campus leaders.</p>
<p>We were fortunate that Jack Baskin understood what makes UC Santa Cruz unique, and for his deep support of our campus. Our campus is forever grateful to both Jack and Peggy Baskin for their transformative generosity.

Her role as a research assistant includes plenty of transcribing. She also builds code books&#8212;documents outlining how interview responses can be analyzed as data&#8212;to systematically make sense of students&#8217; experiences.<br/><br/>Under the mentorship of graduate students, Garay-Solis (Carson &#8216;20, psychology) works alongside fellow student researchers to study factors of student success for first-generation (the first in their family to graduate from a four-year college or university) and underrepresented minority college students. <br/><br/>As a first-gen student herself, the work is especially meaningful to Garay-Solis. <br/><br/>She uses statistical techniques that she learned in coursework and in the Collab to help see patterns in the interview responses. <br/><br/>&#8220;We learn how to run the data for our research group, present them with what we find,&#8221; Garay-Solis says. &#8220;Then we learn how to describe it so people on campus can know what we&#8217;re talking about.&#8221;<br/><br/>Under the supervision of Rebecca Covarrubias, associate professor of psychology, Collab researchers study student experiences. First-generation and underrepresented minority students graduate at rates below their peers. Collab researchers interview them to find the structural barriers that get in the way and to assess which practices effectively respond.<br/><br/>One common barrier is the need to work, often at multiple jobs; a response: offering paid opportunities. <br/><br/>Covarrubias&#8217;s work has led to workshops for faculty, and the research taking place in the Collab will feed a support structure that all students will eventually receive.<br/>
<h3>Building solutions</h3>
<p>For Covarrubias, who was also a first-generation college student, participation in research as an undergraduate was formative. Her route to becoming involved offers another example of a barrier and effective response: Like many first-generation students, she worked to support her studies, which left little time to pursue research. Then she was selected as a Ronald E. McNair Achievement Scholar, which freed her from needing to work during her remaining school years and made it possible for her to engage in research. <br/><br/>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have seen research as a possible direction without the support system of McNair,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I&#8217;m research faculty because of the McNair staff, faculty mentor, and the scholar cohort.&#8221;<br/><br/>Garay-Solis had read Covarrubias&#8217;s work in high school. Then, the summer before her third year at UCSC, she was teaching a psychology class to high school students in her Marin County hometown. She had the students respond to Covarrubias's research on college student mental well-being and the guilt some first-generation students encounter leaving home to pursue higher education.</p>
<p>"It became a great discussion about meritocracy, work ethic, staying connected to our communities from afar, and their general fears about college," Garay-Solis says.</p>
<p>Leading the class, Garay-Solis saw another common barrier first-generation students face: academic materials tend to lack minority perspectives. <br/><br/>&#8220;For some of the students it was difficult to grasp why research was focusing on the experiences of brown students,&#8221; Garay-Solis said. <br/><br/>She plans to pursue a masters or doctorate in psychology and hopes to provide analysis that influences legislation. Meanwhile, Garay-Solis is excited she&#8217;s contributing to UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s support for first-generation students. <br/><br/>&#8220;I think some of the things we&#8217;re doing will be incredibly impactful,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just going to help students in the distant future, it&#8217;s going to help in the next two years.

<p>A new study of the climate impacts of seafood products reveals that the processing of Alaskan pollock into fish sticks, imitation crab, and fish fillets generates significant greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Post-catch processing generates nearly twice the emissions produced by fishing itself, which is typically where the analysis of the climate impact of seafood ends, according to the findings by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"The food system is a significant source of global greenhouse gas emissions, and Alaskan pollock is one of the biggest fisheries in the world," said Brandi McKuin, a postdoctoral researcher in environmental studies at UCSC. "These findings highlight the need to take a comprehensive approach to analyzing the climate impacts of the food sector."</p>
<p>McKuin is the lead author on a <a href="https://www.elementascience.org/articles/10.1525/elementa.386/">new paper</a> that appears online in the journal <em>Elementa: Science of the Anthropocene</em>. Titled "Climate Forcing by Battered-and-breaded Fillets and Crab-flavored sticks from Alaska Pollock," the paper takes a detailed, comprehensive look at the climate impact of the seafood supply chain.</p>
<p>Alaskan pollock is sold as fillets and trim pieces that are used to make products like fish sticks and imitation crab, said McKuin. "It's a huge market," she said.</p>
<p>Unlike previous studies that have largely overlooked the downstream processing activities associated with Alaskan pollock, this study examined all the components of the supply chain, from fishing through the retail display case. The results identify "hot spots" where the seafood industry could concentrate its efforts to reduce its climate impacts, said McKuin.</p>
<p>The authors analyzed the climate impacts of transoceanic shipping of exported seafood products, and their study is the first to consider the climate effects of so-called "short-lived" pollutants in the carbon footprint of seafood.</p>
<p>They found that Alaskan pollock is a relatively fuel-efficient fishery: Pollock are caught in large nets called midwater trawls that are towed behind boats, hauling in a lot of fish in each landing, and reducing the climate impact of the fishing process. After the catch, Alaskan pollock are shipped for processing, and in some cases, transported on large container ships that burn copious amounts of fuel, including cheaper, poor-quality bunker fuel that produces high levels of sulfur particles.</p>
<p>McKuin noted that sulfur oxides from ship fuels have a climate-cooling effect. "Seafood products that are exported have a lower climate impact than domestic seafood products," she said, adding that the climate impacts of shipping will change this year as new regulations for cleaner marine fuels take effect. "Shipping has a massive influence on climate and a shift to cleaner fuels will diminish the cooling effect from sulfur oxides and increase the climate impact of products that undergo transoceanic shipping, including seafood," said McKuin.</p>
<p>Coauthor Elliot Campbell, a professor of environmental studies at UCSC, is a pioneer of data-driven methods of assessing the climate impact of food production.</p>
<p>"This study highlights the need to expand our view to encompass the entire supply chain," he said. "It's not enough to look just at fishing. The picture is much bigger, and it's much more complicated."</p>
<p>Organizations like Seafood Watch have developed tools to calculate the carbon footprint of seafood but haven't included processing yet, noted McKuin, adding, "This study adds more data, so they can create a better tool."</p>

<p>Co-presented in collaboration with UCSC&#8217;s Institute of the Arts and Sciences (IAS), the show explores the politics of borders as they intersect with issues of sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity, and race.</p>
<p>Through video installations and performance documenta&#173;tion, <em>We The Enemy </em>explores histories suppressed, untold, and often unspeakable&#8212;including the persecution of LGBTQIA+ people in America, issues of theology and the church, and the history of medical research and HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>The exhibition documents these repressed histories to create a strong and powerful record of rising resistance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Motta&#8217;s art practice has been consistently dedicated to probing difficult questions about politics and the body,&#8221; noted UCSC history of art and visual culture professor Jennifer Gonz&#225;lez. <span></span>&#8220;Tying landscapes of desire to systems of power, <em>We The Enemy</em> will incite our students to link present conditions of injustice to deeper histories of violence,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p><strong>In conjunction with the exhibition</strong>, the artist has collaborated with Institute of the Arts and Sciences curator and interim director Rachel Nelson to produce a symposium titled <a href="https://ias.ucsc.edu/content/2019/bodies-borders-schedule"><strong><em>Bodies on the Border</em></strong></a>&#8212;which is designed to bring together artists, activists, and scholars to further examine the geopolitics of borders.</p>
<p>Featuring film screenings, poetry readings, performances, and panel discussions, the two-day event takes place on January 24 at UC Santa Cruz, and on January 25 at the <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/"><strong><em>San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA)</em></strong></a><em>,</em> where Motta&#8217;s new 4-channel video installation on LGBTQI Dreamers, <em>We Got Each Other&#8217;s Back--Chapter 1: Narrative Shifter: A Portrait of Julio Salgado</em>, is currently on view as part of a multi-artist exhibition titled <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibitions/"><strong><em>Soft Power.</em></strong></a></p>
<p>The symposium is a reflection of Motta&#8217;s commitment to activism and education in the arts. He has previously produced a variety of symposia, including events at the Tate Modern in London, the New Museum in New York, and the Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art in Rotterdam.</p>
<p>For those events, the artist invited key thinkers, activists, and artists to address the social and political concerns that his art practice also engages, in an effort to emphasize the importance of art in public and civic education.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are thrilled to host Motta&#8217;s West Coast premiere solo exhibition and to collaborate with the artist and SFMOMA on the related symposium,&#8221; said Nelson. &#8220;This mode of combining art, education, and civic learning is well-suited for UC Santa Cruz and confirms the Institute of the Arts and Sciences&#8217; commitment to art and public engagement.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Motta&#8217;s work is represented</strong> in the permanent collections of the The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Guggenheim Museum, New York; Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid; Museo de Arte Contemporaneo de Barcelona; and Museo de Arte de Banco de la Rep&#250;blica, Bogot&#225;.</p>
<p>He has been awarded the Vilcek Foundation's Prize for Creative Promise (2017); the PinchukArtCentre's Future Generation Art Prize (2014); and a Guggenheim Fellowship.</p>
<p>A New York-based artist who was born in Bogot&#225;, Colombia, Motta was the subject of a 2018 career survey exhibition at the Museo de Arte Moderno de Medell&#237;n, Colombia and Matucana 100, Santiago, Chile.&#160;His films have recently been screened at the Rotterdam Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival, and&#160;Internationale Kurzfilmtage Winterthur, Switzerland.</p>

The program was established with an initial four-year grant in 2015, with the goal of diversifying the conservation field.</p>
<p>Each year, the program recruits 20 early-career college students to participate in two years of experiential training in field research and conservation leadership. The scholars represent a diverse spectrum of cultures and backgrounds, which helps to cultivate an inclusive and rewarding experience, according to the program&#8217;s faculty director Erika Zavaleta, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to build on our successes to date and will continue to refine our program over the next four years,&#8221; Zavaleta said.</p>
<p>The program&#8217;s participants so far have come from 34 U.S. states and territories, representing over 50 colleges and universities across the country, as well as a broad range of disciplines, including the arts, creative writing, sociology, engineering, computer science, policy, law, business, and biological sciences.</p>
<p>Each cohort brings much-needed diversity to the conservation field, Zavaleta said. While not all of the scholars are from underrepresented backgrounds, she noted that the 2019 cohort includes Native American, Native Hawiian and Pacific Islander, African-American, and Latinx men and women who are passionate about the conservation of wildlife, land, and biodiversity, and just and effective means to achieve those goals.</p>
<p>The program begins with an intensive summer field course in conservation research, practice, and leadership. Traveling with a close group of peers and mentors, the scholars visit sites in the UC Natural Reserve System, getting hands-on experience and building community.</p>
<p>The second year involves a paid summer internship with a conservation organization or agency. Hosts for the internships have included the National Marine Fisheries Service, Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, Natural Resources Defense Council, and Conservation Metrics.</p>
<p>Alumni of the program are pursuing a variety of paths in conservation across a range of sectors, including academia, non-governmental organizations, and tribal, state, and federal government. Many of the scholars have gone on to pursue graduate degrees in conservation fields, and several alumni have received prestigious fellowships and scholarships, including the Rhodes Scholarship, Fulbright Scholarship, Truman Scholarship, RAY Clean Energy Fellowship, Udall Scholarship, and Princeton in Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our scholars and alumni are already becoming leaders and influencers in conservation and beginning to bring to fruition the program&#8217;s vision of a diverse group of future conservation leaders,&#8221; Zavaleta said.</p>
<p>In addition to renewed funding for the next four years, the UC Santa Cruz program has also received a $100,000 grant from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation to host a gathering of Native American Conservation Scholars in the coming year, for which Zavaleta worked with Mary Adelzadeh, a member of the program&#8217;s advisory board. A member of the Navajo Nation and herself an alumna of a graduate-level Doris Duke Conservation Fellowship program, Adelzadeh aims to create a network of Native American Conservation Scholars to help connect, amplify, and support Native voices in conservation.</p>
<p>&#8220;This gathering will provide networking and education on career opportunities, and create synergies through idea and information exchange,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program at UC Santa Cruz draws on UCSC&#8217;s deep resources and strengths in hands-on conservation, building close cohort communities through shared experiences and connections between students and mentors. The program emphasizes cultivating the skills and tools essential for career success, leadership, innovation, and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is the only Conservation Scholars site at a diverse, minority-serving institution with campus-wide strength in conservation, experiential learning, and educating first-generation college students and students of color.</p>
<p>The Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program at UC Santa Cruz is currently recruiting for its 2020 summer cohort.

It was all about the asteroid impact.</p>
<p>In a break from a number of other recent studies, the researchers argue that environmental impacts from massive volcanic eruptions in India in the region known as the Deccan Traps happened well before the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago and therefore did not contribute to the mass extinction.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bottom line is that the meteorite impact was the primary cause of the extinction event. With high-fidelity records, we can now resolve the relative contributions of volcanic carbon dioxide emissions to the changes in climate through the event, and it&#8217;s clear the effects were more or less over by the time of the event,&#8221; said coauthor James Zachos, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The new study, led by Yale geologist Pincelli Hull, was published January 16 in <em>Science</em>.</p>
<p>Most scientists acknowledge that the mass extinction event, also known as K-Pg, occurred after an asteroid slammed into Earth. Some researchers also have focused on the role of volcanoes in K-Pg due to indications that volcanic activity happened around the same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Volcanoes can drive mass extinctions because they release lots of gases, like sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide, that can alter the climate and acidify the world,&#8221; said Hull, lead author of the new study. &#8220;But recent work has focused on the timing of lava eruption rather than gas release.&#8221;</p>
<p>To pinpoint the timing of volcanic gas emission, Hull and her colleagues compared global temperature change and the carbon isotopes from marine fossils with models of the climatic effect of carbon dioxide release. Zachos was involved in the design and implementation of two of the ocean drilling expeditions that recovered the sediment cores used in the study to constrain the tempo and magnitude of the climatic changes.</p>
<p>The researchers concluded that most of the gas release happened well before the asteroid impact, and that the asteroid was the sole driver of extinction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Volcanic activity in the late Cretaceous caused a gradual global warming event of about two degrees, but not mass extinction,&#8221; said former Yale researcher Michael Henehan, who compiled the temperature records for the study. &#8220;A number of species moved toward the North and South poles but moved back well before the asteroid impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Added Hull, &#8220;A lot of people have speculated that volcanoes mattered to K-Pg, and we&#8217;re saying, &#8216;No, they didn&#8217;t.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Recent work on the Deccan Traps, in India, has also pointed to massive eruptions in the immediate aftermath of the K-Pg mass extinction. These results have puzzled scientists because there is no warming event to match. The new study suggests an answer to this puzzle, as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;The K-Pg extinction was a mass extinction and this profoundly altered the global carbon cycle,&#8221; said Yale postdoctoral associate Donald Penman, the study&#8217;s modeler, who earned his Ph.D. at UCSC in 2016. &#8220;Our results show that these changes would allow the ocean to absorb an enormous amount of carbon dioxide on long time scales, perhaps hiding the warming effects of volcanism in the aftermath of the event.&#8221;</p>
<p>German researcher Andr&#233; Bornemann was co-lead author of the study. The coauthors include researchers from institutions in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Japan, Denmark, and the United States. The International Ocean Discovery Program, the National Science Foundation, and Yale University helped fund the research.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ca5e720180727017465cacceb3a92903"><name>campus-reaches-new-contract-skilled-trade-employees</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus reaches new contract with skilled trades employees</title><summary>I am pleased to announce that UC Santa Cruz has reached a new four-year contract with its skilled trades employees.</summary><start-date>1579593600000</start-date><display-name>Campus reaches new contract with skilled trades employees</display-name><path>/2020/01/campus-reaches-new-contract-skilled-trade-employees</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/01/campus-reaches-new-contract-skilled-trade-employees</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1579648184805</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1579648184805</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>I am pleased to announce that UC Santa Cruz has reached a new four-year contract with its skilled trades employees.

<p>The faculty&#8217;s community-centered pioneering field psycholinguistic work into Chamorro, Zapotec, and other languages particularly stood out to him. Arvindam said it is imperative for linguists to conduct such work in a manner that gives back and benefits the language community at large.</p>
<p>Arvindam earned his bachelor's degree in linguistics and psychology from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and spent a year as the lab manager of the Child Language Lab at New York University before he arrived at UC Santa Cruz in the fall.</p>
<p>"I was captivated by what linguistics has to offer to the study of the human mind and this seemed like the logical next step," he said "I have a lot to gain from the department and other graduate students. It's the community I came for."</p>
<p>Arvindam is particularly interested in psycholinguistics, the study of how humans acquire, use, and understand language. Much research has been done on the world's major languages, with others left unstudied.</p>
<p>"It's a very narrow slice of the world&#8217;s languages," Arvindam said. "If we want to make claims about how the mind works we need to be more expansive."</p>
<p>He's particularly interested in studying Dravidian languages&#8212;those spoken by more than 200 million people in South India and Sri Lanka-and expects to conduct psycholinguistic fieldwork in the area as he progresses along in his studies.</p>
<p>After he earns his doctoral degree, Arvindam hopes to become a professor so that he can teach and inspire students who are fascinated by linguistics and the mystery of the human mind. <br/><br/><br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ce7943d380727017465caccefd3298b1"><name>hernadez-first-gen</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>The power of research</title><summary>Wilfrido HernÃ¡ndez Flores discovered social science research in the Culture and Achievement Collaborative, and it changed his life</summary><keywords>culture and achievement collaborative, first-gen, undergraduate research</keywords><start-date>1579712400000</start-date><display-name>The power of research</display-name><path>/2020/01/hernadez-first-gen</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/01/hernadez-first-gen</link><created-by>jhillard</created-by><created-on>1579717051308</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1580250652587</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Education</value><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>StoryCruz</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>J.D.

I highly recommend you get involved in research.&#8221; Hern&#225;ndez wasn't sure about this&#8212;he'd just been thinking he'd get a degree and be on his way&#8212;but he gave it more thought, and not long after that meeting he found a research topic.<br/><br/>Hern&#225;ndez (Carson &#8216;19, psychology/community studies) had a growing sense of guilt about leaving his home in Los Angeles. He couldn't put a name to it until he read an article by Psychology Professor Rebecca Covarrubias and learned about the concept of &#8220;family achievement guilt.&#8221; First-generation college students in particular may feel a sense of guilt at the difference in opportunities they experience compared with their parents and other family members. <br/><br/>It was validating to see his personal experience reflected in the research, and Hern&#225;ndez ended up doing his own senior thesis under Professor Covarrubias&#8217;s supervision as a member of her <a href="https://rcovarrubias.sites.ucsc.edu/">Culture and Achievement Collaborative</a>. <br/><br/>&#8220;My research really tried to shed light on why these students experience this,&#8221; he says. <br/><br/>His research project found different reasons why low-income, first-generation students report experiencing family achievement guilt, such as not being able to help their families through economic struggle. The finding could help focus institutional practices&#8212;Hern&#225;ndez and his fellow researchers suggested continued work to identify how the university could alleviate feelings of family achievement guilt. <br/><br/>Hern&#225;ndez hopes this research to serve as a validating and empowering tool for the university to continue supporting low-income, first-generation students.<br/><br/>Following his graduation in 2019, Hern&#225;ndez took a position with a Santa Cruz&#8211;area research firm. He says the experience in the Collab was transformational and rewarding. He had never considered a career involving research; now Hern&#225;ndez plans to attend graduate school. <br/><br/>He ultimately hopes to become a university professor, using his research experience as a foundation for addressing issues of underrepresentation.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page type="page"><content></content><path>/2020/01/reina-solis</path><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Mathematics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>International</value><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Experiential Learning</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>StoryCruz</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><link>site://news/2020/01/reina-solis</link><site>news</site><name>reina-solis</name><display-name>first-gen-researcher-solis</display-name><title>Breaking down barriers to success</title><summary>First-gen student Reina Garay-Solis is doing undergraduate research to help identify common challenges for first-gen and underrepresented students and find effective institutional practices to address them&#13;

UC Santa Cruz will present "Reporting the Middle East and the Future of Investigative Journalism"&#8212;the sixth installment of its signature <em><strong>Questions That Matter</strong></em> series&#8212;on Tuesday, February 4, at Kuumbwa Jazz Center in downtown Santa Cruz.<br/><br/>The inaugural event of UCSC&#8217;s new <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/12/middle-east-center.html"><strong><em>Center for the Middle East and North Africa</em></strong></a>, the evening will feature the center&#8217;s founding director and associate professor of history Jennifer Derr in conversation with veteran <em>NPR</em> journalists Hannah Allam and Leila Fadel. <br/><br/>The two international correspondents have worked extensively in the Middle East--including in Iraq during the aftermath of the U.S. invasion--and they are currently reporting on questions of culture, race, and diversity in the United States. <br/><br/>&#8220;This event will be an opportunity for members of the UCSC community and the Santa Cruz community at large to engage with what it means to do journalism in today's world,&#8221; said Derr. &#8220;It will also be a chance for all of us to understand how the profession has changed and the challenges--in both the Middle East and the United States--that its practitioners confront.&#8221;<br/><br/>Derr noted that the <em>NPR</em> journalists will discuss how news is produced about the Middle East, and how that news comes to the American public. They will also discuss the work of reporting on questions of culture, race, and extremism in today's America. <br/><br/>&#8220;The focus of our conversation will concern the contexts within which Fadel and Allam have worked and work currently,&#8221; said Derr. &#8220;In the Middle East, those moments include the Iraq War, the Arab Spring, and the war in Syria. We will discuss how the process of reporting the Middle East has changed in the past decade, and what the implications of this are for what the public understands about the region--an important subject in light of the rising tensions between the Trump administration and the Iranian regime.&#8221;<br/><br/>Fadel is currently is a national correspondent for <em>NPR</em>, covering issues of culture, diversity, and race in America. Previously, Fadel worked as a journalist in the Middle East. She covered the Iraq War for nearly five years working for Knight Ridder, McClatchy Newspapers, and later the <em>Washington Post</em>. She also covered the uprisings that comprised the Arab Spring as the Cairo bureau chief for the <em>Washington Post</em> and as an international correspondent for <em>NPR</em>. <br/><br/>Fadel&#8217;s foreign coverage of the human toll of the Iraq war earned her the George. R. Polk award in 2007. She was also awarded the Lowell Thomas Award from the Overseas Press Club for her coverage of the 2013 coup in Egypt and its effect on the country and Egyptian families. And in 2017, she earned a Gracie award for the story of a single mother in Tunisia whose two eldest daughters were brainwashed and joined ISIS. <br/><br/>Her coverage has also included stories of human smugglers in Egypt and the desperate Syrian families that were willing to pay to risk their lives and cross the ocean for Europe.<br/><br/>Allam is a Washington-based national security correspondent for <em>NPR</em>, focusing on homegrown extremism. Before joining <em>NPR</em>, she worked as a national correspondent at <em>BuzzFeed News</em>, covering U.S. Muslims and other issues of race, religion and culture. Allam previously reported for McClatchy, spending a decade overseas as bureau chief in Baghdad during the Iraq war and in Cairo during the Arab Spring rebellions. <br/><br/>After moving to Washington to cover foreign policy in 2012, she began a yearlong series documenting the rising hostility toward Islam in America, and her coverage of Islam in the United States received three national religion reporting awards in 2018 and 2019. <br/><br/>Allam was also part of McClatchy teams that won an Overseas Press Club award for exposing death squads in Iraq and a Polk Award for reporting on the Syrian conflict. She was a 2009 Nieman fellow at Harvard and has served on the board of the International Women's Media Foundation.<br/><br/>&#8220;As a historian of the Middle East, I closely follow the journalism that concerns the region and the journalists who do this work,&#8221; Derr noted. &#8220;I even include it in the courses that I teach. I pay close attention to who has spent significant time in the region and who understands the nuances of its politics and culture. The work that Fadel and Allam have done in the region stands out. For years, I relied on their coverage of Middle Eastern politics. In the period since both began reporting on domestic affairs, I have followed their work with the same trust and enthusiasm.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;It is my hope that those who attend this event take away a better understanding of how news is made and the challenges that journalists face in bringing us knowledge of the world in which we live,&#8221; she added. <br/>____________________________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>The Hastings Center is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization of research scholars located on the Hudson River north of New York City. Founded in 1969, it brings together scholars from across the disciplines to address ethical questions in medicine, science, and technology with a goal of informing policy, practice, and public understanding.</p>
<p>Reardon is one of 12 new fellows announced today (Jan. 22), joining a group of more than 200 accomplished scholars. In its <a href="https://www.thehastingscenter.org/news/new-hastings-center-fellows-elected-3/">announcement</a>, The Hastings Center said fellows are recognized for their "uncommon insight and impact in areas of critical concern to the Center&#8211;how best to understand and manage the inevitable values questions, moral uncertainties, and societal effects that arise as a consequence of advances in the life sciences, the need to improve health and health care for people of all ages, and mitigation of human impact on the natural world."</p>
<p>Reardon is the author of two books about genomics: <em>Race to the Finish: Identity and Governance in an Age of Genomics</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>The Postgenomic Condition: Ethics, Justice, Knowledge After the Genome</em>.&#160;She has been the recipient of numerous fellowships and awards, including from the National Science Foundation, Max Planck Institute, Humboldt Foundation, Brocher Foundation, and the United States Congressional Committee on Science, Space and Technology.&#160;A strong voice in the public dialogue about genomics, Reardon is regularly asked to speak and advise on the relations between science, medicine and&#160;society.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d8e7056c80727017465cacce9682ec31"><name>falcon-tinker</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Graduate student funds for travel to Latin America available through RCA</title><summary>New funding is available for graduate students traveling to Latin America to conduct preliminary research, thanks to a grant from the Tinker Foundation and matching funds from the university that were received by the Research Center for the Americas.</summary><keywords>tinker, foundation, LALS, latin america, travel</keywords><start-date>1579852800000</start-date><display-name>Falcon-Tinker</display-name><path>/2020/01/falcon-tinker</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/01/falcon-tinker</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1579892016447</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1579892390896</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/01/images/falcon-tinker-map_300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/01/images/falcon-tinker-map_300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>falcon-tinker-map_300.jpg</name><display-name>falcon-tinker-map_300.jpg</display-name><file-size>19586</file-size><width>300</width><height>356</height></image><image-alt>Map of Latin America</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/01/images/falcon-tinker-map_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/01/images/falcon-tinker-map_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>falcon-tinker-map_80.jpg</name><display-name>falcon-tinker-map_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>2463</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Map of Latin America</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><a href="https://rca.ucsc.edu/graduate-students/tinker.html">New funding</a> is available for graduate students traveling to Latin America to conduct preliminary research, thanks to a grant from the Tinker Foundation and matching funds from the university that were received by the <a href="https://rca.ucsc.edu/">Research Center for the Americas</a><span>.</span></p>
<p>"This was our third time applying, and we finally won the award," said RCA Director Sylvanna Falc&#243;n, an associate professor of Latin American and Latino studies. "This positions the campus among a select group of Tinker Foundation institutions, and it opens the door to future support from them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tinker.org/">Tinker Foundation</a> is a private organization that promotes economic and social development in Latin America by funding universities, nonprofits, and research institutes. RCA would not have received the support from Tinker without matching funds provided by the UC Santa Cruz Foundation's<a href="https://foundation.ucsc.edu/opportunity-fund/index.html"> Board Opportunity Fund</a>, the <a href="https://graddiv.ucsc.edu/">Graduate Division</a>, and the <a href="https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/">Office of Research</a>, said Falc&#243;n.</p>
<p>"This broad show of campus support was indispensable," she said. "It sent a strong message to the foundation that the entire campus community was behind this effort to support our graduate students."</p>
<p>Students in all graduate degree programs are eligible to apply for the new research-support funds. The Tinker Foundation's Field Research Grant provides a total of $20,000 over two years to support travel and field-related expenses for short, pre-dissertation summer research trips to Latin America. Travel funds of up to $2,500 will be to awarded to students doing research in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries&#8212;excluding Puerto Rico and Belize, as stipulated by Tinker, noted Falc&#243;n. Matching funds bring the total support available to $40,000 over two years.</p>
<p>The award is being administered in partnership with the <a href="https://lals.ucsc.edu/">Latin American and Latino Studies Department</a>.</p>
<p>"The number of scholars on our campus working on and in Latin America has increased substantially since the establishment of our doctoral program in 2013," said Falc&#243;n. "We launched the world's first doctoral program in Latin American and Latino studies, and UCSC is an auspicious place to do this important work."</p>
<p>A cross-disciplinary faculty committee chaired and organized by the RCA will evaluate applications. More information, including the <a href="https://rca.ucsc.edu/documents/cfa-for-2020-tinker-final-1.pdf">call for applications</a>, is available <a href="https://rca.ucsc.edu/graduate-students/tinker.html">online</a>.

<p>Integral geometry is the mathematics behind a range of imaging techniques such as computerized tomography (CT) and other medical imaging technologies. Other applications include seismic imaging of Earth&#8217;s interior, imaging techniques for homeland security, and polarimetric neutron tomography for imaging magnetic fields inside materials.</p>
<p>&#8220;The basic problem is to reconstruct the internal features of something based on an understanding of how particles or waves propagate through it, and problems of integral geometry arise when the measurements take the form of cumulative values along a family of trajectories,&#8221; Monard said.</p>
<p>Applications such as CT scans are widely used and highly successful, but researchers continue to push the limits of these technologies. &#8220;Some applications should take into account that information often propagates along curves instead of straight lines, and addressing this issue is one of the main geometric motivations of my project&#8221;, Monard said.</p>
<p>Monard will pursue several avenues of investigation to address core questions in integral geometry. His approach combines deep theoretical tools in geometry and analysis with a concern for implementability to produce explicit answers. The project will also address practical issues such as noisy data, sampling, and uncertainty quantification, using methods from theoretical statistics and signal processing.</p>
<p>The funding for this project includes support for graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher, as well as undergraduate research opportunities. Monard also plans to host two regional workshops on integral geometry and its applications, aimed at graduate students working in this area at West Coast institutions.</p>
<p>The CAREER Awards are NSF's most prestigious awards in support of early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and to lead advances in the mission of their department or organization. The award provides $425,000 over five years to support Monard&#8217;s research, education, and outreach activities.</p>
<p>Monard earned his Ph.D. in applied mathematics at Columbia University and joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 2016.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d995e44780727017465cacce82458e20"><name>my-ucsc-planned-outage</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>MyUCSC Planned Outage, Jan. 25</title><summary>MyUCSC and affiliated AIS systems will be unavailable Saturday, Jan. 25, from 8 AM to 5 PM for routine system maintenance.</summary><start-date>1579852800000</start-date><display-name>MyUCSC Planned Outage, Jan. 25</display-name><path>/2020/01/my-ucsc-planned-outage</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/01/my-ucsc-planned-outage</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1579903476755</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1579903476755</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div><span>UCSC&#160;and affiliated AIS systems will be unavailable Saturday,&#160;Jan. 25, from 8 AM to 5 PM for routine system maintenance.</span><br/><br/><span>Please refer to the ITS Maintenance Calendar for details:&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gnldr.online/tracker/click?redirect%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fits.ucsc.edu%252Fchange-mgmt%252Fcalendar2.html%26dID%3D1579896140205&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1579989095413000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHw0BGKtNbh68gEVi4n-xm6kAnX2A" href="https://gnldr.online/tracker/click?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fits.ucsc.edu%2Fchange-mgmt%2Fcalendar2.html&amp;dID=1579896140205" rel="noopener" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://its.ucsc.edu/change-mgmt/calendar2.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://its.<span>ucsc</span>.edu/<wbr/>change-mgmt/calendar2.html</a><strong><br/></strong></div>

Most patients have had mild illnesses although a few are very sick or have died. As of this morning, two people have tested positive in the United States. No cases have been identified in California.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>How is UCSC Student Health Services protecting the campus community?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>At the Student Health Center, we check anyone with acute illness for their travel history and/or possible exposure to the virus. We also work closely with our local public health department and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). We follow their guidance about testing, treatment, and communications.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>How can I stay healthy if I&#8217;m traveling?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>CDC recommends avoiding non-essential travel to Wuhan, China. Take the following precautions if traveling to other parts of China:</span></p>

A new study shows how the record-breaking marine heat wave of 2014 to 2016 caused changes along the U.S. West Coast that led to an unprecedented spike in the numbers of whales that became entangled in fishing gear.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the ocean warming, we saw a shift in the ecosystem and in the feeding behavior of humpback whales that led to a greater overlap between whales and crab fishing gear,&#8221; said Jarrod Santora, a researcher in applied mathematics at UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering and first author of the study, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-14215-w">published January 27 in <em>Nature Communications</em></a>.</p>
<p>Santora, who is also affiliated with the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center, uses data-driven models of marine ecosystems to inform fishery management and conservation. As science advisor for a working group convened to address the whale entanglement problem, he has been providing his analyses to state and federal agencies to help them make management decisions that can reduce the risk of entanglement.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a perfect storm of events over those three years, but we now have the ability to prevent that from happening again,&#8221; Santora said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve developed a risk assessment and mitigation program, we&#8217;re doing aerial surveys, and we&#8217;re providing ecosystem-based indicators to the state resource managers so they can make informed decisions. There&#8217;s a huge team of people working on this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The high productivity of the California Current is supported by wind-driven upwelling of cool, nutrient-rich water along the coast, which sustains large populations of prey (such as krill, anchovy, and sardines) that attract whales and other predators. The intensity of upwelling and the extent of cool enriched water off the coast varies from year to year, but the extreme warming event in 2014-16 (which became known as the &#8220;warm blob&#8221;) compressed this prime habitat into a very narrow band along the coast, Santora explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Predators that are normally more spread out offshore all moved inshore because that&#8217;s where the food was,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Krill populations always take a hit during warming events, but we started to see an increase in anchovy. Humpback whales are unique in their ability to switch between krill and small fish, so during those years they moved inshore after the anchovy.&#8221;</p>
<p>That shift brought an unusual number of whales into areas where they were more likely to encounter crab fishing gear. Humpback whale entanglements, which averaged about 10 per year prior to 2014, shot up to 53 confirmed entanglements in 2015 and remained high at 55 confirmed entanglements in 2016.</p>
<p>Further complicating the situation was another consequence of the marine heat wave, an unprecedented bloom of toxic algae along the West Coast. When scientists detected dangerous levels of the neurotoxin domoic acid in Dungeness crabs, the opening of the 2015-16 crab fishing season was delayed until late March 2016. Normally, crab fishing activity is highest in November and December, but in 2016, peak fishing activity coincided with the arrival of migrating whales off California in April and May.</p>
<p>&#8220;All this gear was going out right during the peak arrival of whales, so that made things worse,&#8221; Santora said. &#8220;But 2016 is not the whole story. We started to see an increase in whale entanglements in late 2014, well before the delayed crab season, and that was due to the habitat compression along the coast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another factor, he said, is the ongoing recovery of whale populations. Conservation efforts that began in the 1960s have enabled many populations that were decimated by commercial whaling to begin making a comeback. Although some North Pacific humpback whale populations are still considered threatened or endangered, their overall numbers have been increasing.</p>
<p>According to Santora, the events of 2014-16 show how important it is for scientists to work closely and communicate clearly with fisheries managers and other stakeholders. One positive outcome of the entanglement crisis was the creation of the <a href="http://www.opc.ca.gov/whale-entanglement-working-group/">California Dungeness Crab Fishing Gear Working Group</a>, which includes commercial fishermen, state and federal resource managers, conservationists, and scientists. The group has developed a <a href="http://www.opc.ca.gov/risk-assessment-and-mitigation-program-ramp/">Risk Assessment and Mitigation Program</a> to support collaborative efforts to reduce entanglements.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody wants to entangle whales,&#8221; Santora said. &#8220;People are working to develop ropeless gear, but broad application of that new technology is still far in the future. For now, the best we can do is to monitor the situation closely and get ecosystem science information to the people who need it.&#8221;</p>

This extreme slip at shallow depths exacerbated the massive tsunami that, together with the magnitude 9.1 earthquake, caused extensive damage and loss of life in Japan.</p>
<p>In a new study, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14447-1">published January 27 in <em>Nature Communications</em></a>, researchers used a novel technique to study the faults in the Japan Trench, the subduction zone where the Tohoku-Oki earthquake struck. Their findings reveal a long history of large earthquakes in this fault zone, where they found multiple faults with evidence of more than 10 meters of slip during large earthquakes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found evidence of many large earthquakes that have ruptured to the seafloor and could have generated tsunamis like the one that struck in 2011,&#8221; said coauthor Pratigya Polissar, associate professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Japanese researchers looking at onshore sediment deposits have found evidence of at least three similar tsunamis having occurred in this region at roughly 1,000-year intervals. The new study suggests there have been even more large earthquakes on this fault zone than those that left behind onshore evidence of big tsunamis, said coauthor Heather Savage, associate professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Savage and Polissar have developed a technique for assessing the history of earthquake slip on a fault by analyzing organic molecules trapped in sedimentary rocks. Originally synthesized by marine algae and other organisms, these &#8220;biomarkers&#8221; are altered or destroyed by heat, including the frictional heating that occurs when a fault slips during an earthquake. Through extensive laboratory testing over the past decade, Savage and Polissar have developed methods for quantifying the thermal evolution of these biomarkers and using them to reconstruct the temperature history of a fault.</p>
<p>The Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project (JFAST) drilled into the fault zone in 2012, extracting cores and installing a temperature observatory. UCSC seismologist Emily Brodsky helped organize JFAST, which yielded the first direct measurement of the frictional heat produced by the fault slip during an earthquake (see <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2013/12/slippery-fault.html">earlier story</a>). This heat dissipates after the earthquake, however, so the signal is small and transient.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biomarkers give us a way to detect permanent changes in the rock that preserve a record of heating on the fault,&#8221; Savage said.</p>
<p>For the new study, the researchers examined the JFAST cores, which extended through the fault zone into the subducting plate below. &#8220;It&#8217;s a complex fault zone, and there were a lot of faults throughout the core. We were able to say which faults had evidence of large earthquakes in the past,&#8221; Savage said.</p>
<p>One of their goals was to understand whether some rock types in the fault zone were more prone to large slip in an earthquake than other rocks. The cores passed through layers of mudstones and clays with different frictional strengths. But the biomarker analysis showed evidence of large seismic slip on faults in all the different rock types. The researchers concluded that differences in frictional properties do not necessarily determine the likelihood of large shallow slip or seismic hazard.</p>
<p>Savage and Polissar began working on the biomarker technique as postdoctoral researchers at UC Santa Cruz, publishing their first paper on it with Brodsky in 2011. They continued developing it as researchers at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, before returning to UC Santa Cruz as faculty members in 2019. Hannah Rabinowitz, the first author of the new paper, worked with them as a graduate student at Columbia and is now a AAAS Science Policy Fellow at the U.S. Department of Energy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve tested this technique in different rocks with different ages and heating histories, and we can now say yes, there was an earthquake on this fault, and we can tell if there was a large one or many small ones,&#8221; Savage said. &#8220;We can now take this technique to other faults to learn more about their histories.&#8221;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Additional information</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">NEW: 5-year/50% program</h2>
<p>Beginning in fall 2020, UC Santa Cruz will be offering new and continuing doctoral and MFA students support packages of 5 years (2 for MFA) with a minimum level of support equivalent to a 50% teaching assistantship. In total, this program will bring all doctoral and MFA student support&#8212;stipend, fees, tuition, GSHIP, etc. up to a minimum of $43,000 annually.</p>
<h3>Who is eligible?</h3>
<p>New and continuing doctoral student beginning in fall 2020. M.F.A. students will have a comparable guarantee for 2 years. Students must be in residence and in good standing with less than 15 quarters of enrollment (6 quarters for M.F.A. students).</p>
<h3>Is this a full-year program?</h3>
<p>All admission offers to doctoral students in the 2020-21 will guarantee 5 years of support for 3 academic quarters per year (F,W,S) at at least the financial level of a 49.99% time Teaching Assistantship (for the 19-20 academic year, this is &#126;$2434/month).</p>
<h3>Will all eligible students become TAs?</h3>
<p>The support will comprise some combination of Teaching Assistantship, Fellowship, or Graduate Student Researchership, depending on programmatic and institutional funding sources.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">NEW: Housing supplement</h2>
<p>Also in fall 2020, the campus will begin offering an annual housing supplement of $2,500 for doctoral and MFA students in good standing until additional campus graduate student housing is available. <em>(<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/02/cpevc-clarification-grad-programs.html">Feb. 24 update</a>:&#160;Doctoral and MFA students who resume their TA/GSI appointment obligations will receive the $2,500 housing supplement retroactive to Sept. 1, 2019, for the 2019-20 academic year. Doctoral and MFA students supported through GSR/Fellowship appointments will be included in the retroactive receipt of the housing supplement available at the end of the academic year.)</em></p>
<h3>Will these initiatives fundamentally solve the problem of lack of housing?</h3>
<p>These initiatives do not result in the construction of any new housing, so in a narrow sense no. However, these initiatives achieve two goals&#8212;first, they provide financial certainty and predictability for graduate students about the income they will receive through a standard completion time. Second, through a partnership between the Financial Aid Office and the Graduate Division, they provide additional support for those graduate students who may still struggle with housing affordability.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz houses more than half of its undergraduates and is committed to providing even more student housing. Student Housing West&#8212;held up in litigation&#8212;will create 3,000 new beds on campus for current undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
<h3>When will applications be available?</h3>
<p>Students will need to file a FASFA or Dream App, if eligible. These forms are available year-round. Students will need to submit a program application by July 1. The program application will be available by May 1.</p>
<h3>When will you begin to administer the funds?</h3>
<p>Fall 2020.<em> (<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/02/cpevc-clarification-grad-programs.html">Feb. 24 update</a>: Doctoral and MFA students who resume their TA/GSI appointment obligations will receive the $2,500 housing supplement retroactive to Sept. 1, 2019, for the 2019-20 academic year. Doctoral and MFA students supported through GSR/Fellowship appointments will be included in the retroactive receipt of the housing supplement available at the end of the academic year.)</em></p>
<h3>What if I need help now?</h3>
<p>Slug Support is offering <a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/slug-support/program/grad-student-temp-housing.html">two temporary housing assistance programs</a> to graduate students. These include a program to support gaps in rent (or other housing related costs) for this academic year or summer, and a security deposit assistance program. For both of these programs, students can receive up to $1,000 in financial support. These temporary programs will be offered until May 31st, 2020. <br/><br/>These programs are in addition to Slug Support&#8217;s existing year-round emergency housing fund that graduate students have access to for these needs as well. These funds are available to any graduate student who may be in need of this support following an assessment with a Slug Support case manager to determine eligibility and availability. To schedule an appointment with a Slug Support case manager, email deanofstudents@ucsc.edu.</p>

The first two &#8212; solidifying our status as a research leader and promoting student success &#8212; go to the heart of ensuring our educational and research excellence, and are issues that I would like to address today.</p>
<p>Key to achieving these goals is strengthening and diversifying our graduate programs. Though graduate students in doctoral and masters of fine arts programs are supported through fellowships, research and teaching assistantships, the cost of housing in Santa Cruz County remains a financial burden for many. The ability of UC Santa Cruz to address this need is hampered because our campus ranks at the bottom of the UC system relative to the number of graduate housing units. We simply have nowhere near the number of units we need to support our graduate students.</p>
<p>If we are to continue to pioneer and transform research through the application of diverse perspectives, we must demonstrate our commitment by ensuring that we can attract and support the best qualified and most innovative graduate students. To that end, I am pleased to announce <a href="new-graduate-student-programs.xml">two new programs</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, beginning in fall 2020, we will offer new and continuing doctoral students support packages for five years (two years for MFA students). These packages will have a minimum level of support equivalent to that of a 50 percent teaching assistantship.</li>
<li>Second, until more graduate-level student housing becomes available, we are instituting an annual housing supplement of $2,500 for doctoral and MFA students offered through the Graduate Division.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two new programs further enhance the overall financial package our doctoral and MFA students receive to assist them in their academic progress and pursuit of an advanced degree.</p>
<p>Also, integral to our commitment to educational excellence is our obligation to our undergraduate students, which requires that we do everything possible to ensure their success. We know that a degree from UC Santa Cruz has the potential to change the trajectory of lives. Unfortunately, recent actions by some graduate students to withhold or delete grades only hurts the very students who depend on us.</p>
<p>When students do not have grades, it can profoundly impact financial aid, as well as the ability of some students to enroll in needed classes, apply for graduation, or even declare a major. It also can impact requirements of student athletes, student veterans, and those under academic review. Withholding grades also makes it more difficult for us to work together on tangible steps that we can take to help address the core, underlying issue &#8212; our lack of affordable housing.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has a proud history of activism, and the university is committed to ensuring that all people may exercise the constitutionally protected rights of free expression, speech, and assembly. And while I commend our students for drawing attention to a very real problem, I am extremely disappointed that some graduate students chose to do so in a way that was unsanctioned by their union and is harmful to our undergraduate students, many of whom are struggling themselves. As this grade strike continues, I am deeply concerned about the impact on undergraduates. Therefore, graduate students who do not submit grades by Feb. 2, 2020, will receive a written disciplinary warning in accordance with the UC/UAW contract. Students alleged to have deleted grades will receive a student conduct summons.</p>
<p>A lack of affordable housing is not a problem unique to Santa Cruz. It is endemic to California. I sympathize with students who are impacted by the lack of affordable housing locally, as well as the generally high cost of living here. I believe the introduction of these two new programs demonstrates a commitment to our graduate students and will make a significant and tangible impact on their lives.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that more work needs to be done and I&#8217;m looking forward to collaborating on new ways of addressing ongoing problems. UC Santa Cruz is on a great trajectory and I&#8217;m confident that by working together we will be able to continue to achieve educational and research excellence.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e90927f080727017465cacce5e47be25"><name>kahana-in-memoriam</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Jonathan Kahana (1966-2019)</title><keywords>jonathan kahana</keywords><start-date>1580163300000</start-date><display-name>In Memoriam: Jonathan Kahana</display-name><path>/2020/01/kahana-in-memoriam</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/01/kahana-in-memoriam</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1580162688977</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1580163609989</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/01/images/jonathan-kahana-375.png</path><link>site://news/2020/01/images/jonathan-kahana-375.png</link><site>news</site><name>jonathan-kahana-375.png</name><display-name>jonathan-kahana-375.png</display-name><file-size>319054</file-size><width>375</width><height>296</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Department of Film and Digital Media is deeply shocked and saddened by the loss of our colleague, Professor Jonathan Kahana, after a protracted battle with a rare form of cancer. Jonathan passed away on December 31, 2019, at the age of just 53. Professor Kahana joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 2012 after spending several years at New York University; before that he taught at Bryn Mawr College after receiving his Ph.D. from Rutgers University. His arrival at UCSC came shortly after the launch of our Ph.D. program in the critical practice of film and digital media, a program on which he has had a profound and lasting effect. He was an accomplished scholar, teacher, and public intellectual, and we are bereft at the huge gap he leaves in our intellectual and personal lives and in the life of our department.&#160;<br/><br/>Professor Kahana was the author of <em>Intelligence Work: The Politics of American Documentary</em> (2008) and the editor of <em>The Documentary Film Reader: History, Theory, Criticism</em> (2016). The publication of <em>Intelligence Work</em> decisively established Professor Kahana as one of the most significant and innovative scholars in the field of U.S. documentary film. The book examined a range of documentary modes, from capital-intensive, widely-circulated works of state propaganda and mainstream film and television to the ephemeral, hand-made productions of radicals, artists, and amateurs. Kahana argued that all can be said to perform, in one way or another, &#8220;a similar intelligence work, by making visible the invisible or &#8216;phantom&#8217; realities that shape the experience of the ordinary Americans in whose name power is exercised and contested.&#8221; The book staged a vital dialogue between the fields of cinema and media studies and critical theory, grappling with enduring questions about the place and form of intellectual work and what constitutes public-ness.&#160;<br/><br/>Kahana&#8217;s edited volume <em>The Documentary Film Reader: History, Theory, Criticism</em> continued his contributions to documentary and its role in public life and is, by any measure, a monumental achievement. Clocking in at over 1,000 pages, the collection assembles both primary and secondary texts including essays, reviews, interviews, manifestos, letters, and ephemera from a huge range of sources. Professor Kahana not only rescued hard-to-find writings out of historical oblivion, but also shone a light on non-Euro-American writings and writings on avant-garde documentary practices, thereby powerfully reshuffling the field of documentary studies. In his general introduction, and in introducing each of the book&#8217;s seven sections, Professor Kahana situated his curated texts in their historical context and provided interpretive introductions that offer ways for readers to reflect on the history and evolution of documentary forms over the past hundred years. But this extraordinary collection was never intended just for critics or scholars--noted Canadian filmmaker John Greyson wrote a back-cover blurb for Kahana&#8217;s <em>Documentary Film Reader</em> that rhapsodised on the work and concluded, &#8220;Every aspiring filmmaker should keep a copy in her backpack.&#8221;&#160; &#160;</p>
<p>The recognition of Professor Kahana&#8217;s influence on students, scholars, and filmmakers alike is well noted. In his scholarship in and beyond these two books, Professor Kahana often formed deep intellectual dialogues with filmmakers and artists. His collaboration with multimedia artist Zoe Beloff led to two publications, an interview on Beloff&#8217;s staging of Brecht&#8217;s play <em>The Days of the Commune</em> and a small booklet with a dialogue on media activism in the contemporary moment. He published a conversation with filmmaker Liza Johnson on her film <em>South of Ten</em> and, with his partner Jennifer Horne, conducted an influential interview with famed documentary makers Harun Farocki and Jill Godmillow. Professor Kahana often brought filmmakers into dialogue with our students, too: UCSC&#8217;s Center for Documentary Arts and Research (CDAR), which he founded, fostered many enlightening exchanges between students, faculty, and artists. A regular at the annual Visible Evidence international documentary conferences, Professor Kahana directed the 2011 Visible Evidence conference in New York City, the year before he began teaching at UCSC. With three hundred participants present from twenty-five countries and a program of screenings, workshops, keynote talks and performances, and social events, Kahana was in his element, fostering debates, dialogues, and dinners.<br/><br/>Professor Kahana had a profound impact on the work of many of our graduate students, teaching core courses in the Ph.D. and M.F.A., as well as seminars on issues related to documentary. Here, he often connected his research to his seminars: for example, he offered a seminar on the documentary interview and another on the topic of re-enactment, the subject of the book he was working on at the time of his death. Even with his undergraduate courses, he managed to bring research questions to bear on our core curriculum, modeling for students the way to ask the most fundamental questions, including: &#8220;what is documentary?&#8221; His syllabi--undergraduate and graduate alike--show that he was never content to settle on teaching or investigating a topic; his skill was to model and enable modes of thinking, investigation, and scholarship. He advised a great many students in our programs, and his former advisees have gone on to tenure-track positions as professors while also earning international awards for their visual work. Even after moving to UCSC, he continued to chair the dissertations of former students at NYU, one of whom won the Society for Cinema and Media Studies Dissertation Award, the top dissertation prize in our field.&#160;<br/><br/>As his colleague, we saw these intellectual and pedagogical tendencies regularly in our interactions with him. Just as his scholarly writing is characterized by profound critical engagement and careful deliberation--the ability to enact <a href="https://tisch.nyu.edu/cinema-studies/news/remembering-jonathan-kahana?fbclid=IwAR3iG3cKXfX18TfqL2pW4MjgDBTIMm-8Jv1ZAQvaH8vU349NhwO4xeBONTw">what his friend and former colleague, Dana Polan, has termed &#8220;deep reflection and productive illumination&#8221;</a>--so too were his contributions to the life of the university. Never content to stop at the easy answer, Kahana would often pose the tough questions that many of us were too scared or reluctant to ask, sometimes in elaborate, perfect prose in lengthy, witty email messages that raised the bar on what that medium can do as a form; as other friends have pointed out in reflections after his death, one always had to bring one&#8217;s best game when corresponding with Jonathan. In such exchanges, Kahana exhibited a generosity of spirit and commitment to intellectual life both within the university and in its relations with diverse publics, which he often reached with his work.<br/><br/>For those of us lucky enough to enjoy Professor Kahana in social life beyond the department, we also mourn an emigr&#233; Canadian, new citizen, lover of cats, aficionado of good tea, swimmer, cyclist, fashionista, foodie, and sports fan. We also remember him as the devoted partner of our colleague, Professor Jennifer Horne, who asks that we consider donations in his memory to fund research on ALK+, the rare cancer that he fought since 2017. <a href="https://www.supportalcf.org/alk/researchforjonathan">https://www.supportalcf.org/alk/researchforjonathan</a>.<br/><br/>We hope to organize a memorial event in the department in the future and will post details when we can.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Department of Film and Digital Media</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ed038daf80727017465cacce7303cf36"><name>community-alert-seeking-assistance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community alert: Seeking assistance with burglaries, fraud, and thefts</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is seeking the communityâ€™s help in investigating a rash of crimes that began Jan. 8, 2020.</summary><start-date>1580112000000</start-date><display-name>Community alert: Seeking assistance with burglaries, fraud, and thefts</display-name><path>/2020/01/community-alert-seeking-assistance</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/01/community-alert-seeking-assistance</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1580229430671</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1580229430671</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div class="adn ads" data-legacy-message-id="16fea30c632c4f23" data-message-id="#msg-f:1656940986517704483">

<p>A program of the Leonardo International Society for Art, Science, and Technology (ISAST), the goal of the series is to feature compelling new developments in the arts and sciences, and to attract audiences that would not normally be found at the same event.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, February 19, the&#160;<a href="http://ias.ucsc.edu/"><em><strong>Institute of the Arts and Sciences</strong></em></a><span>&#160;</span>at UC Santa Cruz will bring its local LASER&#8212;now in its seventh year of quarterly talks on campus&#8212;downtown for a special evening at the Rio Theater in Santa Cruz, beginning at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>The event will include presentations by four UC Santa Cruz professors: biomolecular engineer<span>&#160;</span><strong>David Haussler</strong> <em>(</em><em>"The Challenge of Understanding Human Brain Evolution"</em><em>)</em>, award-winning author and literature professor <strong>Karen Tei Yamashita, </strong><em>(</em><em>"KonMarimasu"),&#160;</em>paleontologist and geochemist <strong>Paul Koch <em>(</em></strong><em>"Ancient human impacts on large animal communities"</em>), and anthropologist <strong>Nidhi Mahajan<span>&#160;</span></strong><em>(</em><em>"Silences and Specters of the Indian Ocean"</em><em>).</em></p>
<p>Admission is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>"Our next Leonardo Art/Science Evening Rendezvous at the Rio Theater in downtown Santa Cruz will give people a chance to hear from some outstanding faculty on campus,&#8221; said Jennifer Gonz&#225;lez, faculty co-director of UCSC&#8217;s Institute of the Arts and Sciences.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;From award-winning creative writing, to research into the human genome, the LASER talks offer a glimpse into the minds of creators and scientists on campus, attracting a diverse audience from across the disciplines. The goal of the talks is to inspire and inform the public about what nationally and internationally recognized faculty are exploring right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We like to hold at least one LASER talk per year at the Rio Theater to encourage a wider public to attend,&#8221; she added. &#8220;This is another opportunity for the community to connect with the university without having to make their way up to campus, and to draw together around critical issues and ideas of our current moment. This kind of event also offers the opportunity for non-specialists to be exposed to cutting edge research discoveries, remarkable creative talent and knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>The scientific director of the<span>&#160;</span>UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute, <strong>David Haussler</strong> is a pioneer in genomics research and an international leader in efforts to advance genomic medicine. Haussler&#8217;s team posted the first publicly available assembly of the human genome sequence online in 2000 and subsequently developed the UCSC Genome Browser, a widely used tool for biomedical researchers. His group&#8217;s work in cancer genomics includes collaborations with cancer researchers at medical centers nationally on efforts to discover molecular causes of cancer and pioneer a new personalized, genomics-based approach to cancer treatment.</p>

<p>As part of PG&amp;E's Higher Education Partnership Program, UC Santa Cruz replaced nearly all the lighting in the buildings with LED bulbs and also installed dimmers that respond to occupancy and the amount of daylight. The project will save more than 105,000 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity each year. UC Santa Cruz was awarded $16,384 from PG&amp;E to help fund the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;This project was highly successful because of the active collaboration of the Humanities staff, the PPDO facilities staff, and PG&amp;E engineers,&#8221; said Patrick Testoni, campus energy manager. &#8220;The project advances our sustainability and efficiency by reducing our energy footprint and maintenance needs, while also improving lighting quality.&#8221;</p>

Despite these efforts, we were disappointed that some of our TAs&#8212;200 of whom continue to withhold grades&#8212;last week threatened to escalate their activity to a full teaching strike. The threatened action violates the collective bargaining agreement that the University of California has with the TA&#8217;s union, the UAW. The collective bargaining agreement memorializes the rights of employees (here, the TAs and GSIs) and employers (here, the University of California). One of the central benefits bargained for by the University is the right to be free of any strikes during the term of the agreement. We expect our TAs who are union members to abide by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. &#160;<br/><br/></div>
<div>Nonetheless, in an effort to open up dialogue, we had two important meetings with graduate students this week. The first was a meeting at the UC system level between representatives from the Office of the President and the UAW Executive team who represent students across all campuses. That took place in Irvine on Wednesday. The second meeting occurred yesterday. I, along with Director of Employee &amp; Labor Relations Jennifer Schiffner, joined the Acting Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies Quentin Williams, and Graduate Student Association (GSA) co-presidents Yulia Gilichinskaya and Antony Boardman.<br/><br/></div>
<div>At the second meeting, we discussed collaborating towards building better support for all PhD and MFA students, not just union members. As part of this effort and to ensure productive conversation, we shared our willingness to pause employee disciplinary and student conduct processes for one week if graduate students paused all strike activities. These meetings are a positive step toward coming together as a community to face our shared challenges.<br/><br/></div>
<div>We certainly hope that these meetings mark the start of a new dynamic with our graduate students and a renewed sense of cooperation. Our graduate students play an important role in the educational mission of UCSC and we understand and empathize with the financial burden that results from the current housing crisis for many on our campus. It is only by working together that we can find solutions as a community.<br/><br/></div>
<div>However, if students decide to proceed with the threatened strike escalation they will violate the collective bargaining agreement that UC has with the UAW. In fact, the UAW notified the Academic Student Employees (ASEs) directly today that such strike activity is unauthorized and violates the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. As articulated in the agreement, participation in the strike will lead to consequences up to and including dismissal from employment.<br/><br/></div>
<div>This has been a challenging time for our community, especially our undergraduate students. I am hopeful we will find a path toward resolution and look forward to the opportunity to dialogue.<br/><br/></div>
<div>Sincerely,<br/><br/></div>
