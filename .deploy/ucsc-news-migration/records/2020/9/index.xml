of Washington, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and University of Chicago</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz will join three other institutions to establish a transdisciplinary research institute bringing together mathematicians, statisticians, and theoretical computer scientists to develop the theoretical foundations of the fast-growing field of data science.</p>
<p>Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Institute for Foundations of Data Science (IFDS) is a collaboration between the University of Washington, UC Santa Cruz, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and University of Chicago. Its mission is to develop a principled approach to the analysis of the ever-larger, more complex, and potentially biased data sets that play an increasingly important role in industry, government, and academia. The institute&#8217;s research will lead to methods that are more computationally efficient, robust to errors and incomplete or ambiguous data, and better able to respond and act in changing environments.</p>
<p>Support for the IFDS comes from a $12.5 million grant from the NSF&#8217;s Transdisciplinary Research in Principles of Data Science (TRIPODS) program. It is one of two institutes nationwide receiving the first TRIPODS Phase II awards, building on earlier Phase I efforts that began in 2017 at UC Santa Cruz and 11 other universities.</p>
<p>UCSC researchers led by Lise Getoor, professor of computer science and engineering in the <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a>, have been focused on developing a theory of data science applied to uncertain and heterogeneous graph and network data. In the new institute, they will be leveraging their successes in Phase I, with a new emphasis on the ethical and societal implications of data-driven algorithms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be sure that while we&#8217;re looking at optimization methods in data science, we connect that with issues of fairness, bias, and privacy,&#8221; said Getoor, who will be teaching her course on Ethics and Algorithms for the second time this fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any kind of algorithmic decision making can end up being biased with respect to race, gender, and so on,&#8221; she said. &#8220;One of our concerns is the issue of feedback loops by which these biased decisions get reinforced and can cascade in unanticipated and undesirable ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>Statistician Abel Rodriguez added that the data science community needs to do a better job of explaining how to interpret the output of machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p>&#8220;People need to be more skeptical. There is a tendency to interpret the output as indicating causality, when in fact the result is just an association that has nothing to do with the actual process you are investigating,&#8221; said Rodriguez, who will be based at the University of Washington while continuing his UCSC affiliation as a visiting professor and serving as the diversity liaison for the new institute.</p>
<p>Privacy is also a continuing challenge in data science. In 2018, UCSC received an NSF TRIPODS+X grant to investigate ways to protect the privacy of individuals while allowing access to large genomic data sets, a project led by Abhradeep Guha Thakurta, assistant professor of computer science and engineering.</p>
<p>The IFDS will build on strong collaborative relationships that already exist between the member institutions, Getoor said. The five-year funding plan for the institute includes $2.3 million for UC Santa Cruz. In addition to its research agenda, the institute will engage the data science community through workshops, summer schools, and hackathons.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, the IFDS will support education and outreach activities through the <a href="http://www.everettprogram.org/">Everett Program</a>, the <a href="https://publicphilosophy.ucsc.edu/">Center for Public Philosophy</a>, <a href="https://gwc.soe.ucsc.edu/">Girls Who Code</a>, and the local chapter of the <a href="https://women.acm.org/">Association for Computing Machinery - Women</a>. Planned activities include the Everett Program&#8217;s &#8220;impactathons&#8221; in support of local nonprofits and the Center for Public Philosophy&#8217;s Ethics Bowl programs.</p>
<p>In addition to Getoor and Rodriguez, the lead researchers at UC Santa Cruz include C. &#8220;Sesh&#8221; Seshadhri, associate professor of computer science and engineering, and Daniele Venturi, associate professor of applied mathematics. The TRIPODS effort at UCSC includes faculty in the Departments of Computer Science and Engineering, Statistics, and Applied Mathematics, and also has close ties with the <a href="https://d3.ucsc.edu/">D3 Data Science Research Center</a>.</p>
<p>TRIPODS is intimately connected to the NSF&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cise/harnessingdata/">Harnessing the Data Revolution (HDR)</a> program, which aims to accelerate discovery and innovation in data science algorithms, data cyberinfrastructure, and education and workforce development.</p>
<p>NSF Division Director for Mathematical Sciences Juan Meza said in a statement, &#8220;With NSF&#8217;s $25 million investment, these interdisciplinary teams will be able to tackle some of the most important theoretical and technical questions in data science.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/08/tripods-grant.html</url><title>NSF awards $1.5 million grant for data science research at UC Santa Cruz</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/09/tripods-grant.html</url><title>Data science researchers to tackle privacy challenges in genomics</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/announcements/090120.02.jsp</url><title>NSF Announcement</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4b594cf48072701763b3cba6f18de7d1"><name>upcoming-changes-to-zoom-meetings</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Upcoming Change to Zoom Meetings</title><summary>To further improve the security of Zoom meetings, Zoom will be making a change on Sept. 27 that requires all meetings to have a Passcode or a Waiting Room enabled.</summary><start-date>1598943600000</start-date><display-name>Upcoming Change to Zoom Meetings</display-name><path>/2020/09/upcoming-changes-to-zoom-meetings</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/09/upcoming-changes-to-zoom-meetings</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1598991977687</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1598991977687</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span>To further improve the security of Zoom meetings, Zoom will be making a change on Sept. 27 that requires all meetings to have a Passcode or a Waiting Room enabled.

musician, but the tragic 2018 Camp Fire prompted a change of heart and a leap into firefighting</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was November 2018, and professional musician Adam Lowdermilk (College Nine &#8217;09, economics/jazz minor) was in Sweden when he saw TV footage of flames from the infamous Camp Fire tearing through the town of Paradise, Calif.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lowdermilk&#8212;who grew up in San Diego where summer brush fires regularly blazed and who lived in Oakland near the Ghost Ship artists&#8217; collective, which burned down in 2016, killing 36 people&#8212;said he felt &#8220;an almost visceral pull&#8221; to help those in the path of an inferno that would go on to leave 85 people dead and more than 18,000 structures destroyed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem was, he had no experience or training in firefighting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward to today, and Lowdermilk&#8217;s life of recording studios and late-night gigs has been replaced by firehouses and early-morning medical-aid calls. Two months ago, he was hired as a firefighter by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) and assigned to a stationhouse in Sutter Creek near Sacramento, where he is now poised to battle some of the worst fires ever to hit California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seemed like fire was always encroaching in my life, and it was becoming a bigger problem in the state,&#8221; said the 33-year-old Lowdermilk, who is also a backpacker, climber, and surfer. Becoming a firefighter &#8220;was a combination of wanting to help others and to preserve wildlife and nature for others and for future generations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lowdermilk fell in love with music as a child. He first played violin and piano and then picked up the electric bass in high school. Soon, he was playing in punk rock bands and stepping into the jazz world. At UC Santa Cruz, Lowdermilk&#8217;s passion for jazz grew. Mentored by Music Lecturer Stan Poplin, Lowdermilk played in the campus jazz and big bands and in small combos. He went on to get an MFA in music performance from Mills College.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was a formative time. It solidified my love for jazz,&#8221; Lowdermilk said of his time at UC Santa Cruz. For 12 years, he made a good living playing music: jazz, funk, Afro-Cuban, and West African styles with various bands and music luminaries in the Bay Area, including jazz great Roscoe Mitchell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Camp Fire changed his path.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as he returned home from Sweden, Lowdermilk said, he signed up for an EMT and fire science courses at Merritt College. Later, he was accepted into Chabot College&#8217;s firefighter academy, which was six months of six-days-a-week training. On his one day off, he worked as an EMT for an ambulance company to get more experience. A month after he completed his training, Cal Fire hired him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many might not see a connection between music and firefighting, Lowdermilk does.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is so much of being a creative person that is transferable to fire service,&#8221; he said by phone during a recent lunch break at the fire station. &#8220;There are so many things you face on a daily basis that are unpredictable and require creative solutions and being able to think quickly. The element of improvisation in music translates well into my work now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lowdermilk said he hadn&#8217;t yet been rotated onto any of the fire lines for California&#8217;s mega blazes but remained at the station to handle everyday calls from vegetation and structure fires to vehicle fires, traffic collisions, and medical emergencies. That situation could change at any moment, however.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You have to be flexible from day to day,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lowdermilk still plays music&#8212;mostly at home&#8212;but he knows he made the right decision to switch careers. Recently, he was awakened in the middle of the night to respond to a brush fire that was threatening nearby structures. As he and his fellow firefighters were setting up hose lines to the blaze, he slid down a steep embankment and found himself in the middle of chest-high flames and billowing smoke.&#160;</span></p>

Butler&#8217;s response was to send a tweet: &#8220;I would be down as a professor to follow the NBA and Strike for a few days to protest police violence in America.&#8221; And so #ScholarStrike was born.</p>
<p>Butler was soon joined by a co-organizer, Kevin Gannon, director of the Center for Teaching and Learning at Grandview University, who volunteered to do whatever he could to support her efforts. The two of them sent out a call for the entire higher education community to participate in a two-day action on Sept. 8 and 9, 2020. Over the course of these two days, they are inviting academics to take action in the struggle for racial justice and against police violence against Black Americans. As Butler put it in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Scholarstrike2020/">Facebook live post</a>, #ScholarStrike is an opportunity for us as academics to &#8220;be teachers&#8221; and to &#8220;contribute something,&#8221; to use our skills as educators, practitioners, and advocates in the service of antiracism.</p>
<p>Butler and Gannon have invited colleagues around the country to bring their expertise in any disciplinary field to contribute 10-minute videos that will be screened on a ScholarStrike YouTube channel throughout the two days to raise awareness about policing, police violence, mass incarceration, anti-Black racism, and the struggle for racial justice. A <a href="http://scholarstrike.com/">website is providing information</a> about campus-specific actions taking place around the country and even around the world.</p>
<p>For those who don&#8217;t feel equipped or able to produce short videos, they recommend a range of other possible forms of action for academics and educators: if you&#8217;re a professor, take a picture of your class learning about an issue related to racial justice and post it to Twitter using the hashtag @ScholarStrike or add it to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Scholarstrike2020/">their Facebook page</a>; if you&#8217;re a publisher, promote the books in your list that deal directly with anti-Black racism or the history of Civil Rights; if you&#8217;re an artist, create something that contributes to antiracist movements and share it on the platform of your choice.</p>
<p>For those who can, they have suggested that instructors don&#8217;t teach and that administrators don&#8217;t conduct business as usual. Yet Butler is careful not to be prescriptive about what it means to &#8220;take action.&#8221; Faculty members at UCSC are not teaching right now, for instance, and many contingent faculty members around the country might not feel protected to withdraw their labor by not teaching. Butler&#8217;s response is to insist that action can take many forms, and that the point is not so much to withdraw our labor as to &#8220;take time out to engage in actions&#8221; that contribute meaningfully to antiracist practice.</p>
<p>At UCSC, numerous staff and faculty members have devoted time and attention this summer to antiracist practice and education. Recognizing the importance of cross-divisional, cross-disciplinary work, staff and faculty have participated in discussions to identify action plans that co-create antiracist learning and working climates. Throughout the summer, several divisions and offices have participated in reading groups. The books on reading lists include <em>How to be Antiracist</em> by Ibram Kendi, <em>White Fragility</em> by Robin DiAngelo, and <em>From Equity Talk to Equity Walk</em>, by Tia Brown McNair, Estela Maria Bensimon, and Lindsey Malcolm-Piqueux. Diversity committees across campus have been meeting to identify action plans with diversity initiatives that include educational and professional development opportunities for faculty and staff, as well as continued commitment to diversifying faculty on campus with a goal for co-creating climates that encourage retention&#8212;for students, faculty and staff.</p>
<p>What is exceptional about the work being spearheaded by the UCSC Banana Slug community is the recognition that this work needs to extend beyond two days or even a summer, and needs to be ongoing, ever-improving, so that we can meaningfully heed the call of our undergraduate and graduate students, as well as our faculty and staff, to be antiracist, dismantle antiblackness, and continue active practices of inclusion so that our BIPOC (Black Indigenous People of Color) communities can be successful and thrive at UCSC. Units from across the campus are partnering to develop educational and professional development opportunities throughout the 2020-2021 academic year. Topics will include: developing antiracist curriculum and pedagogical practices, facilitating classroom discussions about race and racism and antiblackness, strategies for self-care, inclusive communication skills in classroom and workplace spaces, addressing microaggressions, and more. Some departments have also contracted with external facilitators this coming year to continue in-depth work that they started during the summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am committed to this antiracist work on an ongoing basis, embedded in everything we do at UCSC,&#8221; says Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer. &#8220;As a public research university and member of AAU, UCSC must work against the tradition and practice of higher education in replicating white privilege. If we do not embrace this work and commit ourselves to it, we cannot claim to be a route to economic and social mobility.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6e9966958072701763b3cba61d541485"><name>climate-variability</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>High-fidelity record of Earth’s climate history puts current changes in context</title><summary>A continuous record of the past 66 million years shows natural climate variability due to changes in Earth’s orbit around the sun is much smaller than projected future warming due to greenhouse gas emissions.</summary><keywords>James Zachos</keywords><start-date>1599760800000</start-date><display-name>High-fidelity record of Earth’s climate history puts current changes in context</display-name><path>/2020/09/climate-variability</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/09/climate-variability</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1599583381114</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1599761038633</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/09/images/climate-states-800.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/09/images/climate-states-800.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>climate-states-800.jpg</name><display-name>climate-states-800.jpg</display-name><file-size>168179</file-size><width>800</width><height>340</height></image><image-alt>Graph showing trends in global temperatures</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/09/images/climate-states-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/09/images/climate-states-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>climate-states-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>climate-states-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18438</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Graph of global temperatures</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Past and future trends in global mean temperature spanning the last 66 million years, showing four distinctive climate states. <strong><a href="images/climate-states-lg-cap.jpg">See larger image</a></strong> (Credit: Westerhold et al., CENOGRID)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/jim-zachos-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/jim-zachos-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jim-zachos-350.jpg</name><display-name>jim-zachos-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>105539</file-size><width>350</width><height>382</height></image><image-alt>James Zachos</image-alt><image-caption>James Zachos</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>A continuous record of the past 66 million years shows natural climate variability due to changes in Earth’s orbit around the sun is much smaller than projected future warming due to greenhouse gas emissions</article-subhead><article-text><p>For the first time, climate scientists have compiled a continuous, high-fidelity record of variations in Earth&#8217;s climate extending 66 million years into the past. The record reveals four distinctive climate states, which the researchers dubbed Hothouse, Warmhouse, Coolhouse, and Icehouse.</p>
<p>These major climate states persisted for millions and sometimes tens of millions of years, and within each one the climate shows rhythmic variations corresponding to changes in Earth&#8217;s orbit around the sun. But each climate state has a distinctive response to orbital variations, which drive relatively small changes in global temperatures compared with the dramatic shifts between different climate states.</p>
<p>The new findings, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6509/1383">published September 10 in <em>Science</em></a>, are the result of decades of work and a large international collaboration. The challenge was to determine past climate variations on a time scale fine enough to see the variability attributable to orbital variations (in the eccentricity of Earth&#8217;s orbit around the sun and the precession and tilt of its rotational axis).</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve known for a long time that the glacial-interglacial cycles are paced by changes in Earth&#8217;s orbit, which alter the amount of solar energy reaching Earth&#8217;s surface, and astronomers have been computing these orbital variations back in time,&#8221; explained coauthor James Zachos, distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences and Ida Benson Lynn Professor of Ocean Health at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we reconstructed past climates, we could see long-term coarse changes quite well. We also knew there should be finer-scale rhythmic variability due to orbital variations, but for a long time it was considered impossible to recover that signal,&#8221; Zachos said. &#8220;Now that we have succeeded in capturing the natural climate variability, we can see that the projected anthropogenic warming will be much greater than that.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Icehouse</strong></p>
<p>For the past 3 million years, Earth&#8217;s climate has been in an Icehouse state characterized by alternating glacial and interglacial periods. Modern humans evolved during this time, but greenhouse gas emissions and other human activities are now driving the planet toward the Warmhouse and Hothouse climate states not seen since the Eocene epoch, which ended about 34 million years ago. During the early Eocene, there were no polar ice caps, and average global temperatures were 9 to 14 degrees Celsius higher than today.</p>
<p>&#8220;The IPCC projections for 2300 in the &#8216;business-as-usual&#8217; scenario will potentially bring global temperature to a level the planet has not seen in 50 million years,&#8221; Zachos said.</p>
<p>Critical to compiling the new climate record was getting high-quality sediment cores from deep ocean basins through the international Ocean Drilling Program (ODP, later the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program, IODP, succeeded in 2013 by the International Ocean Discovery Program). Signatures of past climates are recorded in the shells of microscopic plankton (called foraminifera) preserved in the seafloor sediments. After analyzing the sediment cores, researchers then had to develop an &#8220;astrochronology&#8221; by matching the climate variations recorded in sediment layers with variations in Earth&#8217;s orbit (known as Milankovitch cycles).</p>
<p>&#8220;The community figured out how to extend this strategy to older time intervals in the mid-1990s,&#8221; said Zachos, who led a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/292/5515/274">study published in 2001 in <em>Science</em></a> that showed the climate response to orbital variations for a 5-million-year period covering the transition from the Oligocene epoch to the Miocene, about 25 million years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;That changed everything, because if we could do that, we knew we could go all the way back to maybe 66 million years ago and put these transient events and major transitions in Earth&#8217;s climate in the context of orbital-scale variations,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><strong>Sediment cores</strong></p>
<p>Zachos has collaborated for years with lead author Thomas Westerhold at the University of Bremen Center for Marine Environmental Sciences (MARUM) in Germany, which houses a vast repository of sediment cores. The Bremen lab along with Zachos&#8217;s group at UCSC generated much of the new data for the older part of the record.</p>
<p>Westerhold oversaw a critical step, splicing together overlapping segments of the climate record obtained from sediment cores from different parts of the world. &#8220;It&#8217;s a tedious process to assemble this long megasplice of climate records, and we also wanted to replicate the records with separate sediment cores to verify the signals, so this was a big effort of the international community working together,&#8221; Zachos said.</p>
<p>Now that they have compiled a continuous, astronomically dated climate record of the past 66 million years, the researchers can see that the climate&#8217;s response to orbital variations depends on factors such as greenhouse gas levels and the extent of polar ice sheets.</p>
<p>&#8220;In an extreme greenhouse world with no ice, there won&#8217;t be any feedbacks involving the ice sheets, and that changes the dynamics of the climate,&#8221; Zachos explained.</p>
<p><strong>Greenhouse gas levels</strong></p>
<p>Most of the major climate transitions in the past 66 million years have been associated with changes in greenhouse gas levels. Zachos has done extensive research on the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), for example, showing that this episode of rapid global warming, which drove the climate into a Hothouse state, was associated with a massive release of carbon into the atmosphere. Similarly, in the late Eocene, as atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were dropping, ice sheets began to form in Antarctica and the climate transitioned to a Coolhouse state.</p>
<p>&#8220;The climate can become unstable when it&#8217;s nearing one of these transitions, and we see more deterministic responses to orbital forcing, so that&#8217;s something we would like to better understand,&#8221; Zachos said.</p>
<p>The new climate record provides a valuable framework for many areas of research, he added. It is not only useful for testing climate models, but also for geophysicists studying different aspects of Earth dynamics and paleontologists studying how changing environments drive the evolution of species.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a significant advance in Earth science, and a major legacy of the international Ocean Drilling Program,&#8221; Zachos said.</p>
<p>Coauthors Steven Bohaty, now at the University of Southampton, and Kate Littler, now at the University of Exeter, both worked with Zachos at UC Santa Cruz. The paper&#8217;s coauthors also include researchers at more than a dozen institutions around the world. This work was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG), Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC), European Union&#8217;s Horizon 2020 program, National Science Foundation of China, Netherlands Earth System Science Centre, and the U.S. National Science Foundation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2008/02/1957.html</url><title>Past greenhouse warming events provide clues to what the future may hold</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6eb7df448072701763b3cba670e2b8b2"><name>principles-successes</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Year in Review: Campus successes tied to Principles of Community </title><summary>While adapting to a global pandemic and responding to a massive wildfire, UC Santa Cruz has achieved some historic success. </summary><start-date>1599548400000</start-date><display-name>Year in Review</display-name><path>/2020/09/principles-successes</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/09/principles-successes</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1599585378078</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1599852494079</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/09/images/stars-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/09/images/stars-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stars-500px.jpg</name><display-name>stars-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>137537</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/09/images/stars-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/09/images/stars-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stars-80px.jpg</name><display-name>stars-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>14231</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The past year's successes underscore the important role public research universities play in our world and set the stage for even greater accomplishments in the academic year ahead.

Purposeful. Caring. Just. Disciplined. Celebrative. The seven campus Principles of Community are at the heart of UC Santa Cruz and all that faculty, staff, and students accomplished this past academic year&#8212;despite the incredible challenges faced by campus.</p>
<p>While adapting to a global pandemic and responding to a massive wildfire, UC Santa Cruz has achieved some historic success. The accomplishments below represent only a fraction of what faculty, staff, and students have done together since last fall. They underscore the important role public research universities play in our world and set the stage for even greater accomplishments in the academic year ahead.</p>
<h1><strong>Diverse:</strong> Creating social mobility for students from all backgrounds</h1>
<p>UC Santa Cruz debuted last fall as the second best university in the country for social mobility, according to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-california-santa-cruz-1321/overall-rankings">the 2020 U.S. News and World Report rankings</a>.</p>
<p>The first-ever social mobility list measures graduation rates for students who received federal Pell Grants, which are typically awarded to students who come from households that earn less than $50,000 annually. UC Santa Cruz students deserve this accolade for their resilience and hard work, and every UC Santa Cruz employee contributes to student success.</p>
<p>While there is much to do to ensure equity in graduation rates and fulfill the promise of access to higher education, for this fall, the campus admitted a cohort of students that reflects excellence and diversity. Nearly a third of admitted first-year students earned a GPA above 4.13 and 55 percent earned a GPA between 3.6 and 4.12. UC Santa Cruz also significantly increased the number of students admitted from low-income families, underrepresented groups, and those who will be the first in their family to earn a four-year degree.</p>
<p>The University of California is an <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/climb-mobility-analysis">equalizer for students</a> from low-income families. UC alumni go on to earn as much as students who came from middle-income families, and their earnings double by a decade after graduation.</p>
<h1><strong>Open:</strong> Faculty share insights to inspire change</h1>
<p><img alt="falcon-400.jpg" class="" height="251" src="images/falcon-400.jpg" style="margin: 5px 10px; float: left;" width="225"/>Nine UCSC affiliates delivered stirring talks on the &#8220;Art of Hope&#8221; for TEDx Santa Cruz meant to inspire those in the audience to action.</p>
<p>Delivered just before a pandemic swept across the world, the talks are a strong antidote for these difficult times. Many of the <a href="http://www.tedxsantacruz.org/talks/">talks are online</a>, including &#8220;The Ingredients of Activism,&#8221; by Sylvanna Falc&#243;n, professor of Latin American and Latino studies; &#8220;The Philosophy of Hope and Despair,&#8221; by Kyle Robertson, co-founder of the Center for Public Philosophy; and &#8220;The Radical Authenticity Revolution,&#8221; by Phillip Hammack, professor of psychology.</p>
<p>Nada Miljkovic, the lead organizer of TEDx Santa Cruz, is also an alumna (MFA &#8217;09, digital arts and new media) and an instructor on campus.</p>
<h1><strong>Purposeful</strong>: Pivoting to remote instruction for community health, wellbeing</h1>
<p>The pandemic created by COVID&#8211;19 required UC Santa Cruz and universities across the country to rapidly shift from in-person learning to remote instruction.</p>
<p>The shift happened with stunning speed. Chancellor Cynthia Larive announced on March 10 that in-person instruction would be suspended and encouraged students living on campus to return to their permanent residence, if possible. Three days later, the chancellor announced that the spring quarter would be held with remote instruction.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/03/greene-remote.html">Committed to supporting students</a>, faculty and staff did what might otherwise seem impossible. Never before have Banana Slugs needed to move so fast.</p>
<h1><strong>Caring:</strong> Opening a COVID&#8211;19 testing lab to support our communities</h1>
<p>As COVID&#8211;19 began to spread across the state, UC Santa Cruz researchers did what they always do&#8212;figure out how to help.</p>
<p>With expertise in RNA, molecular biology, virology, and vaccine development, campus researchers quickly realized they could establish a lab to provide diagnostic COVID&#8211;19 testing to the local community.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="" height="284" src="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/08/images/covid-lab-12-4001.jpg" style="float: right;" width="400"/>Creating this new lab&#8212;which is running about 700 tests every week for community partners&#8212;is another of a long campus history of partnering with local government and community organizations to serve our area.</p>
<p>The lab continues to expand its capacity with plans to increase capacity to 600&#8211;800 tests per day, thanks to new equipment purchased by Santa Cruz County with funding from the CARES Act.</p>
<p>This fall, UC Santa Cruz will start asymptomatic testing for members of the UCSC community who plan to attend class, live on or work on UCSC sites during the fall quarter. This will be done through pool testing, in which many swabs are tested together.</p>
<p>This program will support not only the health and well-being of those who are on campus but those who are in our local community. <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/08/campus-county-partnership.html">Read more</a>.</p>
<h1><strong>Just:</strong> Strengthening the commitment to diversity, inclusion, equity</h1>
<p>The campus commitment to diversity, inclusion, equity, and equal protection starts at the top.</p>
<p>On her first day on the job, Chancellor Cynthia Larive announced that she was elevating Teresa Maria Linda Scholz to oversee the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and having her report to the chancellor. Scholz, the Associate Vice Chancellor and Campus Diversity Officer, works collaboratively with others throughout UC Santa Cruz to promote a campus climate that values diversity, equity and inclusion, and is free of bias and harassment.</p>
<p>In March, Larive announced the creation of the Equity and Equal Protection Office in March, which has streamlined processes for students, staff and faculty to report a complaint or grievance. The campus community has one place to go for complaints related to harassment and discrimination. <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/03/eep-announcement.html">Read more</a>.</p>
<h1><strong>Disciplined:</strong> Strength in research, education opens door to leading higher education association</h1>
<p>The University of California, Santa Cruz, has joined the Association of American Universities, an achievement that underscores the impact and quality of the campus&#8217;s research and graduate and undergraduate education. Membership in the AAU provides UC Santa Cruz greater opportunity to shape and advocate for the future of higher education.</p>
<p>The association, founded in 1900, has 65 members, including six other UCs, flagship public universities such as Ohio State University, land-grant universities like Purdue University, and private institutions, such as Harvard. This is the first time the association has invited new members since 2012.</p>
<p>In deciding whether to invite a university to join, the association evaluates a range of indicators, such as research funding, faculty awards and honors, citations, doctoral education, undergraduate education and more. Dartmouth College and the University of Utah are being welcomed to the AAU along with UC Santa Cruz. <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/11/aau.html">Read more</a>.</p>
<h1><strong>Celebrative:</strong> Honoring the strength and perseverance of new alumni</h1>
<p>For the first time in the campus&#8217;s history, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s commencement festivities beamed their way through computer and smartphone screens, instead of taking place in real time on a field, a lawn, or the historic Quarry Amphitheater.</p>
<p><img alt="padilla-grad-shoot-400px.jpg" height="267" src="images/padilla-grad-shoot-400px.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 4px 10px;" width="400"/>In spite of the virtual ceremonies, there were still plenty of moving moments that were bound to get the tear ducts flowing&#8212;such as the time when one speaker said &#8220;You are your ancestors&#8217; wildest dreams. You will continue their legacy by opening doors and bringing many more with you to this point and beyond.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those were the moments that kept the ceremonies real and grounded, even when the well-wishers were far away from one another.</p>
<p>Faculty and students kept repeating a powerful and simple message to the roughly 3,300 undergraduates and 208 graduate students who had applied to graduate this spring: this is a landmark moment in your lifetime. <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/06/commencement-coverage-2020.html">Read more</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6eda804f8072701763b3cba614c2764a"><name>kelp-forests</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Cooperative research effort documents northward migration of kelp forests</title><summary>From Alaska to Mexico, warming waters are driving widespread changes in these highly productive coastal ecosystems.</summary><keywords>Mark Carr</keywords><start-date>1599663600000</start-date><display-name>Cooperative research effort documents northward migration of kelp forests</display-name><path>/2020/09/kelp-forests</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/09/kelp-forests</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1599587647543</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1599664647959</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens &amp; Sarah Buckleitner</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/09/images/diver-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/09/images/diver-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>diver-450.jpg</name><display-name>diver-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>91598</file-size><width>450</width><height>338</height></image><image-alt>diver in kelp forest</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/09/images/diver-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/09/images/diver-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>diver-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>diver-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16561</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>diver in kelp forest</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Volunteer divers collected data in kelp forests from Alaska to Baja California.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/09/images/kelp-forest-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/09/images/kelp-forest-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kelp-forest-400.jpg</name><display-name>kelp-forest-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>71051</file-size><width>400</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>fish in kelp forest</image-alt><image-caption>Kelp forests are among the most productive and species-rich marine ecosystems in the world.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>From Alaska to Mexico, warming waters are driving widespread changes in these highly productive coastal ecosystems</article-subhead><article-text><p>In a sweeping display of the power of community-based science to capture data spanning the entire West Coast of North America, a team of scientists and countless volunteers from 14 different organizations joined forces to document the northward migration of kelp forests due to warming waters.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a rare instance when so many have collaborated from Alaska to Mexico to describe how kelp forest ecosystems are being influenced by climate change and how differences among regions of the coast can help us identify where communities and fisheries are most likely to be impacted,&#8221; said Mark Carr, professor and chair of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Carr is a coauthor of the study, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.15273">published September 9 in <em>Global Change Biology</em></a>. Participating partners include the University of Alaska, UC Santa Cruz, Reef Check California, Stanford University, San Diego State University, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, NOAA, and Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in the United States, and Comunidad y Biodiversidad A.C., Universidad Aut&#243;noma de Baja California, and fishing communities in Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>Productive ecosystems</strong></p>
<p>Kelp forests are among the most productive and species-rich marine ecosystems in the world. Canopy-forming kelps declined in abundance across the entire study region, but declines were highest in the southernmost portion of the range and in the Northern California ecoregion. Temperate kelp forest ecosystems appear especially vulnerable to marine heatwaves such as the anomalous &#8220;warm blob&#8221; that appeared in 2014-16.</p>
<p>The results suggest that coastal communities that are dependent on kelp forests will be more impacted in the southern portion of the California Current region, highlighting the urgency of implementing adaptive strategies to sustain livelihoods and ensure food security. The study also highlights the importance of monitoring programs that span an entire ecosystem's range.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks to a standard monitoring program that spans oceans, years, and many collaborative efforts, we could look at an entire system and gain unique insights. If we had studied just individual areas, we never would&#8217;ve been able to draw the same conclusions about how kelp forests are changing,&#8221; said senior author Brock Woodson of the University of Georgia.</p>
<p>The researchers hope that this project can serve as a model for how to harness the power of cooperation and volunteer-driven data.</p>
<p><strong>PISCO</strong></p>
<p>The project owes much of its success to the Partnership for the Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO), a collaboration involving UC Santa Cruz and other universities, which developed the initial monitoring program in California and Oregon in 1999. Reef Check of California, Comunidad y Biodiversidad, and MexCal expanded the PISCO monitoring protocols through citizen science programs. By using similar monitoring guidelines across different programs and groups, the project was able to compare their results to develop a picture of what was happening to kelp forests in different regions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It shows the critical value of large-scale, long-term monitoring studies, like the PISCO program here at UCSC and collaborating universities, for providing this information for academics, managers, and policy makers,&#8221; Carr said.</p>
<p>Each region had a different type of volunteer divers collecting the information&#8212;from undergraduate students and tourist divers in California to women from fishing communities at Isla Natividad in Mexico, known as &#8220;Las Sirenas del Mar,&#8221; who were trained as divers and have been active participants in the underwater community-based monitoring program.</p>
<p>The volunteers across programs used &#8220;belt transects,&#8221; a method used to measure distances underwater and visually collect data about the numbers of fish, macroinvertebrates, sponges, algae, and kelp species spotted while diving within the kelp forests.</p>
<p>The changes they helped document could wreak ecological and economic havoc on the communities&#8212;both marine and human&#8212;that depend on the kelp to survive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think about what would happen if you took the trees out of a forest: it&#8217;d be a meadow. There might still be life there, but it wouldn&#8217;t look anything like the ecosystem that lived in the forest. Kelp are the trees of the oceanic forest,&#8221; Woodson explained.</p>
<p>Lead author Rodrigo Beas from Universidad Aut&#243;noma de Baja California, said kelp forests are as complex and productive as tropical rain forests. &#8220;It&#8217;s an incredible world down there,&#8221; Beas said. &#8220;Like being in a forest, except that you&#8217;re able to fly up into the canopy to see all the life happening at different levels among the trees. Sometimes it can get very dark and moody. It&#8217;s beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Ocean-wide trend</strong></p>
<p>By analyzing the data from each separate group and area as a whole, the researchers were able to clearly see an ocean-wide trend: edges of the distribution are more sensitive and kelp is migrating northward. But the researchers also noticed that as the kelp migrates, only the species that eat it directly appear to migrate with it. This leaves a broken food web behind.</p>
<p>Senior author Fiorenza Micheli at Stanford University stressed the need to ramp up action. &#8220;We documented major, region-wide changes in these productive coastal ecosystems in response to recent heat waves,&#8221; Micheli said. &#8220;Impacts are greatest in the northern and southern portions of this region, highlighting the urgency of protecting these vital ecosystems, sustaining livelihoods, and ensuring food security for coastal communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coauthor Jorge Torre at Comunidad y Biodiversidad in Mexico added, &#8220;This is an excellent example of collaboration between researchers, communities, and civil society organizations in the United States and Mexico to understand how climate change will impact the kelp forest and therefore fisheries in coastal communities for the next 30 years. This can help us to start making the needed changes so the coastal communities can adapt and maintain ecosystem resilience.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6fc5da088072701763b3cba610208297"><name>election-series</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Election series looks at critical moment in time</title><summary>The four-part series will address how social movements on the left and right have shaped what is at stake in the election, what institutional barriers to democracy exist in America’s political system, and how patterns of civic engagement are influencing the election.</summary><start-date>1599548400000</start-date><display-name>Election series</display-name><path>/2020/09/election-series</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/09/election-series</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1599603071468</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1599773350617</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Lisa Renner</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/09/images/election-series-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/09/images/election-series-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>election-series-500px.jpg</name><display-name>election-series-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>64544</file-size><width>500</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Ballot box</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/09/images/election-series-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/09/images/election-series-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>election-series-80px.jpg</name><display-name>election-series-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>13705</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Ballot box</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>With the presidential election less than two months away, UC Santa Cruz faculty members, in conversation with policy advocates and community organizers, plan to provide insights into the critical issues facing our time and how we arrived to this point.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz Institute for Social Transformation and University Forum are organizing a free online series of conversations on the topic <a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/election-series/">&#8220;Elections: What are They Good For?&#8221;</a> beginning Sept. 15. The four-part series, subtitled &#8220;Democracy, Dilemmas and Decisions,&#8221; will address how social movements on the left and right have shaped what is at stake in the election, what institutional barriers to democracy exist in America&#8217;s political system, and how patterns of civic engagement are influencing the election.</p>
<p>Those who watch the talks should expect a facilitated conversation on the issues, rather than speakers giving presentations, said Chris Benner, the moderator of the event and the director of the Institute for Social Transformation.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we want to do in this series is step back a bit and put the elections in a bigger context,&#8221; Benner said.</p>
<p>The talks will be shown over Zoom, which Benner hopes will give viewers a feeling of closeness and connection to the speakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not sitting in the back of an auditorium,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our goal is to make it intimate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The discussions are scheduled 5:30&#8211;7pm. Sept. 15, Sept. 23, Oct. 5, and Oct. 19. The first two sessions will focus on national issues while the last two will center on California. Read on to learn about each talk:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sept. 15-&#8220;Hope, Fear and Desire for Democracy on the Eve of an Election.&#8221;</strong> This session will examine how broader democratic energies and social movements have shaped this election. Discussion topics will include the social reaction to the first black President and how it led to mobilization of conservative white supremacists, the Tea Party and finally the Trump phenomena. There will also be discussion of the Black Lives Matter movement, Latino political movements, and the influence of shifting demographics on the election process. Featuring Dean Mathiowetz, UC Santa Cruz associate professor of politics; Deborah Gould, UC Santa Cruz associate professor of sociology and Cristina Beltr&#225;n (Porter &#8217;92), associate professor at New York University.</li>
<li><strong>Sept. 23- &#8220;Elections, the Constitution, and Institutional Reform."</strong> This session focuses on the institutional constraints on democratic voice, and related efforts to expand political participation. Expect to hear about efforts to limit gerrymandering, the movement to have Electoral College votes reflect the popular vote, proposals to limit Supreme Court justice terms, and how adding new U.S. states like Puerto Rico or Washington, D.C. would impact the Senate. Featuring Daniel Wirls, UC Santa Cruz professor of politics and Kathay Feng, national redistricting director of Common Cause, an organization fighting for accountable government, equal rights and opportunities for all.</li>
<li><strong>Oct. 5&#8212;&#8220;California: Changing Demographics, Youth and Integrated Voter Engagement.&#8221;</strong> This discussion will focus on Latino and youth voters and how community organizations and nonprofits are working to increase voter turnout in their areas. Featuring Veronica Terriquez, UC Santa Cruz associate professor of sociology; Randy Villegas, UC Santa Cruz Ph.D. candidate and Martin Higuera, community activist.</li>
<li><strong>Oct. 19&#8212;&#8220;California: Our Criminal Justice System and Political Possibilities.&#8221;</strong> Panel participants will examine the &#8220;defund the police movement&#8221; in the context of broader movements to deinstitutionalize people who have been convicted of crimes in California. The discussion will also cover three related Voter-initiated Propositions on the November 2020 ballot: Prop 17 which would restore right to vote for people convicted of felonies who are on parole; Prop 20 which restricts parole for nonviolent offenders; and Prop 25, a referendum to overturn a 2018 law that replaced money bail system with a system based on public safety. Featuring Craig Haney, UC Santa Cruz professor of psychology and Anjuli Verma, UC Santa Cruz assistant professor of politics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Benner said he hopes those who attend the talks will come away more thoughtful, more educated, more aware of the importance of civic engagement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it helps motivate people to get involved,&#8221; he said, &#8220;One- to vote, but two, to recognize that voting is only one of the many ways that we need to be engaged to strengthen and improve our democracy.&#8221;</p>

Individuals from units across campus worked to facilitate evacuations, set up evacuation and emergency housing sites, and support those who were impacted by the fire.. This all took place in the midst of a pandemic. Generosity, teamwork, and compassion were hallmarks throughout.</span></span></p>

This policy serves as the foundation for these community expectations. When community members are not willing to align with the standards outlined in the policy, consequences up to and including possible loss of access to the campus, employment impacts or impacts to student status may result.&#160;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">We ask all members of the UCSC community to:</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite huge hurdles to overcome, the university was able to bring more than 350 classes to remote learning this summer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I am immeasurably proud of summer instructor innovation and adaptability&#8212;launching this unique summer, unprecedented in size and strain,&#8221; said Monica Parikh, summer session director. &#8220;Our new and continuing Slugs made much-needed degree progress."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz staff and faculty have been steadily working to increase summer session enrollment, leading UCs in online offerings and working with departments to offer the classes students need to graduate.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driven in part by the switch to all-remote classes, 7,816 students took 78,942 credits&#8212;a major increase from 2013, when 4,717 students took 32,488 credits.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This continued growth of Summer Session is particularly sweet for Parikh, who was tasked with doubling its enrollment when she was hired in 2012. Parikh said she&#8217;s just happy that students were able to get the classes they needed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Madi Strohauer, a senior and lead mentor in the Summer Edge program for first-year and transfer students, said she was nervous about attending online classes at first, but had a good experience. She appreciated being in the comfort of her home and avoiding a commute.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said online classes do require self-motivation and self-discipline. It&#8217;s easy to get distracted when you&#8217;re tuning into a Zoom class with your camera turned off.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marisa Dobkins, who is close to finishing her degree, said she appreciated being able to take the summer online courses while living at home in San Jose. She enjoys the flexibility of not having to be tied to a certain time or place.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Really, I&#8217;ve been doing a large portion of classes online for years and years and it is working,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she said she preferred her synchronous classes to those asynchronous because of the community support. She liked connecting with the students and seeing her proctors. With her asynchronous classes, she had less face-to-face communication with the instructors.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While making the switch to online teaching was tough for some faculty, they rose to the challenge.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parikh highlights the example of Organic Chemistry 2 instructor Gabriella Amberchan. Going remote this summer allowed her to add more space to her popular class. She was able to accommodate double the students in this graduation- and medical school-required course- and a lab science class at that. Parikh emphasizes this was a huge accomplishment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To accomplish the lab requirement, Amberchan had teaching assistants video-record themselves performing the experiments. Students watched the recordings and wrote up reports on what they observed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Amberchan recorded her lectures, she checked in with many students during office hours and review sessions. She thinks more students asked her questions in the online format than they would have in person. &#8220;I enjoyed it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think I was able to reach more students.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer session is the only time that anyone can take classes at UC Santa Cruz. Ariana Lyman, a high school student in New Mexico, also enjoyed her experience taking an online introductory course on oceanography.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You don&#8217;t experience the ocean here in the desert,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was cool learning about that because I don&#8217;t learn about it in school.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7a4cd43c8072701763b3cba66f01624d"><name>shs-closures</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>SHS Closures</title><summary>Student Health Center will be closed for mandatory staff trainings during these dates and times.</summary><start-date>1599721200000</start-date><display-name>SHS Closures</display-name><path>/2020/09/shs-closures</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/09/shs-closures</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1599779689503</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1599779794352</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear Campus Community,&#160;<br/><br/>Student Health Center will be closed for mandatory staff trainings during these dates and times:&#160;&#160;</p>

<p><span>But if somehow that still doesn&#8217;t convince you of the need for immediate action to mitigate its effects, you might check out <i>Sin Sol</i>, a new art game by UC Santa Cruz assistant professor of Art &amp; Design: Games and Playable Media, micha c&#225;rdenas.</span></p>
<p><span><i>Sin Sol</i> (No Sun) is an augmented reality game that allows players to experience the feelings of a climate change event. Set 50 years in the future, it tells the story of environmental collapse from the past&#8212;which is our present in 2020.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The game explores the intersection of personal trauma with environmental trauma, and how the feeling of being unable to breathe intertwines with the effects of climate induced wildfires. Part environmental archiving project, the environments in the game include actual 3-D scans of present-day forests from the Pacific Northwest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Users play by walking in real physical space to move through an augmented landscape with a holographic AI character named Aura, a transgender Latinx woman, and her dog Roja. With the goal of multispecies survival and solidarity, the dog guides the players on a journey to escape the wildfires and find oxygen capsules which contain poetry, telling more of the story as they progress through the landscape.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Sin Sol is an art game about the ways that climate change is differentially affecting people along lines of race, gender, ability and immigration status,&#8221; said c&#225;rdenas. &#8220;It tells this story through a personal narrative in a science fiction framework.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;The game learns from UCSC professor emeritus Donna Haraway's urging in her latest book for us to &#8216;stay with the trouble&#8217; of climate change, to face the difficult feelings we have, of loss and grief, so that we can push through and find beauty and companionship, even in a world on fire,&#8221; she added.</span></p>
<p><span>Developed over three years in collaboration with a number of artists, <i>Sin Sol</i> was created with the <a href="http://criticalrealities.sites.ucsc.edu/"><strong><i>Critical Realities Studio</i></strong></a>&#8212;a studio/lab for critical theory and art practice at UC Santa Cruz. Directed by c&#225;rdenas and supported by the Arts Division, it focuses on pressing issues the world currently faces, including climate change, racism, and gendered violence.</span></p>
<p><span>While in development, prototypes of the work were exhibited at the Thessaloniki Biennale in Greece (2019), the Leslie Lohman Museum in New York (2019), the <i>Refiguring the Future</i> exhibition in New York&#160;(2018) and the Henry Art Gallery in Seattle (2018). </span></p>
<p><span>C&#225;rdenas additionally did live performances of poetry and dance related to the project at the Thessaloniki Bienniale and the Leslie Lohman Museum.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span></span></p>

Since 1976, the ARCS Foundation's Northern California Chapter has given more than $2 million in scholarships to UCSC students.</p>
<p>The ARCS Foundation, founded in 1958, is a national organization that provides scholarships and fellowships for the country's most promising science, medical, and engineering students. This year's ARCS scholars at UC Santa Cruz represent the Science Communication Program and the Departments of Astronomy and Astrophysics; Biomolecular Engineering; Chemistry and Biochemistry; Computational Media; Computer Science and Engineering; Earth and Planetary Sciences; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; Electrical and Computer Engineering; Environmental Studies; Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology; Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology; Ocean Sciences; and Physics. The scholars and their interests are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Isabella Backman, Science Communication:</strong> Backman is an aspiring science journalist with a lifelong interest in environmental issues. She has a B.S. in biology and has studied the effects of climate change on intertidal organisms and the impact of rising temperatures on the diets of juvenile Atlantic cod. She has also worked as a writer for the environmental education newsletter <em>Ocean</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Oscar Cazares, Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology:</strong> Cazares is investigating the molecular pathways that regulate the fate of alveolar progenitor cells over multiple pregnancies. He hopes this research will lead to a therapeutic solution for milk insufficiency syndrome, which impacts the health of many women and children worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>Xian Chang, Biomolecular Engineering:</strong> Chang is developing algorithms used to conduct genomics research. Her work aims to add genetic diversity to representations of the human genome in order to make a reference genome that is more representative of the human population. This will make the human reference genome unbiased and more useful as a reference for studying samples from diverse genetic backgrounds.</p>
<p><strong>David Coulter, Astronomy and Astrophysics:</strong> Coulter&#8217;s research centers on observing and understanding the light produced in association with gravitational waves by the mergers of compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars. His team was the first to locate such a source, a flash of light produced by the merger of two neutron stars. This research addresses fundamental questions regarding the physics of such events, their effect on the synthesis of the heaviest elements, and the expansion history of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>Graham Edwards, Earth and Planetary Sciences:</strong> A geochemist specializing in radioisotopic dating, Edwards approaches problems in areas ranging from climate science to planet formation by constructing timelines of past events. He uses radioisotopic dating to resolve the timescales of glacial erosion and the growth and collapse of ice sheets, as well as the thermal structure and nature of the earliest forming planetary bodies of our solar system.</p>
<p><strong>Aviv Elor, Computational Media:</strong> Elor&#8217;s research explores extended reality by combining immersive environments, wearable robotics, and biofeedback for health applications. He aims to augment assistive technologies through gamification by creating interactive experiences that are both physically and emotionally intelligent in assisting users.</p>
<p><strong>Spenser Everett, Physics:</strong> Everett studies how dark matter and dark energy influence the expansion of the universe and the growth of large-scale structures of galaxies. He is primarily interested in understanding the accelerating expansion of the universe thought to be caused by dark energy, as well as how dark matter and dark energy have influenced the growth of the large-scale structure of galaxies that we see today.</p>
<p><strong>Hope Ianiri, Ocean Sciences:</strong> Ianiri is investigating how the deep ocean stores organic carbon and modulates climate change. Organic carbon accumulates in the ocean and persists for thousands of years, but scientists have an extremely limited understanding of the mechanisms that control this process and how it will respond to the changing climate.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Johnson, Electrical and Computer Engineering:</strong> Johnson&#8217;s research focuses on parameter estimation and system identification for hybrid dynamical systems with applications to aerospace, robotics, and power systems. His current research project proposes an estimation scheme that determines the input voltage and load resistance applied to a DC-to-DC boost converter circuit, a common component in the battery systems of electric vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Giordan Kitts, Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology:</strong> Kitts is interested in the signal transduction networks used by pathogenic bacteria to sense, respond, and adapt to environmental signals during infection and transmission. His current research focuses on a signal transduction system that regulates biofilm gene expression and virulence in the cholera bacteria, <em>Vibrio cholerae</em>, and the role of this system in <em>V. cholerae&#8217;s</em> lifecycle.</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Melchor, Science Communication:</strong> Melchor is pursuing a career in science journalism after earning her B.S. in microbiology and Ph.D. in experimental pathology. During her doctoral dissertation work, she discovered how aspects of chronic inflammation lead to chronic muscle wasting and tissue scarring during <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> infection, leading to unnecessary sickness.</p>
<p><strong>Lena Meyers, Chemistry and Biochemistry: </strong>Meyers studies the antibodies targeting the human astrovirus, a major cause of viral diarrhea, especially in children and immunocompromised people. Using structural biology, biochemistry, and protein engineering techniques, her efforts are laying a foundation for the development of a vaccine to prevent human astrovirus infection.</p>
<p><strong>Anna Nisi, Environmental Studies:</strong> Nisi studies the puma population in the Santa Cruz Mountains, with a focus on how habitat fragmentation impacts puma movement ecology and population dynamics. Her work also considers how urban planning and land use policy impact habitat quality and connectivity in neighboring exurban and wildland areas. Through this research, Nisi hopes to inform conservation planning and management policy and shed light on how large carnivores and people can coexist in fragmented landscapes.</p>
<p><strong>Megan Sabal, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology:</strong> Sabal is interested in the effects of predators on migrating prey, focusing on the non-consumptive effects (as opposed to the direct effects of predators eating prey). She is studying migrating juvenile Chinook salmon, and is also developing theory and conducting reviews that span a range of migratory taxa.</p>
<p><strong>Maggie Thompson, Astronomy and Astrophysics:</strong> Thompson&#8217;s research aims to determine the connection between the interior composition of rocky planets and the composition of their atmospheres. The objective is to constrain the initial atmospheric ingredients via meteorite outgassing experiments, thermodynamic modeling, and geochemical analyses. Understanding the factors that control planetary atmospheres is a key constraint for modeling the atmospheres of exoplanets.</p>
<p><strong>Pavlo Vlastos, Computer Science and Engineering:</strong> Vlastos&#8217;s research interests include designing control systems for autonomous surface vehicles, attitude and heading reference systems, path planning, trajectory generation, and system identification. His current project is an autonomous boat designed to help oceanographers study transient phenomena at less expense.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8d9aff968072701763b3cba6adf0e54e"><name>yulianna-ortega-outstanding-staff-2020</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Outstanding Staff Award honoree is a passionate advocate for STEM diversity</title><summary>Yulianna Ortega, the campus's STEM Diversity Programs director, has earned the trust and respect of fellow staff members, faculty, and students across divisions.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yulianna Ortega&#160;<span>(</span>Merrill,<span>&#160;'09, Latin American &amp; Latino studies and biology) is</span>&#160;a passionate advocate and mentor, working hard to bridge the diversity gap in science, engineering, and technology.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her time at UC Santa Cruz, Ortega, the campus's STEM Diversity Programs director, has earned the trust and respect of fellow staff members, faculty, and students across divisions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now she is getting campuswide recognition for all of her contributions to UC Santa Cruz. After 15 years of excellent work on campus, she is being honored with this year&#8217;s Outstanding Staff Award.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Ortega&#8217;s great surprise, the good news came on her birthday. &#8220;I was elated and grateful to celebrate this milestone with those that have shaped me: my culture, my parents, my husband, my two daughters, my community, my teachers, and mentors and those that support the work I do.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ortega has a longstanding personal commitment to her work. &#8220;I believe many talented individuals are hidden in the communities that are not traditionally represented in STEM,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Over the past 15 years of serving students, I&#8217;ve witnessed students manage and excel in academics while overcoming personal hardships, structural barriers and racism."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Throughout the years I continue to stay in touch with many of these students, so I am overwhelmed with joy and humbled by their nomination,&#8221; Ortega said. &#8220;While the world might recognize them as scientists, I have the honor of knowing them as individuals. My reward comes from knowing the most amazing human beings with the most impressive talents.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mentoring is an essential part of her work. &#8220;It promotes resilience," Ortega said. "It celebrates diversity, culture, and individual identities while embracing scientific discovery to solve the world&#8217;s pressing issues.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UCSC STEM Diversity Programs encompass a variety of programs that support underrepresented students in STEM fields.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Office of STEM Diversity Programs is an umbrella office that includes programs funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, as well as state-funded and donor-supported programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ever-humble Ortega&#8212;affectionately known as &#8220;Yuli&#8221;&#8212;wants to share her recent successes and this latest honor with her staff members Xingci Situ and Daniela Bolanos and the faculty directors of the programs her department runs, along with the talented students who have gone on to represent UC Santa Cruz at universities and workplaces all over the world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you for making space and time, and for all your effort in recognizing staff,&#8221; Ortega said, addressing the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Alumni Association, which administers the award</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;I am committed to the values of community, diversity, and inclusion at UCSC, and I am happy to work alongside all of you, too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Situ was expansive about Ortega&#8217;s talent and influence in her letter of recommendation to the selection committee. She noted that Ortega has mentored over 1,000 undergraduate and graduate students since 2005, when she started out as a program assistant in the STEM Diversity Programs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a first-generation college student and Latina woman in STEM, she understands the daily struggles, family pressures, and mental stress that minority students face every day,&#8221; Situ said. &#8220;Ms. Ortega is a person who deeply cares about students&#8217; academic success and their well-being. She has a unique perspective of student mentoring in which she believes in individualized mentorship. She always makes herself available to the students whenever they need to talk.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Situ also called attention to Ortega&#8217;s warm and welcoming personality, describing her as &#8220;selfless, and a giver at heart, always carrying a positive and uplifting attitude.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Astronomy and Astrophysics Professor Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz praised her vision and commitment, as well as her effectiveness as a leader.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Moving an organization toward greater diversity, equity, and inclusion requires intentional, committed, and often courageous leadership,&#8221; Ramirez-Ruiz said. &#8220;Yuli has been able to articulate a unique vision and model the changes that are needed to create meaningful change at UCSC. Yuli is one of the most gifted mentors and has empowered hundreds of students. Her intelligence and grace set the bar high for campus leaders and students alike, and she continues to serve as one of our greatest inspirations. I am incredibly lucky to work alongside her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students who have been mentored by Ortega also praised her commitment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"As a minority student, I have always felt that she has had my back and well-being in mind,&#8221; said Stephanie Nystrom, a graduate student in the Department of Molecular, Cell &amp; Developmental Biology. &#8220;She takes everything seriously and is active in learning to keep up with everything that is going on with her students and the climate. If she does not understand our experiences, she is willing to listen and educate herself. This allows her to become an even better mentor every year for the future students that come through the program.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UCSC Alumni Association established the Outstanding Staff Award in 1995. After 25 years, this award continues to recognize and celebrate staff who have displayed distinguished service to student life, the growth and improvement of UCSC's programs, and the preservation of UCSC's unique intellectual and physical environment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni value the hard work and dedication of UCSC staff and look forward to this opportunity to honor them with this annual award.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron Jones, UCSC&#8217;s Associate Director for Black Student Success, and chair of the campus&#8217;s Staff Advisory Board, spoke of the importance of the annual staff awards, as well as the many impressive contenders in this year&#8217;s field.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The 2020 nominations pool was awe-inspiring, comprising over 100 nominees, who represent a vast array of backgrounds, job titles, campus units, and years of experience,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While there were many excellent and deserving candidates this year," Jones said, "the nominations for Yulianna Ortega spoke to her true dedication to her students, as well as staff and faculty colleagues; the positive impact her work with the STEM Diversity Program has had for the campus; and how much she has contributed to the success of the individual students she works with.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8e9ce40d8072701763b3cba6fadeda5c"><name>usnwr-rankings</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz ranks again as a top university for social mobility</title><summary>The ranking (No. 4) speaks to the campus’s success in offering a world-class education to low income and first-generation students.</summary><start-date>1600066800000</start-date><display-name>U.S. News and World Report Rankings</display-name><path>/2020/09/usnwr-rankings</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/09/usnwr-rankings</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1600120480747</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1600120480747</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/09/images/rankings-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/09/images/rankings-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rankings-500px.jpg</name><display-name>rankings-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>821579</file-size><width>500</width><height>750</height></image><image-alt>Students at picnic table</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/09/images/rankings-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/09/images/rankings-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rankings-80px.jpg</name><display-name>rankings-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>19013</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Students at picnic table</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz again ranked among the top public universities (No. 40) and the best national universities (No. 97).

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ranking (No. 4) speaks to the campus&#8217;s success in offering a </span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-california-santa-cruz-1321"><span style="font-weight: 400;">world-class education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to low income and first-generation students. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. News and World Report </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">measures how well U.S. universities graduated students who received federal Pell Grants, which are typically awarded to students who come from households that earn less than $50,000 annually.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While it&#8217;s our values&#8212;not rankings&#8212;that guide our efforts, we do take pride in again having our success in supporting social mobility recognized,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;This is a ranking that reflects the hard work of students to attain their degree.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz is dedicated to providing access to a high quality education to students from all backgrounds and giving them the tools and support to succeed in their transformative college journey. Fall quarter instruction begins Oct. 1, and UC Santa Cruz will educate more than 5,000 students from low-income backgrounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of California is an equalizer for students from low-income families. They go on to earn as much as students who came from middle-income families, and their earnings double by a decade after graduation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. News and World Report rankings also placed UC Santa Cruz in the top 15 universities based on ethnic diversity. The diversity index for UC Santa Cruz was .72&#8212;with values closer to 1.0 meaning a student is more likely to run into students from a different ethnic group. In fall 2019, 34 percent of the undergraduate class identified as Asian, 25 percent was Hispanic/Latino, 4 percent was African American, and .5 percent was American Indian.</span></p>

<p>Five years of federal funding from the Title V Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) Program will support a new project, "Graduating and Advancing New American Scholars (GANAS) - Career Pathways."</p>
<p>The GANAS project aims to support Latinx, low-income, and underrepresented students by removing barriers that impede their success at UC Santa Cruz and preparing them for rewarding careers once they graduate. UC Santa Cruz is developing programs to help students remain in science and engineering majors, graduate on time, and secure post-college jobs that support their career objectives.</p>
<p>"UC Santa Cruz attracts outstanding Latinx students from both high schools and community colleges,&#8221; said Charis Herzon, director of HSI Initiatives. &#8220;Maintaining pathways to desired majors and careers and building leadership skills are critical components of how we serve our students.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are four main elements in the GANAS Project: redesigning two math courses that are preventing students from continuing in life sciences majors, providing additional instruction to help students in courses critical to their major, increasing career advising and offering more career-based internships in California&#8217;s high-demand fields, and helping the campus successfully address practices or policies that are contributing to inequity.</p>
<img alt="Student with Sammy the Slug" height="220" src="images/hsi-grant-sammy-300px.jpg" style="margin: 10px 5px; float: right;" width="300"/>
<p>&#8220;We are excited for the ways in which GANAS deepens our ability to be a more holistic Hispanic Serving Institution,&#8221; interim Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Success Jennifer Baszile said. &#8220;The HSI work is at the center of our institutional commitment to student success.&#8221;</p>
<p>Starting this year, UC Santa Cruz faculty, staff, and graduate student researchers will redesign the two-part calculus series Math 11A and 11B with a focus on active learning and problem-solving sessions to support inclusiveness and equity. The comprehensive overhaul is meant to increase course grades and passing rates and reduce achievement gaps. The plan is to offer a redesigned Math 11A in fall 2021 and Math 11B in fall 2022.</p>
<p>The campus this year will create a team of student leaders who will provide supplemental instruction to students who are struggling in courses critical to their major. In addition to helping students continue with their chosen major, the program will support students in developing their leadership skills. <br/><br/>To increase career advising, internship opportunities, and financial literacy of Latinx, low-income, and underrepresented students, UC Santa Cruz will develop year-long career-based internships that focus on California&#8217;s workforce needs across biotech, health, agriculture, accounting/finance, teaching/education, and STEM. Interns will also take a career readiness/financial literacy course and participate in quarterly career advising sessions.<br/><br/>The final goal is to support academic and student services departments in identifying racial disparities, developing ways to address practices or policies that are contributing to inequity, and evaluating whether the changes are successful in increasing equity. <br/><br/>The GANAS Career Pathways Project is a campus partnership that includes UCSC HSI Initiatives, Career Center, Center for Innovations in Teaching &amp; Learning, Educational Opportunity Programs, Learning Support Services, and the Mathematics Department. <br/><br/>Enrollment of Latinx undergraduate students at UC Santa Cruz crossed the 25 percent threshold to be considered a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) by the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities in 2012. Since then, the campus has been <a href="https://hsi.ucsc.edu/hsi-grants/index.html">awarded four grants</a> totaling $12.8 million since earning the HSI designation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="93c9561c8072701763b3cba65b0733c0"><name>electric-aircraft</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC engineers developing all-electric power train for future aircraft</title><summary>Funding from the Department of Energy for the UCSC team is part of a major effort to develop carbon-neutral hybrid electric aviation.</summary><keywords>Leila Parsa</keywords><start-date>1600153200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC engineers developing all-electric power train for future aircraft</display-name><path>/2020/09/electric-aircraft</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/09/electric-aircraft</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1600207279617</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1600207475262</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/09/images/leila-parsa.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2020/09/images/leila-parsa.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>leila-parsa.jpeg</name><display-name>leila-parsa.jpeg</display-name><file-size>37650</file-size><width>250</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Leila Parsa</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/09/images/leila-parsa-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/09/images/leila-parsa-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>leila-parsa-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>leila-parsa-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>13731</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Leila Parsa</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Leila Parsa</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Funding from the Department of Energy for the UCSC team is part of a major effort to develop carbon-neutral hybrid electric aviation</article-subhead><article-text><p>A team led by Leila Parsa, professor of electrical and computer engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, has received funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to develop an innovative all-electric power train that will help enable net-zero carbon emissions for commercial aircraft.</p>
<p>The $854,000 grant is part of a wider effort by the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to develop enabling technologies for long-range carbon-neutral commercial aviation. Parsa&#8217;s team includes Keith Corzine, professor of electrical and computer engineering, and researchers at the Air Force Research Laboratory.</p>
<p>The ARPA-E ASCEND program (Aviation-class Synergistically Cooled Electric-motors with iNtegrated Drives) is focused on an all-electric power train as the prime mover for long-range, narrow-body aircraft such as the Boeing 737. Current electric power trains do not have high enough power density and efficiency to meet the requirements for this class of aircraft.</p>
<p>Parsa&#8217;s team proposes to use innovative technologies for every aspect of the power train.</p>
<p>&#8220;All three components&#8212;the electric motor, the power electronics, and the thermal management system&#8212;will require innovative designs to get to an ultralight and highly power-dense system,&#8221; Parsa said.</p>
<p>Their plans include a flux-switching motor with superconducting field coils, which has been shown to be smaller and lighter than conventional designs. The electronics are based on state-of-the-art multilevel inverter technology leading to improved efficiency and lower electromagnetic noise. The cooling technology is a hybrid system containing ultralight cryogenics as well as traditional air cooling methods.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide emissions per passenger from commercial air travel are nearly double that of any other widely used transportation mode. The narrow-body (single-aisle) commercial aircraft targeted in this research program are estimated to be responsible for nearly half of aviation-related greenhouse-gas emissions. Such an aircraft with an all-electric propulsion system operating on carbon-neutral liquid fuels, however, would have net-zero emissions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal is to reduce emissions, as well as the energy costs, of commercial air travel,&#8221; Parsa said. &#8220;Our team is excited to work on this challenging project because of its transformative nature and real-world applications.&#8221;</p>
<p>A related ARPA-E program (Range Extenders for Electric Aviation with Low Carbon and High Efficiency, or REEACH) focuses on the energy storage and power generation sub-systems for electric aircraft. DOE has announced a total of $33 million in funding for 17 projects in Phase 1 of the ASCEND and REEACH programs.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

investors have turned farmland into a lucrative financial asset class</article-subhead><article-text><p>In her new book, <em>Fields of Gold, Financing the Global Land Rush</em>, (Cornell University Press, 2020) Madeleine Fairbairn looks at forces and players that have transformed farmland into a novel financial asset class, a practice that took hold after the 2008 financial crisis and continues today. <br/><br/>Different from mega corporate farms, the financialization of farmland involves huge institutional investors, such as pension funds and university endowments, adding farmland to their portfolios along with stocks, bonds, commodities, and commercial real estate, assets they hope will grow in value. Fairbairn, a rural sociologist, is an assistant professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz whose research focuses on the political ecology of the global agri-food system. Fields of Gold is published in hardcover, paperback, and as an open access e-book. <br/><br/>The full effects of viewing farmland as a financial investment have yet to be seen, Fairbairn says, but there is concern that the phenomenon could lead to higher land prices, putting farmland ownership even further out of reach for small farmers, particularly those from historically marginalized social groups.<br/><br/><strong>A commodity that cannot circulate</strong></p>
<p>As Fairbairn writes, farmland is &#8220;a commodity that was not produced and cannot circulate, a source of personal independence and of group identity, a productive asset that moonlights as a financial asset.&#8221;<br/><br/>In the U.S., the story dates back to the 1970s when the concept of turning farmland into an investment asset was first proposed and roundly criticized. When Congress held hearings in 1977 there was bipartisan agreement that allowing pension funds to buy up farmland was morally reprehensible, Fairbairn said. &#8220;It was considered awful for farmers and awful for America.&#8221; <br/><br/><strong>The 'Farm Crisis' and 'Farm Aid'<br/></strong></p>
<p>In the early 1980s, however, things shifted when small farms came under pressure from falling crop prices and increasing mortgage repayments. The &#8220;Farm Crisis&#8221; that resulted drew widespread attention, including the first &#8220;Farm Aid&#8221; concert in September 1985 when Willie Nelson, John Mellencamp, and other stars played to raise money for beleaguered family farmers. <br/><br/>Despite the publicity and fundraising, many farm foreclosures followed, and life insurance companies and commercial banks, which had lent money for farm mortgages, had to figure out what to do with all the foreclosed farm properties now on their books.<br/><br/>That created a demand for &#8220;experts&#8221; to manage the farmland assets. &#8220;There was not widespread investor interest at that point,&#8221; Fairbairn said, &#8220;but the Farm Crisis really laid the groundwork by training a whole crop of professionals to manage farmland on behalf of institutional investors. Once macro conditions changed to once again favor farmland investment, those professionals were ready to step in.&#8221;<br/><br/>Those macroeconomic conditions began to manifest themselves in the 2000s with a boom in agricultural commodity prices. &#8220;There was a huge spike in food prices in 2008 and again in 2011.&#8221; <br/><br/><strong>Stock market and real estate tank</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the stock market plunged and real estate tanked because of the subprime mortgage crisis. But high crop prices meant high income coming from the land and &#8220;farmland looked like a solid asset and safe haven for capital,&#8221; Fairbairn said. <br/><br/>Hedge funds, pension funds, and other investment entities looked to farmland to bolster their portfolios. As an example, TIAA, the leading retirement investor for the academic community, owned no agricultural land before about 2007. A decade later, TIAA controlled $8 billion worth of farmland globally. <br/><br/>The hype surrounding farmland investment has died down somewhat since 2014, Fairbairn said. However, new farmland funds continue to be established, leaving many farmer advocates worried about the ongoing separation of the land owner from the land user. &#8220;The real fear is that this will increase the very high barriers to entry that already exist in agriculture,&#8221; she said. <br/><br/>There is also a concern that investor-owners may approach their stewardship of land, as well as their relationships with tenants and neighbors, differently than would owners with roots in farming communities. &#8220;Portfolio ownership is ownership stripped of everything but the profits and losses,&#8221; Fairbairn writes. &#8220;Gone are the responsibilities and relationships that ownership used to imply.&#8221;<br/><br/><strong>Local impact of finacialization</strong></p>
<p>In <em>Fields of Gold</em>, Fairbairn focuses on the forces and players of the financialization phenomenon, particularly in the U.S. and Brazil. Her current research looks at its effects. She&#8217;s in the midst of a study, supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, that looks at the impact of farmland financialization in California and Illinois.<br/><br/>&#8220;Financial-sector demand for farmland should serve as a wake-up call,&#8221; Fairbairn writes. &#8220;Land is too vital&#8212;to the pride of farmers, to the cultural identity of indigenous peoples, to the food security of rural communities&#8212;to be casually surrendered to wealthy institutions for whom it serves as just one more weapon in an investment arsenal.&#8221;<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9d5e6e338072701763b3cba6819c7b93"><name>constitution-day-and-exercising-right-to-vote</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Constitution Day and exercising the right to vote</title><summary>Citizens exercising the right to vote is a bedrock of our constitutional democracy, and we encourage you to participate in this most fundamental aspect of civic engagement.

<div>Today is Constitution Day, a federal observance that recognizes the signing of the U.S. Constitution on this day in 1787 in Philadelphia. Citizens exercising the right to vote is a bedrock of our constitutional democracy, and we encourage you to participate in this most fundamental aspect of civic engagement. With the general election about six weeks away, now is the time to make sure you're prepared to cast a ballot.<br/><br/><strong>Register to vote</strong><br/>There is still time to register to vote for the Nov. 3 election. California residents can <a href="https://registertovote.ca.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">register online</a>. Your registration must be postmarked or submitted electronically no later than Oct. 19. <br/><br/>The University of California has developed a <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/civic-engagement/register" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website to help students register to vote</a> for the first time or to re-register with their current address. <br/><br/><strong>Double check your registration</strong><br/>If you&#8217;re already registered to vote, take two minutes to double-check your registration online through <a href="https://voterstatus.sos.ca.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">California&#8217;s voter-status website</a>. Anything incorrect can be corrected online. <br/><br/><strong>Track your ballot</strong><br/>Vote-by-mail ballots will be issued Oct. 5, so it&#8217;s well worth registering as soon as possible so you can receive your ballot early. The California Secretary of State is also offering a new way for voters to track and receive noti&#64257;cations on the status of their mail-in ballot through the <a href="https://california.ballottrax.net/voter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Where&#8217;s My Ballot? website</a>. <br/><br/><strong>Cast your ballot</strong><br/>While polls will be open for in-person voting, many people may choose to vote by mail this year. Those ballots can be dropped off at <a href="https://www.votescount.us/Home/UpcomingElections/November3,2020Election/Votinglocations1120.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">any polling station</a> on Election Day or at <a href="https://www.votescount.us/Home/UpcomingElections/November3,2020Election/Ballotdropboxes1120.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">designated ballot drop-off locations</a> prior to Election Day. If you are not voting in Santa Cruz County, check your local county for more information.<br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz will again have a polling location on campus at the Merrill Cultural Center. The polling station will be open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Nov 2-3 for in-person voting and ballot drop-off. There is also an official ballot drop-off box located in front of the Bay Tree Bookstore. The campus is also providing <a href="https://urelations.ucsc.edu/about/units/government/vote/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">election and voting information online</a>.&#160;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Same-day voter registration</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Same-day voter registration, known as conditional voter registration in state law, is a safety net for Californians who have missed the deadline to register to vote or to update their voter registration information for an election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eligible voters who need to register or re-register to vote within 14 days of an election can complete this process and vote at a county elections office, polling place, or voting center. Their ballots will be processed and counted once the county elections office has completed the voter-verification process.</span></p>

Mellon Native American Scholars Initiative Fellow at the American Philosophical Society.</p>
<p>The American Philosophical Society, based in Philadelphia, is the oldest learned society in the United States. Benjamin Franklin founded it in 1743 for the purpose of &#8220;promoting useful knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>This year the Society awarded five long-term fellowships, one digital humanities fellowship, and 36 short-term fellowships and internships for scholarly research in the history of science, Native American studies, and early American history.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our fellows conduct cutting edge research in a wide range of fields, and every year they make new discoveries in our collections that change what we know about our past,&#8221; said the society&#8217;s librarian Patrick Spero.</p>
<p>Mart&#237;nez&#8217;s dissertation is "Rethinking Structural Inequalities and Emotional Illnesses in Oaxacan Communities."</p>
<p>She said she &#8220;chose to accept an APS fellowship because it will provide me with the ability and space to advance my dissertation and prepare for academic positions. The APS makes up a vibrant community of interdisciplinary scholars that include scholars in Early American History, Curatorial Studies, Bibliography and Biography Studies, and History of Science Technology and Medicine.</p>
<p>&#8220;The APS will surely push me away from my comfort zone of engaging mostly with Latin American and Latina/o Studies scholars. It will be exciting to be in conversation with other people who may not necessarily be in my field."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url> https://www.amphilsoc.org/blog/2020-2021-library-museum-fellows</url><title>American Philosophical Society announcement</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b2656a318072701763b3cba66f41f1dc"><name>bioelectronics</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Bioelectronic device achieves unprecedented control of cell membrane voltage</title><summary>A closed-loop biohybrid device driven by a machine learning algorithm maintained a set membrane voltage in human stem cells for 10 hours.</summary><keywords>Marco Rolandi, Marcella Gomez</keywords><start-date>1600956000000</start-date><display-name>Bioelectronic device achieves unprecedented control of cell membrane voltage</display-name><path>/2020/09/bioelectronics</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/09/bioelectronics</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1600720824850</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1600957163009</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Electrical Engineering</value><value>Computer Engineering</value><value>Applied Mathematics and Statistics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/09/images/device2-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/09/images/device2-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>device2-400.jpg</name><display-name>device2-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>59695</file-size><width>400</width><height>291</height></image><image-alt>gloved fingers holding bioelectronic device</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/09/images/device2-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/09/images/device2-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>device2-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>device2-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18464</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>gloved fingers holding bioelectronic device</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The device used to control membrane voltage in living cells involves an array of bioelectronic proton pumps that add or remove hydrogen ions from solution next to cultured human stem cells.

<p>Every living cell maintains a voltage across the cell membrane that results from differences in the concentrations of charged ions inside and outside the cell. Often called the membrane potential or resting potential, this voltage is regulated by ion channels in the cell membrane and plays important roles in cell physiology and functions such as proliferation and differentiation.</p>
<p>Controlling cells with bioelectronics is difficult due to the complex ways cells respond to changes in their environment and the natural self-regulating feedback process known as homeostasis. Cells regulate ion movements to maintain a steady membrane voltage, so the researchers had to develop a system that could counteract this natural response.</p>
<p>&#8220;Biological feedback systems are fundamental to life, and their malfunctioning is often involved in diseases. This work demonstrates that we can tweak this feedback using a combination of bioelectronic devices actuated by machine learning, and potentially restore its functioning,&#8221; said Marco Rolandi, professor and chair of electrical and computer engineering at the UC Santa Cruz Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>Rolandi is the senior corresponding author of the paper describing this work, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aisy.202000140">published September 24 in the journal <em>Advanced Intelligent Systems</em></a>. The other corresponding authors who helped direct the project are Marcella Gomez, assistant professor of applied mathematics at UC Santa Cruz, and Michael Levin, director of the Center for Regenerative and Developmental Biology at Tufts University and associate faculty member of the Wyss Institute at Harvard University.</p>
<p>The researchers developed a system involving an array of bioelectronic proton pumps that add or remove hydrogen ions from solution in proximity to cultured human stem cells. The cells were genetically modified to express a fluorescent protein on the cell membrane that responds to changes in membrane voltage. The system is controlled by a machine learning algorithm that tracks how the membrane voltage responds to stimuli from the proton pumps.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a closed-loop system, in that it records the behavior of the cells, determines what intervention to deliver using the proton pumps, sees how the cells react, then determines the next intervention needed to achieve and maintain the membrane voltage status we desire,&#8221; Rolandi explained.</p>
<p>Gomez, who developed the machine learning algorithm, said the algorithm is not trained on any data in advance and does not rely on a model of the system. Instead, the &#8220;learning&#8221; happens in real time as the neural network responds to input regarding the current state of the membrane voltage.</p>
<p>&#8220;The adaptive nature of biology&#8212;that is, the ability of cells to change their response to external stimuli&#8212;calls for an adaptive approach in controls, where static models and past information can become obsolete,&#8221; Gomez said.</p>
<p>Because the membrane voltage of stem cells is different from that of mature, differentiated cells, the researchers are interested in the possibility of using the system to induce and direct the differentiation of stem cells into specific cell types. They did not, however, explicitly look at cell differentiation in this proof-of-concept study.</p>
<p>More broadly, the combination of bioelectronics and machine learning in a closed-loop biohybrid system has many potential applications in regenerative medicine and synthetic biology, Rolandi said. He noted that the results of this study will inform the team&#8217;s work on a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/02/wound-healing.html">major effort to develop a &#8220;smart bandage&#8221;</a> providing bioelectronic intelligent control of wound regeneration.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study is an important proof of concept for the use of bioelectronics and machine learning to control cell functions,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>First author John Selberg, a graduate student in Rolandi&#8217;s lab, designed the proton pumps and helped develop fabrication processes, characterize the devices, and perform experiments. Coauthor Mohammad Jafari, a postdoctoral researcher working with Gomez, designed the machine learning algorithm. Other coauthors include researchers in the Departments of Applied Mathematics and Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC Santa Cruz and at the Allen Discovery Center and Department of Biology at Tufts University.</p>

<p><span>Every summer I look forward to fall and the upcoming start of school. It is so energizing to welcome our newest Banana Slugs and to greet returning ones. This new academic year will not have the same in-person events we have enjoyed in the past, but it remains a new beginning for many of our students and for our campus.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>While COVID-19 requires us to implement extraordinary measures to maintain the health and well-being of our campus community, it is important to stay positive and to focus on opportunities rather than losses.</span></p>
<p><span>UC Santa Cruz has shown extraordinary resilience in adapting to the unexpected challenges and rapidly changing conditions brought about by COVID-19. Our faculty and staff have been innovative and creative in developing new ways to teach, mentor, support, and engage students. The latest information about resources for instructors and students is available on our <a data-cke-saved-href="https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/" href="https://keepteaching.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Keep Teaching</a> and <a data-cke-saved-href="https://keeplearning.ucsc.edu/" href="https://keeplearning.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Keep Learning</a> websites. And students, please note the <a data-cke-saved-href="https://keeplearning.ucsc.edu/additional-resources/remote-classroom-technology-survey" href="https://keeplearning.ucsc.edu/additional-resources/remote-classroom-technology-survey" rel="noopener" target="_blank">survey linked here</a> and at the bottom of the Keep Learning webpage. We want your feedback about how our remote instructional tools and platforms work for you. And if you do not have the computer equipment or internet connection you need to learn remotely, contact <a data-cke-saved-href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/covid-19-operations.html" href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/covid-19-operations.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Slug Support</a> so we can help.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Scaling back on-campus housing</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Our campus and the greater Santa Cruz community have been through a lot over the past month. The CZU Lightning Complex fire, which is still burning in parts of the Santa Cruz Mountains, has devastated the lives of thousands of local residents including many university affiliates. More than 900 homes were destroyed. In light of that and our efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID, we have further scaled back our plans for in-person instruction and on-campus housing.</span></p>
<p><span>After personal outreach by staff, about 1,000 students who were planning to live on campus this fall have now reconsidered and will instead remain at their current residences while they take classes remotely. I am deeply grateful for their consideration. This will help campus catch up on preparations for the approximately 1,000 students who will be living on campus this fall; these students either do not have alternative housing available or living arrangements conducive to remote instruction. A normal year would see anywhere from about 8,500 to 9,000 students living on campus.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Limiting the spread of COVID-19</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Fewer students residing on campus also will help us limit the spread of COVID and give us the time and space needed to scale up our COVID-19 testing operations. During the campus evacuation, our Molecular Diagnostics Lab lost valuable time preparing for the testing of the students, faculty, and staff who will be present on campus this fall. Our fall plans include regular asymptomatic testing. Regular and inclusive testing is critical in limiting the spread of this pandemic because many folks who have the virus and can infect others do not show symptoms. Also critical are the <a data-cke-saved-href="https://ucsc-recovery.netlify.app/returning-to-campus/do-your-part/" href="https://ucsc-recovery.netlify.app/returning-to-campus/do-your-part/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Slug Strong</a> actions each of us can undertake personally to protect our community, wearing face coverings and maintaining social-distancing chief among them.</span></p>
<p><span>We decided early this summer to take a careful approach to reopening campus this fall. A return to in-person classes did not seem wise based on the best public-health information we could gather. As we watch other institutions open, then change course and close after seeing large numbers of students test positive for COVID, our approach appears to be the correct one.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that does not make it any less disappointing for those of you who will be learning or working remotely, but know that we are committed to making this year both meaningful and productive. Our faculty and staff are working to make our curricula and teaching practices more effective and engaging, and they are pioneering new ways of building community remotely. Remember that this is a temporary crisis. UC Santa Cruz and our wonderful community of students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends will emerge from this pandemic more resilient, with a renewed commitment to our mission and <a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles-community.html" href="https://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles-community.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Principles of Community</a>. And don&#8217;t forget that &#8220;celebrative&#8221; is one of those principles! Whether you are in Santa Cruz or living and studying from afar, I urge you all to find ways to safely celebrate life&#8217;s victories and simple pleasures.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Contributing to our community</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I hope you will think about ways you can contribute to our community through your ideas, engagement, work, and, as you are able, donations. Giving Day is Sept. 30 this year. Please take a look at our <a data-cke-saved-href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/o/university-of-california---santa-cruz/i/ucsc-giving-day-2020" href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/o/university-of-california---santa-cruz/i/ucsc-giving-day-2020" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Giving Day website</a> and learn more about our amazing student groups and how you can support them.</span></p>
<p><span>As we move through the next phase of the pandemic and look forward to the promise of a vaccine, we will take away many lessons from this experience. For me, one is the belief that a place, no matter how beautiful and special, does not define our university or our experiences. It's the people that make a university what it is.</span></p>
<p><span>I look forward to seeing you all virtually, and, when we are able to do so, in person. Until then, please stay safe, stay well, and stay connected.</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic and the devastating Northern California wildfires have added new urgency to this year&#8217;s </span><a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/o/university-of-california---santa-cruz/i/ucsc-giving-day-2020"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a high-octane, 24-hour online event of nonstop giving on September 30.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic has delayed the start of Giving Day, originally scheduled for April 22, and altered the format. Usually the celebration has a strong analog component, with booths of high-spirited students and supporters set up in hotspots across the campus, including Quarry Plaza. This year, however, COVID-related safety concerns led to an all-online event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now that we are about to begin a mostly remote learning experience, it will be more important than ever to support the programs and activities that make the UC Santa Cruz student experience so valuable and enriching,&#8221; said Emily Denning Todd, associate director of annual and digital giving for UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This playful but impactful philanthropic event had to pivot quickly this year, changing its structure and format to maximize its fundraising impact while keeping supporters and teams safe and socially distanced.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then again, Giving Day&#8217;s success owes something to its founders&#8217; creative and improvisatory talents.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This day started out as a fledgling fundraising event, known for its independent spirit and its willingness to break with custom. Rather than fall back on traditional modes of giving, this event encouraged &#8220;micro-donations&#8221;&#8212;small but important gifts that fund worthy programs while increasing the campus&#8217;s circle of loyal supporters, attracting and encouraging future giving.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, expect to see some old favorites vying for support. But statewide and international emergencies have led to new funding needs, including the </span><a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/o/university-of-california---santa-cruz/i/ucsc-giving-day-2020/s/covid-19-response-fund"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 Response Fund, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">which helps fund critical research at the Molecular Diagnostic Lab, where researchers have implemented a testing process on campus that identifies active COVID-19 cases.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Separately, a team in the antibody testing center is working to develop a test to detect COVID-19 antibodies in blood. If used widely, such a test would allow researchers to quantify the fraction of the community that has been exposed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic also adds new weight to the </span><a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/o/university-of-california---santa-cruz/i/ucsc-giving-day-2020/s/smith-society-summer-scholarships"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith Society</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program, which is helping to raise funds for UC Santa Cruz students who are former foster youth. The funds will help the students focus on their academic work and thrive during a time of distance learning and severe economic stress.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Smith Society students need to work to make ends meet each month. Many of those students are now struggling to find employment and paid internships during the pandemic. Securing employment, and Smith leadership positions, will help those students be successful, project organizers said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another funding need, the </span><a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/o/university-of-california---santa-cruz/i/ucsc-giving-day-2020/s/2020-wildfire-relief"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 Wildfire Relief Fund, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">is the work of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz community members banding together to support Banana Slugs impacted by the devastating blazes.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, the COVID-19 pandemic has done nothing to drain the organizers&#8217; drive and enthusiasm for Giving Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Being a mostly remote campus has its challenges, but we are taking it in stride,&#8221; Todd said. &#8220;It has been extraordinary to see how this year's Giving Day groups have energized their peers to continue to participate in Giving Day. Over 140 different areas of campus are participating. We hope that, through the support of our generous donors, they raise the funds they need to continue offering their life-changing programs&#8212;no matter what 2020 throws our way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the format has changed somewhat, most of Giving Day&#8217;s popular traditions will continue this year. As in past years, the giving will start in the middle of the night. Supporters will start funding programs at the stroke of 12 a.m. on September 30 and keep on going until 11:59 p.m. Supporters will stay glued to the </span><a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/o/university-of-california---santa-cruz/i/ucsc-giving-day-2020"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving Day page,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which will provide up-to-the-moment tallies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, supporters should keep a close watch on &#8220;challenge times,&#8221; during which the project that has the most unique donors in a specified time period is awarded bonus dollars.And that relentless pace does not let up. This is not a marathon. It&#8217;s more like a series of hundred-yard dashes, including an all-out push to the finish line at the very end.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That last-minute burst at the end of the day has its reward: The group that has the most unique donors during the whole day is awarded bonus dollars. </span></p>

<p><span>Last night, UC Santa Cruz alumna Maya Rudolph picked up her second Emmy of the week for her impression of California senator and Democratic vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris on <i>Saturday Night Live,</i> in the category of Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.</span></p>
<p><span>A few days before, Rudolph had received her first-ever Emmy trophy, this time for Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performance, as the voice of Connie the Hormone Monstress, on the animated </span><span>Netflix series, <i>Big </i><i>Mou</i><i>th</i></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Rudolph had a total of three Emmy nominations this year, but was actually competing with herself (along with Angela Bassett, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Wanda Sykes, and Bette Midler) </span><span>in the category of Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.&#160;</span>Her role as a&#160;judge in&#160;NBC's&#160;<em>The Good Pl</em><i>ace</i> made Emmy history by earning Rudolph a double nomination in the same category as the <em>SNL</em> show.</p>
<p><span>Backstage in the press room, she recalled that her <i>Good Place</i> character&#8217;s wardrobe had been inspired by Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on Friday.</span></p>
<p><span>"When you think of a judge, when you think of all-knowing, when you think of powerful, when you think of all good, yeah, we modeled her robe after RBG, so that was pretty cool," said Rudolph.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>A 1995 graduate of UCSC&#8217;</strong>s Porter College with a B.A. in Art (photography), Rudolph </span><span>spent seven seasons on <i>Saturday Night Live</i> and became widely known for her portrayals of Oprah Winfrey, Donatella Versace, Whitney Houston, Diana Ross, Jennifer Lopez, Maya Angelou, Tyra Banks, Tina Turner, Michelle Obama, and Beyonc&#233;.</span></p>
<p><span>Before turning to comedy in the 1990s, she enjoyed a brief stint in the music biz. Her first band, Supersauce, was formed at UC Santa Cruz with fellow students, and she went on to sing and play keyboards with The Rentals, touring the United States and Europe. After leaving the band, Rudolph joined the legendary improv troupe, The Groundlings, before heading off to <i>SNL</i>.</span></p>
<p><span>She has since gone on to star in several high-profile films, including <i>Grown-Ups</i>, <i>The Zookeeper</i>, and the international hit <i>Bridesmaids</i>. Rudolph has also lent her voice to the animated films <i>Shrek the Third</i> and <i>Big Hero 6.</i></span></p>
<p><span>Her television work includes the CBS medical drama series <i>City of Angels</i> and <i>Chicago Hope</i>. She also co-starred in the NBC sitcom <i>Up All Night</i>, with Christina Applegate and Will Arnett, and co-hosted an NBC variety series, <i>Maya &amp; Marty,</i> with Martin Short.</span></p>
<p><span>Rudolph also occasionally performs with "Princess," the cover band that she created with fellow UCSC alumna Gretchen Lieberum through their mutual love of Prince&#8217;s music. Together, they have performed at such venues as the Hollywood Bowl, <i>Late Night with Jimmy Fallon</i>, and Yoshi&#8217;s in San Francisco.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b6a7625d8072701763b3cba6e3d3e144"><name>wildfire-relief</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Wildfire relief grants awarded to employees, students</title><summary>Through generous gifts from alumni, donors, and the campus community, UC Santa Cruz has been able to provide more than 60 grants to the employees who were most severely impacted.</summary><start-date>1600758000000</start-date><display-name>Wildfire relief</display-name><path>/2020/09/wildfire-relief</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/09/wildfire-relief</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1600792257091</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1600792295495</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The recent wildfire in the Santa Cruz Mountains affected many people in the UC Santa Cruz community.

<p>Fortney shared the prize with Heather Knutson, professor of geological and planetary sciences at the California Institute of Technology. The award ceremony took place September 22 during the EPSC 2020 virtual meeting and was followed by 15-minute prize lectures by the winners.</p>
<p>The annual prize, established in 2010 to honor the memory of Italian scientist Paolo Farinella (1953&#8208;2000), acknowledges an outstanding researcher not older than 47 years (the age of Farinella when he passed away) who has achieved important results in one of Farinella&#8217;s fields of work. Each year the prize focuses on a different research area. In 2020, the tenth edition was devoted to the giant planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, as well as giant exoplanets.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am honored to be selected for the 2020 Farinella Prize,&#8221; said Fortney, who directs the Other Worlds Laboratory at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;I owe so much to my scientific mentors and collaborators who have helped me along the way. Paolo was an important scientist with a diverse range of interests, and it is great to be associated with his contributions to science.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortney&#8217;s theoretical work has led to a much better understanding of the atmospheres, interiors, and evolution of giant planets. He has been able to provide theoretical evidence that helium in Saturn&#8217;s interior is dramatically concentrated into a helium-rich shell, and he has demonstrated that the pattern of enrichment in heavy elements in the solar system&#8217;s giant planets, compared to the sun, is also a relationship seen in giant exoplanets. Fortney has also developed sophisticated models of giant exoplanet atmospheres to understand their emitted spectra and atmospheric circulation.</p>
<p>Knutson is a leader in the observational characterization of the dynamics of exoplanetary atmospheres. She has led an ambitious observational program with both space-based and ground-based observatories to characterize hot Jupiters and sub-Neptune planets.</p>
<p>Both Knutson and Fortney lead active groups involving young researchers and students. Altogether, their work is providing the basis to better characterize giant planets and understand the formation of planets.</p>
<p>For 2020, the Farinella Prize also honors the memory of Adam P. Showman, who had accepted to be part of the prize committee, but passed away unexpectedly, leaving an immense body of theoretical work to understand the dynamics of planetary atmospheres.</p>
<p>&#8220;The past decade has seen great advances for our knowledge of giant planets both close to us, like Jupiter and Saturn, and much further for exoplanets,&#8221; said Tristan Guillot, president of the Farinella Prize Committee. &#8220;Heather Knutson and Jonathan Fortney have played a major part in those advances. The committee was unanimous in choosing them for the tenth Paolo Farinella Prize. It is also particularly fitting that both collaborated at some point in their career with Adam Showman. Adam was an inspiration for all of us, in particular in the field of the atmospheric dynamics of giant planets, until his untimely passing in February 2020. I&#8217;m sure that, as Paolo, he would have been proud of these nominations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortney received his B.S. in physics at Iowa State University and his Ph.D. in planetary science at the University of Arizona. He joined the UCSC faculty in 2008.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bc752a3d8072701763b3cba6abe21619"><name>legal-assistance-for-employees-impacted-by-wildfires</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Legal assistance for employees impacted by wildfires</title><summary>The aftermath of the wildfire continues to impact so many in our community.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Margaret Atwood is often described as a prophet of doom, and for good reason. She is an unsparing observer and predictor of environmental catastrophes, anti-utopias, authoritarian regimes, and biotech run amok.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, the author of the 1985 bestseller </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is not an obvious go-to choice for words of hope during this time of political fracturing, climate change, and a global pandemic.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Atwood offered some words of cautious encouragement and measured hope this week during her virtual dialogue with alumna and author Kate Schatz </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Stevenson &#8217;01, women&#8217;s studies and creative writing).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Believe it or not, but this is not the worst moment in the history of everything,&#8221; Atwood said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As you will notice by looking in the mirror, the human race has survived up until now," she continued. &#8220;We&#8217;re not robots yet, I don&#8217;t think. I think hope is built in. It&#8217;s something we have as human beings, and it&#8217;s gotten us through a lot of very tight spots before. If you don&#8217;t have hope, you don&#8217;t work for something that&#8217;s better because you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To the voters, I would say, something better </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">possible. And you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">vote,&#8221; said Atwood, during an event that fell on National Voter Registration Day. &#8220;Cherish that. It&#8217;s a right that other people have died for. Stage by stage, the right to participate in your society has been fought over for centuries. In Australia, it&#8217;s mandatory to vote. Unless you&#8217;re at death&#8217;s door, you must vote. It&#8217;s the law.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And make no mistake; Atwood, a Canadian, will be keeping a close eye on the elections this November.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The interesting thing for me is to see how the American people as a whole are going to deal with their erstwhile devotion to democracy,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This discussion was part of the Humanities Division&#8217;s Peggy Downes Baskin Ethics Lecture series.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atwood is this year&#8217;s recipient of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation medal, recognizing distinguished thinkers who exemplify the university&#8217;s vision and ideals.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 2,000 households tuned in to hear the talk, which was hosted by Bro Adams </span><strong>&#160;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Ph.D. &#8217;82, history of consciousness), chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities from 2014 to 2017.</span></p>
<p><strong>The long shadow of </strong><strong><i>The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, Atwood has said that for personal and political reasons, she&#8217;d hoped that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">would fade into irrelevance. She hoped its dark visions, and grim political scenarios, would drift far apart from present-day reality.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But no such luck. The book&#8212;listed as the most highly read novel on Amazon in 2017&#8212;remains a constant political touchstone.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book is making headlines all over again, now that Amy Coney Barrett is favored to be President Trump&#8217;s nominee to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barrett is said to be a member of the People of Praise group, which is similar to a patriarchal church organization that was one of the inspirations for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale.&#160;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atwood emphasized that it was not, in fact, the People of Praise who inspired her book.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t them. It was a different one but the same idea,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also cautioned listeners to not place religious groups automatically in &#8220;the bad box," because there are evangelical groups who believe racial equality is a faith issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What happened with a certain kind of right-wing Christian evangelical is they misinterpreted the Bible,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Love your neighbor means no matter what your perceived differences may be. And these people are not loving their neighbors.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handmaid&#8217;s Tale</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was published 36 years ago, the Iron Curtain was still in place. The Berlin Wall was still standing. At the time, &#8220;the United States was seen as a beacon of light, freedom, free speech, a society dedicated to equality &#8230; And people really didn&#8217;t want to believe, especially in Europe, that such a country could ever turn and go in the opposite direction," Atwood said. "But having looked back in history, you can&#8217;t ever say, &#8216;It can&#8217;t happen here.&#8217; Because anything could happen anywhere given the circumstances.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, &#8220;people were saying, &#8216;It&#8217;s the end of history.&#8217; Wrong. And, 'What do women want? Women have already gotten everything they want.' Wrong," Atwood said. "Then we hit 9/11. It turned out history wasn&#8217;t over. It was just taking a different turn. Then we hit 2008, the financial meltdown, and that made people more scared, and when people turn more scared, what they want is stability. They want safety. And they are willing to trade stuff for it. So here we are!&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the book is frequently invoked in discussions about reproductive rights and the control over the bodies and the destinies of everyone who lives in Gilead, the totalitarian patriarchal theocracy that rules over most of the territory that belonged to the former continental United States in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Handmaid's Tale</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In response to a reader who recently asked about the potential rollback of abortion rights in 24 states if </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roe v. Wade</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is overtuned, Atwood did not mince words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Suppose that women are forced to have children they don&#8217;t want to have? What is the equivalent of that? The draft. The state controls men&#8217;s bodies ... but you get a salary, food, clothing, lodging, and frequently an education," she said. "If you are going to conscript women&#8217;s bodies in that way, you should offer them all those things, and pay for that, if you&#8217;re really serious about it. Otherwise you&#8217;re just going to get orphanages, dead babies, baby snatching, all the things that dial back the calendar.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>A return to Gilead</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, her dystopian books also have a strong undercurrent of resilience and resistance, especially </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Testaments</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, her 2019 sequel to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which has a subplot involving a major character who is part of the repressive Republic of Gilead regime but later undermines it by leaking devastating information to the outside world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In writing the book, Atwood found inspiration in the real-life stories of acquaintances who had fought in resistance efforts in World War II in Poland, France, and Holland.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one of her questions to the author, Schatz referenced Atwood&#8217;s uncanny ability to predict and assess frightening trends and currents, and her refusal to incorporate any details in her dystopian novels that don&#8217;t have some real-life correlation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It has to have had a precedent,&#8221; Atwood said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Hope in the humanities</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her dialogue with Schatz, Atwood often invoked the power of the humanities to help beleaguered humans address problems ranging from climate change to the insidious creeping of authoritarianism. In Atwood&#8217;s view, the various disciplines of the humanities&#8212;from the close study of history and literature to the rigors of philosophy&#8212;are a path forward in times of chaos.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Atwood noted that humans now have the wherewithal to &#8220;turn this ship around&#8221; to address the climate crisis, which she linked to wars, mass migrations, and pandemics of the past. Atwood mentioned the far-ranging work of Project Drawdown, a nonprofit organization formed to avert climate disasters of the future.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are a lot of people working on (climate change solutions),&#8221; Atwood noted. &#8220;The problem is will. It can be done. Will we do it? Will we do it on time? It is a people thing. And that brings us right into the humanities.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event was part of </span><a href="http://thi.ucsc.edu/deepread/"><strong><i>The Deep Read</i></strong></a><strong><i>,</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a new program by The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz that invites readers to engage deeply about literature, art, and the most pressing issues of our day.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was originally scheduled for April 5 on campus, but safety concerns forced a postponement and a format change to an online talk.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c60e99fe8072701763b3cba6ff630e05"><name>mendoza-emmy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumna Martha Mendoza wins Emmy for work on child detention documentary</title><summary>‘Kids Caught in the Crackdown’ documentary from PBS Frontline and Associated Press investigates the detention of migrant children in federally-funded shelters.</summary><start-date>1601017200000</start-date><display-name>Alumna Martha Mendoza wins Emmy for work on child detention documentary</display-name><path>/2020/09/mendoza-emmy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/09/mendoza-emmy</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1601050679780</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1601050932417</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Science Communication Program</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/09/images/martha-mendoza-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/09/images/martha-mendoza-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>martha-mendoza-300.jpg</name><display-name>martha-mendoza-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>56749</file-size><width>300</width><height>396</height></image><image-alt>Martha Mendoza</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/09/images/martha-mendoza-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/09/images/martha-mendoza-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>martha-mendoza-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>martha-mendoza-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>13713</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Martha Mendoza</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Martha Mendoza</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>‘Kids Caught in the Crackdown’ documentary from PBS Frontline and Associated Press investigates detention of migrant children in federally-funded shelters</article-subhead><article-text><p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">UC Santa Cruz alumna Martha Mendoza, an investigative reporter with the Associated Press and a lecturer in the UCSC Science Communication Program, has added an Emmy Award to her two Pulitzer Prizes and other honors. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Mendoza (Kresge &#8217;88, independent major, journalism and education) and fellow AP reporter Garance Burke worked with PBS Frontline on a joint investigation of the treatment of migrant children, which included the film &#8220;Kids Caught in the Crackdown.&#8221; The team won the Emmy for Outstanding Continuing Coverage of a News Story in a Newsmagazine in the 41st annual News and Documentary Emmy Awards. The winners were announced September 21.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Mendoza began collaborating with Burke on the project last year, and they published a series of stories about the treatment of migrant children, their detention inside federally-funded shelters, and the lasting impacts on children held in U.S. custody. &#8220;Kids Caught in the Crackdown&#8221; aired on PBS on November 12, 2019. The documentary and related news stories are available online at </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/kids-caught-in-the-crackdown/"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">pbs.org</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Mendoza&#8217;s investigative reports have won numerous awards and prompted Congressional hearings, Pentagon investigations, and White House responses. She won her first Pulitzer Prize in 2000 for investigative reporting as part of an AP team that revealed the slaughter by American soldiers of hundreds of civilians at the No Gun Ri bridge early in the Korean War. In 2016, she won another Pulitzer Prize (the Gold Medal for Public Service) as part of an AP team that exposed the use of slave labor in the Thai seafood industry.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Dear Campus Colleagues:</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The 2020 UC Women&#8217;s Initiative for Professional Development (UC WI) Program is now accepting nominations.&#160;UC WI is a unique professional development program designed to help women identified professionals advance in their UC careers. Endorsed by the President's Office and the Systemwide Advisory Committee on the Status of Women (SACSW), it was developed by Systemwide Human Resources through our Talent Management division.&#160; UC WI is committed to enabling the full participation, success, and advancement of women identified professionals at the University.&#160;&#160;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The program is open to all who seek to support this mission and who are interested in their own development and supporting the advancement of others. UC WI also creates the unique opportunity for faculty, academic personnel and staff to interact together. As the UC Santa Cruz Location Coordinator, I ask for your active engagement to identify, nominate, encourage and sponsor mid-career faculty, academic personnel, and staff to benefit from this experiential professional development opportunity.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The UC WI is a four-session program designed in collaboration between SACSW and Systemwide Talent Management, and is delivered by Coro, a non-profit leadership development organization.&#160;</span></span></p>

<p>The Women in Supply Chain award honors female supply chain leaders and executives whose accomplishments, mentorship and examples set a foundation for women in all levels of a company&#8217;s supply chain network.</p>
<p>&#8220;We received over 200 entries for this new award, entries that were submitted from a combination of men and women. This proves that our industry needed an award like this, especially in conjunction with <em>Supply &amp; Demand Chain Executive&#8217;s</em> 20-year anniversary,&#8221; said Marina Mayer, editor-in-chief of <em>Supply &amp; Demand Chain Executive</em> and <em>Food Logistics</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to Gartner&#8217;s 2020 Women in Supply Chain Survey, 17 percent of chief supply chain officers are now women &#8211; a 6 percent increase compared to 2019. This award represents females supporting other female leaders; men supporting their female counterparts,: Mayer said. "It recognizes the future and it represents growth, evolution and community. And, that future shows that it&#8217;s a great time to be a part of the supply chain industry. So, congratulations to these top female leaders. I look forward to seeing what else you do to grow the supply chain industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 2020 Women in Supply Chain award is in SDCE&#8217;s September issue.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d55768bc8072701763b3cba6c3c64720"><name>seed-funding</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Seed funding grants support plans for innovative research centers</title><summary>The UCSC Office of Research has awarded seed funding to six campus research groups to support their efforts to develop innovative new research centers. </summary><keywords>Scott Brandt</keywords><start-date>1601276400000</start-date><display-name>Seed funding grants support plans for innovative research centers</display-name><path>/2020/09/seed-funding</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2020/09/seed-funding</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1601307109536</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1601307224160</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>News Briefs</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/09/images/seed-program-logo.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/09/images/seed-program-logo.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>seed-program-logo.jpg</name><display-name>seed-program-logo.jpg</display-name><file-size>42314</file-size><width>326</width><height>280</height></image><image-alt>seed funding program logo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/09/images/seed-program-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/09/images/seed-program-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>seed-program-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>seed-program-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16453</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>seed funding program logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UCSC Office of Research has awarded seed funding to six campus research groups to support their efforts to develop innovative new research centers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/ord/seed-initiatives.html">Seed Funding for Center Scale Research Initiatives</a> program supports collaborative, multidisciplinary proposals and aims to bring together faculty with diverse backgrounds, areas of inquiry, and expertise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal with this program is to make strategic investments in collaborative and multidisciplinary projects that will lead to innovative, inventive, and serendipitous discoveries and findings with big impacts and significant long-term funding,&#8221; said Scott Brandt, vice chancellor for research. &#8220;Each of these projects meets these criteria and we are very excited to see what they will produce going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first cohort of awards includes the following groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>"An Interdisciplinary Research Network for Astrobiology at UCSC," led by Natalie Batalha, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, explores new models of planetary development and how it could lead to the conditions for life, and furthers our understanding of the prevalence of life in the universe.</li>
<li>"Developing a Collaborative, Interdisciplinary Center Research Proposal for Energy-efficient Magnetoelectronics," led by David Lederman, professor of physics, will design 2-dimensional material layered stacks to precisely control performance properties such as magnetism and superconductivity at the quantum scale for future microelectronics.</li>
<li>"The Applied Artificial Intelligence Initiative," led by J. Xavier Prochaska, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, will continue to build bridges across disciplines and between industry, academia, and under-represented minorities to develop UCSC as a leader in the growing field of artificial intelligence.</li>
<li>"Building Resilience to Climate Change in Crops with Artificial Intelligence and AgTech Devices," led by Marco Rolandi, professor of electrical and computer engineering, will use bioelectronic devices paired with AI algorithms that can regulate specific plant hormones to increase agricultural yields and crop resilience.</li>
<li>"Computation-Aware Algorithmic Design for Cyber-Physical Systems for Intelligent Transportation," led by Ricardo Sanfelice, professor of electrical and computer engineering, will build a framework for merging feedback control algorithms with computing system designs to reduce operational risks and optimize performance for intelligent transportation systems and other cyber-physical systems.</li>
<li>"UCSC Center for Open Access Splicing Therapeutics (COAST)," led by Michael Stone, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, will pursue meaningful precision therapies for patients with rare diseases. The COAST team will leverage their ribonucleic acid (RNA) expertise to intervene with small populations where the medical industry cannot make cost effective treatments economically viable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each group will use their seed funding over the next year to pursue center-scale research proposals. The awards of $60,000 to $75,000 provide support for grant planning, capacity building, research development activities, and acquisition of key data.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d565adf98072701763b3cba660ffbd1f"><name>wildfire-in-wilder-ranch</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Wildfire in Wilder Ranch</title><summary>CalFire and Santa Cruz fire agencies are fighting a wildfire that is about a mile north of campus in Wilder Ranch.

Faculty catching up with students they haven&#8217;t seen since spring. Staff doing the million things they do so well to keep UC Santa Cruz strong. That&#8217;s what I think about when I envision the annual start of the academic year. But this year, which starts Thursday, things will look very different, and I want to share with the community how we&#8217;re approaching the fall quarter amid a global pandemic.<br/><br/>Our campus is taking an extremely conservative tack, among the most conservative in the country. Of the roughly 1,500 courses we will offer this quarter, only six will be held on campus, comprising just 54 students. The rest will be offered remotely, with students logging in to classes from wherever they are located.<br/><br/>We have vastly reduced the number of students who will be living on campus. In a typical year, we would house roughly 9,000 students. This fall, that number will be about 1,000; these students either do not have alternative housing available or living arrangements conducive to remote instruction. Except for family-student housing, the majority of housing assignments are singles &#8212; one person per room. Students are being asked to sequester for their first 14 days on campus. Residence hall bathrooms have been reconfigured to promote physical distancing. All campus dining will be takeout only.<br/><br/>After the CZU August Lightning Complex fire destroyed 925 area homes and damaged another 100, we asked students who might be planning to live in the community this year to consider remaining at home.<br/><br/>Why such a conservative approach? Because we care deeply about the well-being of our students, staff, faculty, and the greater Santa Cruz community. The best guidance we have been able to gather suggests that opening for in-person classes this fall would be unwise, the risk of COVID-19 exposure and spread too high. We did not want to find ourselves in the position that some colleges and universities now find themselves in: opening for in-person instruction, then abruptly changing course in the face of COVID-19 outbreaks.<br/><br/>Testing is also a major component of our campus COVID-19 mitigation plan. We worked hard this spring to add a diagnostic testing lab to campus. The lab will allow us to do asymptotic testing of those who are required to be on campus. Students in campus housing will be tested twice weekly. Our student health center works with the lab when contact tracing, allowing rapid testing of potential contacts to avert outbreaks. We also are providing COVID-19 testing at cost to local nonprofit health-care providers &#8212; currently about 200 samples per week with a capacity of closer to 400. We believe a healthier community helps us all.<br/><br/>Finally, as the year starts, we are launching a proactive campaign called Slug Strong that promotes the actions each of us can take personally to protect our community, chief among them physical distancing, wearing a mask, and avoiding large gatherings.<br/><br/>Is any of this ideal? No. I wish this school year could unfurl like previous ones. I feel for students who want to be on campus, the faculty who want to teach them in person, and the staff and faculty juggling both work and child-care duties from home. I also sympathize with the many local merchants who depend on our students to remain in business. These are difficult times. This will not last forever, though, and I am hopeful that it will soon be just a memory. But until then, I believe these measures are best for our campus and our community.<br/><br/>Cynthia Larive is the chancellor of UC Santa Cruz.</div></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dab3cf268072701763b3cba65935dca1"><name>joint-statement-on-pan-african-research-fellowships</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Joint Statement on Pan-African Research Fellowships</title><summary>On June 2, the Black Student Union at UC Santa Cruz wrote an open letter entitled “The Unrelenting Anti-Blackness of 2020” to advocate for transformational change that addresses anti-Blackness and inequity on the UCSC campus.

<ul>
<li>Establish an Office of ABC Student Success. The activities and work of the Office of ABC Student Success will span all areas of the student experience, and will be housed in the Division of Student Affairs and Success. The Advocate for ABC Student Success will report directly to the interim Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Success.</li>
<li>Perform a review of the cultural competency capacity in CAPS and ensure that appointment and practitioner capacity exist to meet the needs of ABC, Muslim and LGBTQIA+ students seeking support.</li>

<p>In a video published today, Chancellor Cynthia Larive, interim Vice Chancellor Jennifer Baszile, SUA President Shivika Sivakumar, college provosts, resource center directors and the president of the UC Santa Cruz alumni council welcomed new Banana Slugs to their college journey.</p>
<p>"This is the start of your academic journey and it's important to get the most from the experience. Soon enough, we'll all come back together again in person," Chancellor Cynthia Larive said.</p>

<p>Student Union Assembly President Shivika Sivakumar recalled how eager she was to explore all of UC Santa Cruz's opportuntiies when she enrolled two years ago.&#160;</p>
<p>"This year&#8212;this time right now&#8212;is the opportunity for you to pursue your passion, to create a difference, to make a positive impact," Sivakumar said. "You're not alone in this. We're in this together. We will build community we will support one another. We will stay resilient and then we will do this together.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz college system and the core courses they offer are two of the defining elements of the undergraduate experience.</p>
<p>"The colleges are giving you a foundation for your liberal arts education," Kresge College Provost Ben Leeds Carson said. "No matter what your expertise is, your liberal arts education means you find a bird's eye view. You are the one who can lead by helping experts talk to one another."</p>
<p>In addition to the educational experience, the colleges are about building community, Oakes College Provost Marcia Ochoa said.</p>
<p>"Students come to UC Santa Cruz and identify with their college and make friendships that last an entire lifetime," Ochoa said. "The college is a place where we really hope you start to feel at home at UC Santa Cruz, where you have people who you can turn to to lift you up if you're having a bad day or help answer your questions."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="daf4e9c08072701763b3cba6984f897a"><name>cool-school</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Focused on sustainability, UC Santa Cruz among Sierra's top 25 'Cool Schools'</title><summary>The campus, No. 21 on Sierra's ranking, earned distinction for research, curriculum, and transportation. &#13;

<p>The campus, <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/cool-schools-2020/cool-schools-2020-full-ranking">No. 21 on the list</a>, earned distinction for research, curriculum, and transportation.</p>
<p>Sierra magazine has been ranking universities for 13 years, and more than 300 schools participated this year. Sierra noted that its ranking focuses on what universities offer "the best sustainability-focused courses, ecofriendly cafeteria provisions, and carbon-neutral land and energy policies, as well as the most opportunities to engage with the environmental movement."</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz&#8212;like all UCs&#8212;will be phasing out single-use plastics as part of a bold commitment to achieve zero waste. The new policy will transition UC away from plastic bags in retail and dining locations and eventually eliminate single-use plastic food service items and plastic bottles.</p>
<p>The UC also instituted a system-wide ban on expanded plastic foam packaging (aka: "styrofoam") that went into effect January 1, 2020. For more information on how to do your part in helping UCSC eliminate styrofoam, please visit <a href="https://sustainability.ucsc.edu/. ">https://sustainability.ucsc.edu/. </a></p>
<p>"UCSC continues to prioritize sustainable practices and plastics reduction, even in these unprecedented times," said Elida Erickson, director of sustainability. "Increased sanitation measures do <em>not</em> have to result in an increase in single-use plastics. EH&amp;S was quick to initiate sanitizer bottle refill programs early on in the university's COVID-19 response, and Dining Services will explore alternatives to single-use for its on-the-go meals program in future academic quarters.

His research interests include high-energy astrophysics, dark matter searches, particle physics beyond the Standard Model, and the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe.</p>
<p>The APS recognized Profumo &#8220;for incisive contributions to the development of astroparticle physics. In particular, for work addressing many aspects of dark matter theory and detection, including direct and indirect detection, as well as collider searches.&#8221;</p>
<p>Narayan&#8217;s research interests include theoretical condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics of disordered and nonequilibrium systems. The APS citation recognized him &#8220;for definitive work correcting the Fourier law of thermal transport below 2D, and for wide ranging contributions to statistical mechanics of granular systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Election as an APS Fellow is a distinct honor signifying recognition by one's professional peers. Each year, no more than one half of one percent of the APS membership is recognized by their peers for election to the status of Fellow of the American Physical Society.</p>
<p>The American Physical Society is a nonprofit membership organization working to advance the knowledge of physics. APS represents over 55,000 members, including physicists in academia, national laboratories, and industry in the United States and throughout the world.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e0c1c4bc807270177ac7b973fef4122a"><name>adobe-creative-cloud-available-to-ucsc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Adobe Creative Cloud Available to UCSC</title><summary>Exciting News!

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgie DeAntoni knelt in the ashes of what had once been a home on Jamison Road in Boulder Creek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day was hot and the 26-year-old fifth-year UC Santa Cruz anthropology Ph.D. candidate sweltered in her Tyvek suit and mask. Using a small hand trowel, she sifted through the gray rubble as part of a team of volunteers sent out by the Alta Heritage Foundation of Santa Rosa that included several archaeologists plus five specially trained dogs and their handlers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team was looking for the cremated remains of Sue and Mike Fortwengler, which had inadvertently been left behind when their daughter, Heidi McFarland, and her family fled the fast-moving CZU Lightning Complex fire.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a little like searching for a needle in a haystack. The couple&#8217;s ashes had been in two urns on top of an armoire but now were mixed with the fire-charred remains of a home: drywall, wood, books, furniture.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But DeAntoni, who is doing archaeological research at a Native Californian site in San Juan Bautista for her dissertation, was especially suited for the task.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Archaeologists are weirdly trained to do this kind of thing,&#8221; DeAntoni said in a telephone interview from her Burlingame home. They are taught to look for micro-changes in the soil as they painstakingly peel back layers of dirt to help identify things like a wall, a trash pit, a cooking area. In a fire, cremated remains will look different than other burned substances. They are grittier with bits of bone and teeth mixed in. Often, depending on what burned with them, they will also turn a different color than the ash around them&#8212;pinkish salmon, brown, and sometimes even a golden hue&#8212;which helps a trained eye to spot them.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For DeAntoni, it was a way to be of service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the nice things about our program,&#8221; said Tsim Schneider, assistant professor of anthropology at UC Santa Cruz, &#8220;is that we all share a common ground in terms of an interest in students getting a practical training in their work. In my own teaching I also try to instill this idea of public-facing archeology. The idea that we don&#8217;t just do research for research's sake but we actually do good outside of our laboratory and field settings.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>Left behind</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McFarland didn&#8217;t realize she&#8217;d forgotten her parents&#8217; ashes until days after she and her family had fled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her father and mother had died one year apart in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Her dad, Mike, was a cancer survivor and was named an American Red Cross Hero for his volunteer work with cancer patients. And, even though he and McFarland&#8217;s mother Sue had divorced, when she was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer&#8217;s at the age of 50, he moved back in and became her caregiver for more than a decade, McFarland said. Her mother called him her &#8220;was-band.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike was 79 when he died. Sue was 73.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McFarland couldn&#8217;t stand the idea that her parents&#8217; ashes would be scooped up and tossed in a toxic-waste dump with the rest of the ruined house.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s often the story, according to Lynne Engelbert, a dog trainer and long-time member of the Institute for Canine Forensics, which works with the nonprofit Alta Heritage Foundation. She and her dogs, she said, have searched for remains at the World Trade Center, the Oklahoma City bombing site, and as part of the Columbia Space Shuttle recovery mission. She also has searched for dozens of lost cremains in the Camp, Woolsey, Carr, and Tubbs fires.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already, dozens of requests have poured into the Alta Heritage Foundation from homeowners who lost their loved ones&#8217; cremains in the fires that ravaged Oregon and California, Engelbert said. The majority of expenses are covered by the volunteers themselves. The service itself is free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In so many cases, people are literally running for their lives,&#8221; said Engelbert from her Saratoga home office. They may have only 15 or 20 minutes to leave, and grabbing the cremated remains of their husband or wife or parents or child is not usually the first thing on their minds. Later, however, sadness and guilt start to seep in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The thought that their loved ones&#8217; cremains might wind up in a toxic waste dump is devastating,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They say: &#8216;I can&#8217;t bear to have Dad end up in a dump.&#8217;&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h3>Detective work</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work is straightforward but painstaking and sometimes dangerous. Trainers&#8212;there were five dogs on site during the recent searches of three ruined homes in the Santa Cruz Mountains&#8212;are given an approximate location of the lost cremains. After a safety assessment looking for anything that might harm the dogs, a canine is sent into the search area.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trained to sniff out human bone, the canines will sit or lie down when an area of cremated remains is found, said Engelbert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our dogs love what they do,&#8221; Engelbert said. &#8220;They get out there and are given rewards when they find things: a treat or a tug or a ball. Whatever they love, you give it to them. My dog (a 10-year-old black-and-white border collie named Piper) will kill for a rolled-up towel.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volunteer archaeologists like DeAntoni and recent UC Santa Cruz anthropology grad Adriano Odello (Cowell '20) and others then begin their search in the area the dogs pinpointed. It took an hour before DeAntoni and the other archeologists were able to locate the cremains of both Sue and Mike at McFarland&#8217;s ruined home. However, the fall from the top of the armoire had mingled the two sets of ashes with no way to separate them&#8212;a fact McFarland said her parents wouldn&#8217;t have minded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s very significant to be able to know I can put my mother&#8217;s ashes at rest in a place where she wanted instead of being scooped up and taken to some hazardous waste dump,&#8221; McFarland said. &#8220;To me, it was a huge blessing to have that peace of mind.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for DeAntoni, she&#8217;d like to volunteer for the program again.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is one of the ways archeology can be of service,&#8221; DeAntoni said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a science that&#8217;s interesting but it doesn&#8217;t always help people. I felt this is a place where we are trained to do something that benefits our community.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why do I do it?&#8221; Engelbert said in response to a question. &#8220;I tell people I do it because I&#8217;m selfish. I love it when I can help someone who needs it the most &#8230;. If you can help a family bring some type of closure to (something like a fire or terrorist attack), there is no greater feeling, and that&#8217;s why I do it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The Clery Act&#8212;named by Congress in honor of 19-year-old Jeanne Clery, a Lehigh University student who was raped and killed in her dorm room&#8212;requires colleges and universities to disclose their security policies, keep a public crime log, publish an annual crime report, and provide timely warnings to students and campus employees about a crime posing an immediate or ongoing threat to students and campus employees.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The report contains information regarding campus security and personal safety including topics such as: crime prevention, fire safety, university police law enforcement authority, crime reporting policies, disciplinary procedures, and other matters of importance related to security and safety on campus. It also contains information about crime statistics for the three previous calendar years concerning reported crimes that occurred on campus; in certain off-campus buildings or property owned or controlled by UC Santa Cruz; and on public property within, or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Fire Safety</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The deadly wildfires throughout California, and especially the recent CZU Complex Fire in Santa Cruz County and confirmed as the 10th most destructive fire in California history, serves as a reminder that we all need to do our part to prevent wildfires. The impacts of the CZU Complex Fire were so severe that the campus was forced to evacuate staff, faculty and students for the first time in the campus's 55 year history. Fortunately, the fire never reached the campus and occupancy was quickly restored. Anyone who smells smoke or sees a fire must not hesitate to dial 911.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Section 4421 of the Public Resources Code states that no person shall set fire or cause fire to be set to any forest, brush, or other flammable material which is on any land that is not his/her own, or under his/her legal control, without the permission of the owner, lessee, or agent of the owner or lessee of the land.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Information about registered sex offenders</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Pursuant to the Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act, institutions of higher education must annually provide the campus community with how law enforcement agency information concerning registered sex offenders may be obtained.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The State of California requires sex offenders to register with the police department in the jurisdiction in which they reside. The state makes this information available to law enforcement agencies. This information is available to the public at the local police/sheriff's department. For the UC Santa Cruz campus, information on registered sex offenders is available at the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office, 701 Ocean St., Santa Cruz, CA 95060, 831-454-2242.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Additionally, the Federal Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act provides for the tracking of convicted sex offenders enrolled at or employed at institutions of higher education.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>California Penal Code &#167;290.01 requires sex offenders who are enrolled as a student, or is, with or without compensation, a full-time or part-time employee, or is carrying on a vocation for more than 14 days, or for an aggregate period exceeding 30 days in a calendar year to register with the UC Santa Cruz Police Department within five working days of commencing enrollment or employment. The terms "employed or carries on a vocation" include employment whether or not financially compensated, volunteered, or performed for government or educational benefit. The registrant shall also notify the UC Santa Cruz Police Department within five working days of ceasing to be enrolled or employed, or ceasing to carry on a vocation.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Information on these registered sex offenders is available to the public on the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://meganslaw.ca.gov/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1601652640301000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG7wa3YdXd7MUkqt8aMVgRnXNrYqg" href="http://meganslaw.ca.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Megan's Law website</span></a><span>.</span></p>
