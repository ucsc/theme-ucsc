The decision to expand the '502' prefix to include faculty and staff was prompted by the depletion of 459-xxxx phone numbers.</p><p>If you currently have a campus phone number beginning with the prefix '459' your number will remain the same and not change. In addition, dialing campus extensions will not change.</p><p>The only change you will notice is that some faculty and staff will have office phone numbers that begin with the '502' prefix in addition to the existing 459-xxxx numbers.</p><p>Within campus, an example number will be:</p><p>502-1234, dial extension 2-1234</p><p>or</p><p>459-1234, dial extension 9-1234.</p><p>If you have any questions, please contact the ITS Support Center at 459-4357.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Information Technology Services (ITS)</p><p>Phone: (831) 459-4357</p><p><a href="http://its.ucsc.edu">http://its.ucsc.edu</a></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Faculty and Staff</audience><admin>Information Technology Services (ITS)</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9151ad1d8072704601a012ff5871963d"><name>1251</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz research team sheds light on diet of early human ancestors</title><summary>The diet of early human ancestors probably included bulbs and rhizomes, according to researchers at UC Santa Cruz who have shed new light on a conundrum that has puzzled anthropologists for eight years.</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>dominy, hominin, diet, anthropology, koch</keywords><description>The diet of early human ancestors probably included bulbs and rhizomes, according to researchers at UC Santa Cruz who have shed new light on a conundrum that has puzzled anthropologists for eight years.</description><start-date>1178002800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz research...</display-name><path>/2007/05/1251</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/05/1251</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338303172</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338303172</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Anthropology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/05/images/rat.220.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/05/images/rat.220.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rat.220.jpg</name><file-size>39886</file-size><width>220</width><height>119</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>African mole rats eat a diet rich in bulbs.

Photo by Jennifer McNulty.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Eight years ago, the field of anthropology was rocked by isotopic evidence that suggested one-third of the diet of early human ancestors consisted of grasses and sedges, or the tissue of animals that ate such plants. The news puzzled scientists, who were unable to reconcile the results with what they knew about the teeth of human ancestors who lived more than 2 million years ago.</p><p>However, an experiment by a team of researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, suggests that consumption of bulbs and other underground parts of plants, rather than grasses, produced the puzzling isotopic evidence. They report their results in a paper titled "The Isotopic Ecology of African Mole Rats Informs Hypotheses on the Evolution of Human Diet," which appears in the current online issue of the <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</i>.</p><p>The flat, thickly enameled molars of early humans have led scientists to infer that their diet consisted primarily of hard, brittle foods, such as seeds. But in light of recent findings, researchers speculated that a diet of corms, bulbs, rhizomes, and tubers of plants that use a form of photosynthesis that produces the same isotopic signature as grasses and sedges, could resolve the conundrum. </p><p>The UCSC team tested the hypothesis by analyzing stable carbon and oxygen isotopes of the bone and tooth enamel of African mole rats, small tunneling rodents that eat primarily corms, bulbs, rhizomes, and tubers, otherwise known as plant underground storage organs (USOs). The team also analyzed the fossil remains of mole rats recovered from the same locations where <i>Australopithecus africanus</i> and <i>Paranthropus robustus</i> were discovered and found sufficient overlap between the isotopic signatures to support their contention that early human ancestors, like African mole rats, ate a diet rich in USOs.</p><p>"This study certainly adds to the body of evidence that the diet of early hominins included bulbs and corms, and possibly tubers," said Nathaniel J. Dominy, assistant professor of anthropology, who was joined in the project by Paul L. Koch, professor of Earth and planetary sciences; lead author Justin D. Yeakel, a Ph.D. candidate in anthropology; and Nigel C. Bennett, professor of zoology at the University of Pretoria, South Africa.</p><p>The ratios of carbon and oxygen isotopes reveal clues to both the dietary proclivities of animals and aspects of the environment they inhabit. "By comparing the isotopic results of modern animals with known diets to fossil species, we can begin to infer the foraging ecologies of extinct populations of animals," said Yeakel.</p><p>Early humans would have encountered little competition for underground plant foods, noted Dominy. "African mole rats are small animals that forage mostly by luck, whereas bush pigs are largely nocturnal," he said. "Our early human ancestors had the advantage of a relatively large brain to help recognize specific plants and to make simple tools for extracting USOs from the ground." Importantly, he noted, the metabolic costs of a large brain would have been nourished by a diet of USOs, which are rich in carbohydrates.</p><p>The findings appear to resolve the conundrum posed by the grasses and sedges hypothesis. "The classic way to infer diet is to look at the teeth because form follows function. Hominins had teeth like ours, which were designed to eat something really, really hard, like small seeds, not tough grasses or raw meat," said Dominy. "Mechanically, our teeth are poorly suited for chewing such tough foods." Adding to the consternation was a lack of evidence of habitual meat consumption more than 1.9 million years ago. </p><p>Dominy's team's findings also provide significant new information about the diet of early humans, which is central to understanding human evolution. "We don't know exactly what hominins ate, but diet controls everything--locomotion, social organization, and reproduction," said Dominy. "Something about our ancestors' diet shifted to favor them becoming bipedal and increasingly brainy. No other organism on the planet evolved that way."</p><p>The research was supported by the American Philosophical Society, the UCSC Committee on Research, the UCSC Division of Social Sciences, the Wenner-Gren Foundation, and a grant from the National Science Foundation.</p><p>#####</p><p>Note to journalists: Dominy may be reached at njdominy@ucsc.edu or (831) 459-2541; Yeakel may be reached at jyeakel@pmc.ucsc.edu. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9151aeca8072704601a012fff6045725"><name>1252</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Message from Vice Provost, Larry Merkley - CruzMail Update</title><start-date>1178089200000</start-date><display-name>Message from Vice Provost,...</display-name><path>/2007/05/1252</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/05/1252</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338303641</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338303641</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I write to update you on recent developments regarding our CruzMail email system.

Francis, executive director and chief medical officer of Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases, will discuss "Confronting Deadly Epidemics Around the World" in a free public lecture at UC Santa Cruz on Tuesday, May 22. Part of the Distinguished Lecture Series marking the 10th anniversary of UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering, the talk will take place at 4 p.m. in the Simularium (Room 180) of the Engineering 2 Building on the UCSC campus. </p><p>In his talk, Dr. Francis will discuss the approaches used to understand and control outbreaks of deadly infectious diseases. The tools available for control vary widely depending on the disease. Ebola is one of the most dangerous infections of humans, yet there are few tools available to control it other than simple isolation of infectious patients. At the other extreme are diseases such as smallpox and polio, for which safe and effective vaccines are available.</p><p>A pediatrician and epidemiologist specializing in infectious diseases, Dr. Francis has over 30 years experience in epidemic control and vaccines. He spent 21 years working for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), focusing on vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, cholera, smallpox, and hepatitis B. He directed the World Health Organization's Smallpox Eradication Program in Sudan and northern India and was a member of the WHO team investigating the world's first outbreak of Ebola virus in 1976. </p><p>Dr. Francis has worked on HIV/AIDS since its emergence in 1981. He initially directed the AIDS laboratory at the CDC and later spent almost 7 years developing and assessing HIV prevention programs in the United States. His early efforts to call attention to the threat of AIDS and warn of the inadequacy of the public health response were chronicled in <i>And the Band Played On,</i> journalist Randy Shilts's account of the early years of the AIDS epidemic.</p><p>Since his retirement from the CDC in 1992, Dr. Francis has focused on vaccine development. He helped found the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, worked on HIV vaccines at Genentech, and started a new company, VaxGen, to focus on HIV vaccine development. He left VaxGen, where he had served as president, in early 2004 to cofound Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases along with Phillip Berman, now professor and chair of biomolecular engineering at UCSC.</p><p>Dr. Francis earned his bachelor's degree at UC Berkeley, his M.D. at Northwestern University, and a D.Sc. at Harvard University.</p><p>For more information about this lecture, call (831) 459-2158 or e-mail drecept@soe.ucsc.edu.

The lecture will take place at 4 p.m. on Thursday, May 17, in the Current Periodicals Room of the Science &amp; Engineering Library. Light refreshments will be available.</p>
<p>Mangel will address the issue of why we age (or why we live as long as we do) and will explain some fundamental concepts in demography concerning lifespan. He will also explain why aging is the inevitable outcome of natural selection and that, even so, aging itself can evolve.</p>
<p>The mechanism of aging can be understood as the accumulation of damage to molecules, cells, and tissues that express themselves in mortality and declining physiological capacity. Anti-aging intervention takes three possible routes: avoiding causes of premature death, making various kinds of dietary changes, and applying nanomedicine technologies to repair damage. Mangel will explain why the effects of these interventions on human lifespan are not clear.</p>

The garden, featuring plants with pleasant and interesting aromas, is designed to appeal as much to the nose as to the eyes.</p><p>"The outstanding design of the garden by Silver Tree Designs allows close interaction with the collections and every opportunity to take a pinch and sniff," said Arboretum director Daniel Harder. "When you visit, explore this garden with your nose and look beyond the flowers to locate the source of the aroma."</p><p>Visitors can rub leaves between their fingers and elicit odors ranging from perfume-inspiring flowers to mints and pungent herbs. The flowers were chosen for their pleasant aromas. What each person smells may differ, however, because of human genetic differences. For example, one of the most fragrant shrubs in the garden is the inconspicuous <i>Boronia megastigma,</i> which some people think smells better than candy, while others don't seem to be able to smell it at all. </p><p>At a later date, signs will be added explaining the role of fragrances in attracting pollinators and deterring herbivores. Several garden sculptures on loan from local sculptors decorate places designed into the garden. Massive, decorative pots donated by Pottery Planet contain more herbs and complement the sculptures and hardscape design. Most of the plants were donated by local nurseries and growers.</p><p>The garden renovation was made possible thanks to a challenge fund provided by Elspeth Bobbs, a longtime supporter of the Arboretum. Not coincidentally, the Aroma Garden is directly across from the Arboretum's gift shop, Norrie's, which was donated by Mrs. Bobbs in the early 1990s. Additional Aroma Garden sponsorships are still available.</p><p>The Arboretum is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day free of charge. Norrie's Gifts is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. For more information, call (831) 427-2998 or visit the Arboretum <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu">web site</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9151b5368072704601a012ff8585ec8b"><name>1256</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC hosting NCAA DIII men's tennis, women's water polo championships</title><summary>The NCAA Division III Men's Tennis team championship will take place at UCSC May 4 - 6 at the east tennis courts.

<p>The series will present folk, blues, and roots concerts on the third Thursdays of the month, from May through October. Performers this year include legendary folksinger Utah Phillips, acclaimed Celtic band Molly's Revenge, acoustic blues master Alvin Youngblood Hart, Son De Madera--performing traditional music and dance from Mexico, and ukulele virtuoso Jake Shimabukuro.</p>
<p>All shows begin at 6:30 p.m. and gates open at 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p>The 2007 lineup:</p>
<p><strong>May 17 -- Alejandro Escovedo (duo)</strong></p>
<p>By way of southern California, this Texas-based singer/songwriter has been creating and bending musical genres for more than 20 years. Escovedo is from a musically gifted family--his brother is Latin-jazz legend Pete Escovedo and he is the uncle of jazz-soul artist Sheila E. Alejandro, however, took to a different form of music: rock &amp; roll. His seventh solo release, <em>The Boxing Mirror,</em> was produced by musical visionary John Cale.</p>
<p><strong>June 21st -- Utah Phillips (Solo/Folk)</strong></p>
<p>Born in 1935, legendary folksinger Bruce "Utah" Phillips is more than a musician, he is also a gifted storyteller, poet, humorist, and labor organizer. A mentor to Kate Wolf, Phillips has recorded songs and stories with Rosalie Sorrels and also collaborated with Ani DiFranco, for two CDs-<em>The Past Didn't Go Anywhere</em> and <em>Fellow Workers,</em> which was nominated for a Grammy award.</p>
<p><strong>July 19th -- Molly's Revenge (Irish/Celtic)</strong></p>
<p>The members of Molly's Revenge exhibit a genuine affection for the music they play, born out of the timeless tradition of Celtic music sessions. The band combines instruments such as the Highland bagpipes, uilleann pipes, whistles, fiddle, and mandolin against a backdrop of guitar and bouzouki accompaniment--throwing in the occasional rousing chorus song, as well as some Irish step dancing.</p>
<p><strong>August 16th -- Son de Madera (Son Jarocho: Traditional Music of Mexico)</strong></p>
<p>Son Jarocho is vibrant folk music and dance from Veracruz, on Mexico's eastern coast. The son, with its bright melodies, witty lyrics, and vigorous heel dancing (zapateado), is experiencing a resurgence in modern Mexico and beyond. Son Jarocho traces its roots to African, Spanish, and indigenous cultural influences. At its heart is the rhythmic framework of the jarana, a small guitar-shaped, fretted stringed instrument.</p>
<p><strong>September 20th -- Alvin Youngblood Hart (Solo/Acoustic Blues)</strong></p>
<p>His praises have been sung by everyone from Ben Harper to Brit guitar gods Eric Clapton and Mick Taylor. Since his 1996 debut recording--the all-acoustic <em>Big Mama's Door</em>--Alvin Youngblood Hart has carried his musical message the world over. He was honored with the 1997 W. C. Handy Award for Best New Artist, as well as two Living Blues Awards. Hart's 1998 release, <em>Territory,</em> also received the <em>Downbeat</em> magazine Critics Poll Award for "Best Blues Album."</p>
<p><strong>October 18th -- Jake Shimabukuro (Solo/Acoustic)</strong></p>
<p>Regarded as one of the world's top ukulele musicians, Jake Shimabukuro is known for his lightning-fast fingers and revolutionary playing techniques. Performing jazz, blues, funk, classical, bluegrass, folk, flamenco, and rock, Shimabukuro clearly demonstrates that the ukulele is capable of so much more than only traditional Hawaiian music. Experimenting with various guitar-effect pedals allows him to create sounds never thought possible on the tiny four-string instrument.</p>

<p>As a member, you'll enjoy fresh organic fruits and vegetables grown at the UCSC Farm, as well as flowers and herbs you can pick yourself.</p>
<p>Each week, shareholders pick up a diverse selection of just-harvested fruits and vegetables at the CSA Barn on the Farm. About 40 shares are still available this season, which begins in June and runs through October.</p>
<p>Full shares, which feed four to six people, cost $600, or about $27/week; half shares feed two or three people and are available for $380, or about $17/week. Payment can be made in full or in two or four installments. Low-income shares are available at half the cost.</p>
<p>CSA projects are collaborations between local communities and farmers. Members make upfront payments and in return receive a share of the weekly harvest. CSAs increase community involvement in food production and in the health of the local economy and environment.</p>
<p>The campus CSA is a program of the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), which is located on the UCSC Farm. Begun in 1994, the CSA program is an integral part of the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, which trains 40 people each year in sustainable agriculture and organic growing methods.</p>
<p>Members also receive weekly CSA newsletters with recipes, farm updates and events; complimentary membership in the Friends of the Farm &amp; Garden for one year; a 10 percent discount on plants at the Farm's annual spring and fall plant sales; quarterly issues of <em>News &amp; Notes</em>, and biannual issues of <em>The Cultivar</em>.</p>

Post, one of the nation's leading authorities on the concept of academic freedom, is scheduled to speak May 14 at the 2007 Academic Senate Committee on Academic Freedom  Lecture.</p><p>The lecture, "The Origins and Politics of Academic Freedom," is free and open to the public. It begins at 7 p.m. at the UCSC Music Center Recital Hall. </p><p>Post, the David Boies Professor of Law at Yale Law School, will address what academic freedom means in a post 9/11 United States. Post writes that academic freedom, once regarded as faintly subversive, has come to be regarded as "right" on campuses. It is not a First Amendment right, Post argues, calling it instead a professional privilege and responsibility. He poses the question: "Is that principle in jeopardy?"  </p><p>In "The Structure of Academic Freedom" published in <i>Academic Freedom after September 11,</i> Post writes, "we have grown soft and complacent. We have come all too easily to assume academic freedom as our 'God-given right' and have become oblivious to its distinct justifications and limitations."</p><p>Post is a scholar on First Amendment law. His academic focus at Yale Law School is on Constitutional law, the First Amendment, and affirmative action. Earlier he taught at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law from 1983 to 2003 where he was a key participant in the 2003 revision of the University of California's official policy on academic freedom. </p><p>Post received his B.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University and a law degree from Yale Law School. He is coeditor of <i>Civil Society and Government,</i> published in 2004.</p><p>His talk is cosponsored by the Committee on Academic Freedom; the Office of the Chancellor; Cowell, Kresge, Merrill and Stevenson Colleges; American Studies, Community Studies, Feminist Studies, History, History of Consciousness, Legal Studies, Literature, Politics, Psychology, and Sociology Departments; and the Institute for Humanities Research. </p><p>Additional information may be found from <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/caf/index.htm"> the Committee on Academic Freedom</a></p><p>and <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/faculty/RPost.htm">Robert Post's web page.</a></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9151c0068072704601a012ff1d079ba4"><name>1264</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Psychology professor Aida Hurtado receives gender equity award</title><summary>Aida Hurtado, professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has received the 2007 Distinguished Contributions to Gender Equity in Education Research Award from the American Educational Research Association (AERA).</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Hurtado, psychology, gender, equity, award, AERA, education</keywords><description>Aida Hurtado, professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has received the 2007 Distinguished Contributions to Gender Equity in Education Research Award from the American Educational Research Association (AERA).</description><start-date>1178175600000</start-date><display-name>Psychology professor Aida Hurtado...</display-name><path>/2007/05/1264</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/05/1264</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338308051</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338308051</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/05/images/hurtado_aida.180.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/05/images/hurtado_aida.180.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hurtado_aida.180.jpg</name><file-size>39787</file-size><width>180</width><height>225</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Aida Hurtado</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Aida Hurtado, professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has received the 2007 Distinguished Contributions to Gender Equity in Education Research Award from the American Educational Research Association (AERA).</p><p>The award recognizes distinguished research, professional practice, and activities that advance public understanding of gender and/or sexuality throughout the educational community. Hurtado received the award during the association's 2007 annual meeting, which took place in Chicago.</p><p>Hurtado, a social psychologist, specializes in gender equity issues and has made major contributions to national and international scholarship on issues of gender and race. </p><p>In her book <i>Relating to Privilege: Three Blasphemies on Race and Feminism</i>, Hurtado argues for a feminist paradigm that is inclusive of the concerns of all women, including women of color, and for the critical study of masculinities, as well. Her second book on feminism, <i>Voicing Chicana Feminisms: Young Women Speak Out on Sexuality and Feminism</i>, focused on young, educated Chicanas' views on gender issues in their communities. Her current book in progress, "Beyond Machismo: Young Latinos' Views on Sexuality, Gender, and Political Collaborations," is based on a study of 105 educated young Latino men.</p><p>Hurtado, who is director of the Chicano/Latino Research Center, says her scholarship begins in the classroom, where she tries out new ideas about gender equity to see if they resonate with young students. Her interdisciplinary classes are offered to students in several departments, including feminist studies, Latin American studies, and Chicano studies. </p><p>"I find that interdisciplinary exchanges are the most fruitful in deepening the study of gender equity in higher education," said Hurtado, who mentors undergraduate and graduate students, in addition to her service on dissertation committees for doctoral candidates.</p><p>"It has brought me enormous satisfaction to know I have contributed in some small way to the creation of the next generation of scholars who will take the study of gender in the academy seriously," said Hurtado.</p><p>As a member of numerous professional organizations, Hurtado has helped increase gender equity in higher education. She is an active member of Mujeres Activas en Letras y Cambio Social (MALCS, Women Active in Letters and Social Change), a multidisciplinary group focusing on Latina women scholars and activists, and just concluded a two-year term as chair of the National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies, the largest organization in the United States that focuses on ethnic studies, where she brought gender issues to the forefront of the agenda. In addition, Hurtado served during the 1990s on the University of California's Latino Eligibility Task Force, which was charged with increasing the number of Latinos and Latinas in higher education.</p><p>Founded in 1916, AERA is a 25,000-member professional organization devoted to advancing educational research and its practical application.</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9151c3188072704601a012fff5997d0f"><name>1266</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomer Garth Illingworth testifies on Capitol Hill</title><summary>Garth Illingworth, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, testified before a congressional subcommittee last week at a hearing on NASA's space science programs.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Garth Illingworth</keywords><description>Garth Illingworth, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, testified before a congressional subcommittee last week at a hearing on NASA's space science programs.</description><start-date>1178521200000</start-date><display-name>Astronomer Garth Illingworth testifies...</display-name><path>/2007/05/1266</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/05/1266</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338308830</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338308830</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/05/images/illingworth.150.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/05/images/illingworth.150.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>illingworth.150.jpg</name><file-size>36280</file-size><width>150</width><height>178</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Garth Illingworth</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Garth Illingworth, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, testified before a congressional subcommittee last week at a hearing on NASA's space science programs. He warned that NASA's highly successful science program is seriously threatened by recent and planned budgetary cutbacks. </p><p>Illingworth is chair of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Advisory Committee (AAAC), a congressionally chartered committee established to assess and make recommendations regarding the coordination of the astronomy and astrophysics programs of the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and NASA. He testified before the House Committee on Science and Technology's Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics on May 2.</p><p>"NASA science missions have played a central role in the scientific advances in the last two decades," Illingworth said. "Yet this leadership in the scientific and technological arena. . .is clearly at risk in the coming years."</p><p>He noted that NASA is significantly underfunded for the mandate that it has been given to implement the Vision for Space Exploration outlined by President George W. Bush. </p><p>"The AAAC is deeply concerned about the growing impact on the space and Earth science program and strongly endorses efforts to increase NASA's budget to allow it to undertake the transformation envisaged in the Vision without imparting serious damage to the science program," Illingworth said.</p><p>Subcommittee Chairman Mark Udall of Colorado concluded, "If we are going to ask our nation's space science program to undertake challenging and meaningful initiatives, we are going to need to provide the necessary resources."</p><p>In addition to Illingworth, witnesses testifying before the subcommittee included Alan Stern, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate; Daniel Baker, director of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado; Lennard Fisk, chair of the National Research Council's Space Studies Board; and Joseph Burns, vice provost for physical sciences and engineering at Cornell University. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9151c4b38072704601a012ff8b93ff17"><name>1267</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC astronomer Douglas Lin appointed director of Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics in China</title><summary>Douglas Lin, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, has been named founding director of the Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics (KIAA) at Peking University in Beijing, China.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Douglas Lin, Kavli Institute, China</keywords><description>Douglas Lin, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, has been named founding director of the Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics (KIAA) at Peking University in Beijing, China.</description><start-date>1178521200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC astronomer Douglas Lin...</display-name><path>/2007/05/1267</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/05/1267</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338309232</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338309232</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/05/images/lin.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/05/images/lin.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lin.250.jpg</name><file-size>58087</file-size><width>250</width><height>188</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Douglas Lin on the campus of Peking University.

Lin will keep his faculty position at UCSC while he helps launch the new institute, one of two scientific institutes established in China last year with funding from the Kavli Foundation. </p><p>"The aim is to build an institute that will be an international center of excellence to drive fundamental research in astronomy and astrophysics in that area of the world," Lin said. "It will be open to researchers of different nationalities, and the working language of the institute will be English, so it will provide a forum for visiting faculty to carry out collaborative research in China."</p><p>The KIAA research program will focus on three major areas of astrophysics--particle cosmology, star and planet formation, and gravitational physics and high-energy phenomena. It will function as an autonomous institute jointly supported by the Kavli Foundation and Peking University. (One of China's oldest universities, Peking University has retained the traditional English spelling of its name.) The university will support faculty, researchers, and students at the institute and provide a new building to house it on the Peking University campus. </p><p>"This is a great opportunity at a time when China is undergoing historic transitions," Lin said. "The economy is growing very fast, and the current government is interested in promoting basic research in areas such as astronomy. They are also going through educational reforms, and the president of Peking University, Xu Zhihong, wants to make it a top-ranked international institution of higher learning."</p><p>Lin's plans for KIAA include establishing exchange programs with UCSC and other UC campuses, as well as other institutions around the world. </p><p>"We can think about bringing exchange students back and forth, as well as postdoctoral fellows and visiting faculty. I see it as a winning proposition, and in the long run there may be opportunities for collaborative projects on a much larger scale," he said.</p><p>The Kavli Foundation has established more than a dozen institutes at leading universities, mostly in the United States, but also in Holland, England, and now China. They promote fundamental research in the fields of nanoscience, neuroscience, and theoretical physics and astrophysics. In addition to KIAA, a Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics was established at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p><p>Lin said he feels equally at home on all shores of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Born in New York, he grew up in Beijing, moved to Canada for high school, attended McGill University in Montreal, and earned his Ph.D. at Cambridge University in England. After postdoctoral positions at Cambridge and Harvard University, he joined the UCSC faculty in 1979.</p><p>"I appreciate the cultural backgrounds of China, Canada, the U.S., and Britain, having lived at least a decade in each of those places," he said.</p><p>After shuttling back and forth between California and China for the past ten months, Lin said that launching the new institute is both exciting and challenging. During the first two formative years, he expects to use sabbatical leave to spend half his time in Beijing. After that, he said he expects to spend about three months of each year at the institute.</p><p>"My sense is that in the decades to come, China will make major contributions in many different fronts.

The award was among a round of grants totaling $267,000 that the foundation has distributed to advance the goal of transparency and openness in Congress. </p><p>"The groups we are helping to fund are on the cutting edge of web 2.0 technology and are among the best at using the Internet to strengthen democracy," noted Ellen Miller, Sunlight's cofounder and executive director. </p><p>Metavid was created by Michael Dale and Abram Stern last year as their thesis project in UC Santa Cruz's new Digital Arts and New Media (DANM) graduate program. Using public domain video feed from C-SPAN, Metavid makes video archives of congressional floor proceedings on the web, searchable according to who said what, and indexed, so that users can easily link to any moment of dialogue. </p><p>"We anticipate that Metavid will be a vital media resource for journalists and citizens as they reflect on the records of candidates for the 2008 elections," said UC Santa Cruz associate professor of film and digital media Warren Sack, who wrote the grant application with his two former graduate students. "The Metavid web site will make it possible for anyone to publicly comment on the words and images of our senators and representatives as well as reuse this video footage in their own media productions."</p><p>The students built their own computers for the project to meet the tremendous storage needs of the archive--which requires space to record up to 16 hours of video a day, five days a week. They use free software and the Linux open-source operating system to make the project universally adaptable. </p><p>"Metavid won't just be a one-way conversation with "read-only" access to the politicians' rhetoric," said Dale, who will now work on the project full-time with Stern over the next year. "By embracing cutting-edge web technologies, it is instead a platform for people to use the footage and data in a digital dialogue about presidential candidates." </p><p>"This could include posting clips to their blog, and adding their own commentary and links to other videos or documents." Dale added. "Or they could combine voting history, campaign contributions, spoken transcripts, and video feeds into a critical or supportive mashup of a candidate's positions on a particular issue."</p><p>The archive is a prime example of what can be accomplished in the emerging field of public media. Like Wikipedia, the popular communal online encyclopedia, Metavid has been designed as a nonpartisan open-source web site that applies innovative technology and art for the public good. </p><p>"It's about opening up access to the public," said Dale. "It shouldn't take a multimillion-dollar corporation to do that anymore."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9151c7898072704601a012ff5b7653a3"><name>1269</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>David Draper named Fellow of the American Statistical Association</title><summary>The American Statistical Association (ASA) has selected David Draper, professor and chair of applied mathematics and statistics, as a 2007 Fellow of the ASA.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>David Draper</keywords><description>The American Statistical Association (ASA) has selected David Draper, professor and chair of applied mathematics and statistics, as a 2007 Fellow of the ASA.</description><start-date>1178521200000</start-date><display-name>David Draper named Fellow...</display-name><path>/2007/05/1269</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/05/1269</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338309978</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338309978</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/05/images/draper.150.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/05/images/draper.150.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>draper.150.jpg</name><file-size>45709</file-size><width>150</width><height>184</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>David Draper.

</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The State Historical Resources Commission on May 3 granted approval for listing UCSC's  Cowell Lime Works Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places.</p><p>The historic district, which was nominated by UCSC, is an area of about 30 acres around the main entrance of the campus on either side of Coolidge Drive. The district includes historic buildings and lime production features and related support facilities that date to the latter half of the 19th and early 20th centuries. </p><p>The UCSC campus was established on lands that once were part of the Cowell Ranch. Henry Cowell, a major industrialist in central California, operated a large complex of industrial lime production and support facilities scattered throughout what are now campus lands. His local holdings also extended widely into surrounding areas. Lime, which was produced at the campus site by burning limestone in large redwood-fired kilns, was critical in the manufacture of cement and also was used in a number of other industries.</p><p>The complex of historic buildings and features that have been included in the campus's historic district are of particular historic value because they represent the full range of facilities needed in a historic rural industrial operation, including both lime-processing facilities and also ranch and worker-support buildings. </p><p>Prominent on Coolidge Drive are the Cooperage and the lime kilns and several small quarries, which can be seen along Coolidge Drive. Limestone from these and other larger quarries was burned in the kilns, and the product was packaged in barrels manufactured at the Cooperage (the long structure on stone pillars). The remnants of the tramway trestle and rail bed used to carry limestone and redwood from the upper campus can also be seen along Coolidge Drive. Also included in the district are several of the barns and the Blacksmith's Shop used in the care of the draft animals used on the limeworks and ranch. </p><p>A historic horse barn, now the Barn Theater, is at the northwest corner of High Street and Coolidge Drive. In addition, the district includes the Cookhouse (now the campus Admissions Office), where ranch workers were fed, as well as ruins and archaeological remains of several workers' cabins. Finally, the district includes the ranch owner's house, know as Cardiff House, now the Women's Center, and the entry gate and drive to the house, which can been seen on High Street just east of the campus entrance.</p><p>Henry Cowell dominated the masonry supply business in northern California during the late 1800s. When he died in 1903 he owned property in 23 California counties. Besides lime-manufacturing plants, dairies, and cattle ranches, he was involved in banking, real estate, shipping, warehousing, and had financial interests in a railroad and hotel. Due to the family's philanthropy, the Cowell name is on a college at UCSC, several university health centers, and several parks. The S. H. Cowell Foundation continues to be one of northern California's major foundations, supporting social causes. Henry Cowell and his legacy have had and continue to have an important impact in northern California.</p><p>The campus has drafted a management plan for the district, which is under internal review.  This includes measures to enhance the historic appearance of the district, as well as recommendations for future treatment of surviving buildings. Preservation recommendations have been taken into account in the recent seismic retrofit of the Cookhouse, and recent repairs at the Granary (now a campus childcare center). Barn H, in the campus corporation yard, was recently stained white, for consistency with the historic appearance of these farm buildings. The campus has also conducted historic archaeological excavations in conjunction with work within the district, and is preparing public interpretive signage to inform the public about the history of the site. </p><p>A campus grant application for seismic retrofit of the historic Paymaster's House (a small stone building near the campus entrance) and interior remodeling for use as a curatorial and archaeological research facility is under consideration by the California State Historical Endowment.</p><p><b>Related links:</b></p><p><a href="http://santacruzmah.org/shop/books-hist-limekiln.html">Lime Kiln Legacies</a>, an anthology of articles published by the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History.</p><p><a href="http://www.santacruzpl.org/history/work/edindlum.shtml">Local history: Economic Development of the City of Santa Cruz 1850-1950</a></p><p><a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/06-07/08-14/history.asp">Construction projects uncovering pieces of the past</a></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9151cd098072704601a012ffe80b3199"><name>1273</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz professor honored in 11th annual Webby Awards</title><author>Scott Rappaport (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1178607600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz professor...</display-name><path>/2007/05/1273</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/05/1273</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338311383</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338311383</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/05/images/daniel.sharon_2006_029.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/05/images/daniel.sharon_2006_029.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>daniel.sharon_2006_029.jpg</name><file-size>37868</file-size><width>200</width><height>263</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz professor of film and digital media Sharon Daniel (photo by Jim MacKenzie)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>Public Secrets</em>, an online art project created by UC Santa Cruz film and digital media associate professor Sharon Daniel, has been named an Official Honoree in the Activism category at this year's Webby Awards.</p>
<p>Hailed as the "Oscars of the Internet" by the <em>New York Times,</em> the Webby Awards are the leading international award honoring excellence on the Internet. The awards are judged by the International Academy of Digital Arts &amp; Sciences, a 550-person global organization whose members include David Bowie, Harvey Weinstein, Arianna Huffington, Matt Groening, Jamie Oliver, Internet inventor Vinton Cerf, and RealNetworks CEO Rob Glaser.</p>
<p>"The Webby Awards honors the outstanding work that is setting the standards for the Internet," said David-Michael Davies, executive director of the Webby Awards. "Official Honoree selection is a testament to the skill, ingenuity, and vision of its creators."</p>
<p>The 11th Annual Webby Awards received a record 8,000 entries from over 60 countries and all 50 states. Out of more than 8,000 entries submitted, fewer than 15 percent were deemed Official Honorees.</p>
<p>Daniel's research involves collaborations with communities that focus on the use and development of information and communications technologies for social inclusion. Her <em>Public Secrets</em> project is an interactive web site of testimonials in which women incarcerated in the California State Prison System reveal the secret injustices of the war on drugs, the criminal justice system, and the prison industrial complex. The project is a collaboration with the nonprofit human rights organization <a href="http://jnow.org">Justice Now</a> and was completed with the support of a fellowship from the <a href="http://vectorsjournal.org"><em>Vectors Journal of Culture and Technology in a Dynamic Vernacular</em></a>, the online journal where it was published.</p>
<p>Daniel's work has been exhibited internationally at numerous museums and festivals, including the Corcoran Biennial 2001, University of Paris I, Dutch Electronic Arts Festival, Ars Electronica, and Lincoln Center Festival, as well as on the Internet.

Berman is the first faculty member to hold the endowed chair, established in 2003 with a gift of $500,000 from philanthropist Jack Baskin, a UCSC Foundation trustee and longtime supporter of the Baskin School of Engineering.</p><p>"The endowment from Jack Baskin provides a valuable source of support for the Department of Biomolecular Engineering, and I am honored to hold this endowed chair," Berman said.</p><p>The engineering school established the Department of Biomolecular Engineering in 2004, and Berman was recruited to lead the new department in 2006. A pioneer in the development of recombinant vaccines for AIDS and other infectious diseases, Berman has nearly 25 years of experience in the biotechnology industry. His current interests include the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, as well as the development of new technology for commercial production of complex recombinant glycoproteins. </p><p>Berman outlined several areas in which he plans to use the funding from the endowed chair. These include support for educational enrichment activities, such as outside speakers for lectures and seminars; the purchase of shared equipment for biological research laboratories; and support for student activities, such as travel to local professional meetings. </p><p>The Biomolecular Engineering Department features an interdisciplinary blend of engineering, biology, chemistry, and statistics designed to foster collaboration with other departments. Members of the department are engaged in active collaborations with faculty in other departments within the engineering school and in the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences. </p><p>The department offers degree programs in bioinformatics and biomolecular engineering. Berman said he is working to develop a strong curriculum to give students the best possible training for jobs in the biotechnology industry. He also noted that the convergence of different areas of research, from nanotechnology to genomics, in biomedical applications makes biomolecular engineering an especially exciting field. </p><p>Berman earned his bachelor's degree in biology at UC Berkeley and his Ph.D. in biochemistry at Dartmouth Medical School. He spent 15 years at Genentech, where he led research on recombinant proteins, vaccine development, and monoclonal antibodies. In 1995, he cofounded VaxGen, where he served as senior vice president for research and development and oversaw efforts to develop an HIV vaccine. In 2004, Berman cofounded Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases, a nonprofit research organization dedicated to addressing infectious disease problems in the developing world. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9151cfca8072704601a012ff2642bf58"><name>1275</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Employees required to complete 'ethics briefing' by June 15</title><start-date>1178607600000</start-date><display-name>Employees required to complete...</display-name><path>/2007/05/1275</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/05/1275</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338312092</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338312092</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>During the week of May 7, many UCSC Academic &amp; Staff employees were scheduled to receive an email from <a href="mailto:ethics@ucsc.edu">ethics@ucsc.edu</a> reminding them to complete a 30 minute on-line Ethics Briefing.</p>

The academy announced the election of 72 new members on May 1, bringing the total number of active members to 2,025. </p><p>Edgar is known for significant contributions in two areas of molecular biology--the genetics and self-assembly of viruses and the genetics of a tiny worm, the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans,</i> which Edgar helped establish as one of the most useful model organisms for biological research. </p><p>As a professor of biology at the California Institute of Technology, Edgar did pioneering research in molecular biology, studying a virus that infects bacteria (known as bacteriophage T4). He received the Molecular Biology Award from the National Academy of Sciences for this work in 1965. </p><p>In 1970, Edgar came to UC Santa Cruz as founding provost of Kresge College. His primary focus initially was on undergraduate education and the establishment of the new college. But he also continued his research, and he became interested in <i>C. elegans</i> as a model system for studying developmental biology. In 1975, he began publishing <i>The Worm Breeder's Gazette,</i> in which <i>C. elegans</i> researchers shared their ideas and discoveries. The publication played a major role in the development of the community of researchers studying this important organism.</p><p>Edgar also had a role in the beginnings of the Human Genome Project as a key participant in the 1985 workshop organized by Robert Sinsheimer, then chancellor of UCSC, to explore the feasibility of sequencing the human genome. The Santa Cruz workshop planted the seed for what later became the International Human Genome Project. </p><p>A fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Edgar earned his bachelor's degree at McGill University in Montreal and Ph.D. in biology at the University of Rochester. </p><p>Established in 1863, the National Academy of Sciences is an honorific society of distinguished scholars engaged in scientific and engineering research, dedicated to the furtherance of science and technology and to their use for the general welfare. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9151d3df8072704601a012ff1fed5774"><name>1278</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Exhibit by UCSC art students at Museum of Art and History</title><author>Scott Rappaport (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1179126000000</start-date><display-name>Exhibit by UCSC art...</display-name><path>/2007/05/1278</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/05/1278</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338313124</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338313124</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Art</value><value>History of Art and Visual Culture</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/05/images/museum.art.200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/05/images/museum.art.200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>museum.art.200.jpg</name><file-size>40117</file-size><width>200</width><height>150</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>An exhibition by UCSC art students titled "Invisible Boardwalks" runs through June 1 at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History. </image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History is presenting an exhibition by UCSC art students titled "Invisible Boardwalks" through June 1 at its Lezin Gallery.

He received his Ph.D. in philosophy from Harvard University in 2000 and spent a year as a postdoctoral fellow in Israel, as well as four years as a Harper Fellow at the University of Chicago. He also majored in astronomy and astrophysics as an undergraduate at Harvard and did graduate work in astrophysics at Princeton. Stone's research interests include the philosophy of science and mathematics, ancient and medieval philosophy, and early 20th-century German philosophy. </p><p>Stone said he plans to use the fellowship to complete a book about the current division of the modern philosophical world into two schools of thought: Analytic and Continental philosophy. "The project of this book concerns what I take to be the origin of this split, in Germany in the1920s, exemplified by and in large part due to the divergence between the thought of Martin Heidegger and of Rudolf Carnap," said Stone. "I claim, somewhat controversially, that the most important early influence on both of them is Edmund Husserl (the German philosopher known as the father of phenomenology)."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9151d78f8072704601a012ff6767985d"><name>1281</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Anti-war protest planned for Wednesday, May 9; main campus entrance may be affected</title><start-date>1178694000000</start-date><display-name>Anti-war protest planned for...</display-name><path>/2007/05/1281</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/05/1281</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338314046</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338314046</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Student leaders of a new group, Protest Mediation Council, have informed the campus that they have organized an anti-war rally that will begin in Quarry Plaza at approximately noon today (May 9).

A reception hosted by the Lionel Cantú GLBTI Resource Center will follow immediately.</p><p>This year's featured guest is Angel David Nieves, assistant professor in the historic preservation program of the School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation at the University of Maryland at College Park. His work examines "race-uplift" efforts of late 19th-century African American women reformers who used the built environment to effect social and political change for their communities. Nieves is also the coeditor with Leslie Alexander of the forthcoming volume, "'We Shall Independent Be': African American Place-Making and the Struggle to Claim Space in the U.S."</p><p>The colloquium honors the memory of Cantú, an assistant professor of sociology who died unexpectedly in 2002. At UCSC, the Lionel Cantú Memorial Award Fund was established to support a campus graduate student who is pursuing studies in one or more of the areas in which Cantú worked: immigration studies, transnational/cross-border studies, Latino/Latina sociology, gender and sexuality, or gay men and masculinity. This year's recipient of the $500 award will be announced at the colloquium. The 2007 selection committee comprises UCSC faculty members from sociology, Latin American and Latino studies, and the Chicano/a Latino/a Research Center.</p><p>Colloquium cosponsors include the Chicano/Latino Research Center, El Centro: Chicano/Latino Resource Center, the Feminist Studies Department, Frank Talamantes (professor emeritus and former dean of graduate studies), the Latin American and Latino Studies Department, the Lionel Cantú GLBTI Resource Center, Queer Theory Cluster, Research Cluster for the Study of Women of Color in Collaboration and Conflict, the Sociology Department, and the Sociology Graduate Students of Color Caucus.

Recent media attention toward regional traffic congestion, rising fossil fuel costs, and the impacts of climate change coincide with a growing awareness of how each of us can effect a positive change in the health of our society and the planet.</p><p>Every May, the statewide Clean Air Month campaign promotes practices that help improve air quality. More than half of the UCSC community already rely on sustainable transportation to travel to and from campus each day. Since 41 percent of California's greenhouse gas emissions originate from transportation sources, our travel choices have a substantial impact on the course of global warming.</p><p>I encourage you to make the commitment to carpool, bicycle, walk to work, ride the bus, vanpool, or telecommute at least four times during Clean Air Month. Santa Cruz, Monterey, and San Benito County residents who do so--including those who already use commute options regularly--can participate in a chance to win $1,000.  Visit <a href="http://www.cleanairmonth.net">www.cleanairmonth.net</a> to register.</p><p>Some great activities, including Bike Week, take place during Clean Air Month. UCSC is a proud sponsor of the 20th Annual Spring Bike to Work/School Day on Thursday, May 17, and will host three Free Breakfast sites on campus and one at the Seymour Center. For complete information on the Bike Week activities visit: <a href="http://www.bike2work.com">www.bike2work.com</a>.</p><p>Thank you to all the staff, faculty, and students who already use sustainable transportation--and to those of you making a change this month. Your travel choices help make UCSC and Santa Cruz a more livable, vibrant community while demonstrating the positive effect we each can have on our local and global environment.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Acting Chancellor Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9151e4078072704601a012ff17b8d716"><name>1290</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus Elections</title><start-date>1179126000000</start-date><display-name>Campus Elections...</display-name><path>/2007/05/1290</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/05/1290</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338317263</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338317263</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I write to announce that Campus Elections will begin on Tuesday, May 15, and will continue through Tuesday, May 22.

Blooms of the algae, which produce a neurotoxin called domoic acid, first appeared in southern California earlier this spring and are now occurring along the Central Coast.</p>
<p>Researchers throughout the Monterey Bay region have been monitoring the situation closely and have detected high levels of the toxin in the bay. Meanwhile, large numbers of dead seabirds, as well as sea lions with symptoms of domoic acid poisoning, have been turning up on Monterey Bay beaches. The link between seabird deaths and domoic acid poisoning is difficult to make, however, and researchers are still analyzing data and waiting for definitive test results.</p>
<p>"The impact on marine life depends on how much of the toxin gets into the food web, but in terms of toxin production and the size of the bloom this event is similar to the large blooms we saw in Monterey Bay in 2000 and 2002," said Raphael Kudela, associate professor of ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>At the same time, harmless blooms of "red tide" algae have turned the water a reddish-brown color in parts of Monterey Bay. These organisms, a type of dinoflagellate in the genus <i>Ceratium,</i> do not produce toxins.</p>
<p>Domoic acid is produced by diatoms (a type of single-celled algae) in the genus <i>Pseudo-nitzschia.</i> A potent neurotoxin, domoic acid accumulates in shellfish and fish that feed on the algae, such as anchovies and sardines.</p>
<p>In humans, consumption of seafood contaminated with the toxin causes amnesic shellfish poisoning. Consumers are protected by quarantines on sport-harvested shellfish and state monitoring programs that keep contaminated seafood off the market. But seabirds and marine mammals can suffer massive die-offs during this kind of harmful algal bloom.</p>
<p>In southern California, hundreds of seabirds and marine mammals have died from domoic acid poisoning this spring. The domoic acid levels there have been much higher than those detected so far in Monterey Bay--a mussel from Santa Barbara had the highest domoic acid level ever detected. Large numbers of marine animals have been affected, including dolphins and other cetaceans.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinated efforts</strong></p>
<p>Several collaborative projects funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are helping to coordinate the efforts of researchers who are tracking the situation along the Central Coast. The Center for Integrated Marine Technologies (<a href="http://cimt.ucsc.edu">CIMT</a>), led by UC Santa Cruz researchers, has been conducting regular surveys of marine life and oceanographic conditions in Monterey Bay for the past five years. UCSC researchers are also working with the California Department of Health Services on a NOAA-funded statewide monitoring program called the California Program for Regional Enhanced Monitoring for PhycoToxins (<a href="http://calpreempt.ucsc.edu">CalPReEMPT</a>).</p>
<p>CIMT and CalPReEMPT researchers intensified their monitoring efforts this spring in response to the developing harmful algal bloom, using a combination of satellite imaging, analysis of water samples and tissue samples from mussels, and surveys of marine life throughout the bay and on the beaches.</p>
<p>CalPReEMPT researchers reported large numbers of <i>Pseudo-nitzschia</i> cells and high toxin levels at the Santa Cruz wharf on May 2, but reduced levels a week later. Results from a bay-wide CIMT survey on May 8 and 9 showed the highest domoic acid levels in the middle of Monterey Bay, with high values to the north and no detectable toxin in the south bay.</p>
<p>"It's not a single, uniform event--the blooms are spotty, both in time and in locations throughout the bay," said Mary Silver, professor of ocean sciences at UCSC. "When you look at satellite images, the blooms are almost like weather systems or cloud formations--they come and go on a day-to-day basis. But the animals are being affected."</p>
<p><strong>Sea lions</strong></p>
<p>James Harvey, a CIMT collaborator at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML), said California sea lions are the marine mammal species most affected by domoic acid, because they are plentiful along the coast and feed heavily on anchovies and other fish that accumulate the toxin. He said the current harmful algal blooms may end up killing hundreds of California sea lions, but the increased mortality will not have a significant impact on their population, which is currently around 160,000 to 180,000.</p>
<p>"It's hard to assess the numbers, because all we see are the ones that wash up on the beach. For southern California, the numbers on the beach are definitely elevated this year," Harvey said. "The numbers locally are not that unusual, but we have seen sea lions with symptoms of domoic acid poisoning."</p>
<p>The Marine Mammal Center in Marin County has been seeing sea lions from the Monterey Bay area with acute domoic acid poisoning since the end of March, including five admitted since the beginning of May, said staff veterinarian Felicia Nutter. Several animals have also had seizures and died on the beach before they could be transported to the center, she said.</p>
<p>Melissa Miller, a veterinary pathologist at the California Department of Fish and Game's Marine Wildlife Veterinary Care and Research Center, reported that dead sea otters found in the Santa Cruz area this spring showed signs supportive of domoic acid poisoning.</p>
<p>Two dead whales also washed up on area beaches this spring, but their deaths were probably unrelated to domoic acid, said Donald Croll, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC.</p>
<p>"This is the time of year when the females and calves are moving north to their feeding grounds, and there is typically some mortality along the way," he said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Seabirds</strong></p>
<p>CIMT coordinates with the monitoring programs of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, such as Beach COMBERS, a sanctuary and MLML volunteer program that conducts regular surveys for marine birds and mammals on the beaches. Although the numbers of dead birds on the beaches are higher than normal this spring, it is not yet clear whether domoic acid poisoning is responsible. The Beach COMBERS reported a large die-off of common murres in Monterey Bay in February and March that appeared to be the result of poor prey availability.</p>
<p>According to Croll, CIMT surveys show that the recent increase in birds found on the beaches is not due to an unusually large number of birds in the bay. But determining the cause of the bird deaths is not easy. Necropsies (postmortem exams) of dead seabirds have so far not shown typical signs of domoic acid poisoning, according to Elizabeth Phillips of the Department of Fish and Game's Marine Wildlife Veterinary Care and Research Center. Tissue samples are being tested for domoic acid, but researchers are still waiting for those results. Some of the dead birds have appeared emaciated and may have starved to death, Phillips said.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of factors at play in the seabird mortalities we've seen lately, and it is difficult to determine whether the increased mortality is related to a domoic acid event or a combination of mortality factors," she said.</p>
<p>CIMT surveys indicate that krill, the small crustaceans that are a favorite food for many seabirds, are currently abundant in Monterey Bay, Croll said. But the krill may be contaminated with domoic acid.</p>
<p>Upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water along the coast, driven by winds that push the warm surface layer offshore, determines the productivity of the Monterey Bay ecosystem. The influx of nutrients sparks blooms of algae, which feed krill and small fish that are, in turn, prey for larger fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. Why the algal blooms are dominated by toxin-producing algae in some years is one of the questions researchers are trying to answer. This is a natural phenomenon, however, and will subside as conditions change in the bay.</p>

This region is warmer than the rest of the frozen surface of Enceladus and has features called "tiger stripes" that look like tectonic fault lines.</p><p>"We think the tiger stripes are the source of the plumes, and we made predictions of where the tiger stripes should be hottest that can be tested by future measurements," Nimmo said. </p><p>Driving the whole process is the moon's eccentric orbit, which brings it close to Saturn and then farther away, so that the gravitational attraction it feels changes over time. </p><p>"It's getting squeezed and stretched as it goes around Saturn, and those tidal forces cause the faults to move back and forth," Nimmo said. </p><p>Unlike some other proposals for the origin of the plumes, this mechanism does not require the presence of liquid water near the surface of Enceladus, noted coauthor Robert Pappalardo of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.</p><p>"The heat is sufficient to cause ice to sublimate, like in a comet--the ice evaporates into vapor, and the escaping vapor drags particles off into space," Pappalardo said.</p><p>The study does suggest, however, that Enceladus has a liquid ocean lying deep beneath the ice. That allows the ice shell to deform enough to produce the necessary movement in the faults. If the ice shell sat directly on top of the moon's rocky interior, tidal forces would not produce enough movement in the faults to generate heat, Nimmo said. </p><p>The frictional or "shear heating" mechanism is consistent with an earlier study by Nimmo and Pappalardo, in which they proposed that Enceladus reoriented itself to position the hot spot at the south pole (see earlier <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=878">press release</a>). In that study, the researchers described how the reorientation of Enceladus would result from a lower density of the thick ice shell in this region.</p><p>In the new paper, the researchers estimated the thickness of the ice shell to be at least 5 kilometers (3 miles) and probably several tens of kilometers or miles. They also estimated that the movement along the fault lines is about half a meter over the course of a tidal period. </p><p>In addition to Nimmo and Pappalardo, the coauthors of the paper include John Spencer of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, and McCall Mullen of the University of Colorado, Boulder. This study was funded by NASA's Planetary Geology and Geophysics and Outer Planets research programs.</p><p>Enceladus has sparked great interest among scientists, particularly since the discovery more than a year ago by NASA's Cassini spacecraft of the geysers shooting off its surface. This is one of two papers about Enceladus appearing in the May 17 issue of <i>Nature.</i> In the other paper, scientists explain how cracks in the icy surface of Enceladus open and close under Saturn's pull. Saturn's tides could control the timing of the geysers' eruptions, researchers suggest.</p><p>The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Italian Space Agency.

M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to reveal the precise locations and environments of a pair of supermassive black holes at the center of an ongoing collision between two galaxies 300 million light-years away. </p><p>The new observations of the galaxy merger known as NGC 6240 reveal that each of the black holes resides at the center of a rotating disk of stars and is surrounded by a cloud of young star clusters formed in the merger, said Claire Max, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p><p>"People had observed this pair of colliding galaxies at different wavelengths and seen what they thought were the black holes, but it's been very hard to make sense of how the observations at various wavelengths correspond to each other," Max said. "The adaptive optics results enabled us to tie it all together, so now we can really see it all--the hot dust in the infrared, the stars in the visible and infrared, and the x-rays and radio emissions coming from right around the black holes."</p><p>Adaptive optics (AO) enables astronomers to counteract the blurring effects of turbulence in Earth's atmosphere, which degrades images seen by ground-based telescopes. Max, who directs the Center for Adaptive Optics at UC Santa Cruz, is the lead author of a paper describing the new findings published by the journal <i>Science</i> (Science Express online, May 17, and in a later print edition). Her coauthors are Gabriela Canalizo, who worked with Max as a postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and is now at UC Riverside, and Willem de Vries, a physicist with LLNL and UC Davis. </p><p>Images of NGC 6240 in visible light from the Hubble Space Telescope show the outer parts of the colliding galaxies distorted by their ongoing merger into long tidal tails of stars, gas, and dust. In the bright central region, two distinct nuclei can be discerned, but clouds of dust obscure much of the visible light from the core. The presence of two supermassive black holes in NGC 6240 was first demonstrated by x-ray observations from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2002. Two pointlike radio sources were also detected in the central region.</p><p>But trying to match up the data from one instrument with those obtained at different wavelengths by other instruments is very difficult because there are few common reference points in the various wavelength regimes, Max said. The infrared images her group obtained using the AO system on the 10-meter Keck II Telescope provided the high spatial resolution needed to identify features in NGC 6240 that can be seen in different wavelengths.</p><p>"With the infrared images we got at Keck, we were able to line up the information from all the different wavelengths to determine which features in the images are the black holes," Max said.</p><p>The infrared wavelengths are less affected by dust than visible light, and the Keck infrared images show distinct nuclei with complex substructure surrounded by many faint point sources. The faint point sources are young star clusters produced in a burst of star formation triggered by the collision of the two gas-rich galaxies. Pinpointing which of the features in the infrared images correspond to the positions of the black holes involved several steps and required Keck adaptive optics observations at different infrared wavelengths. </p><p>"We uncovered it piece by piece, until we were able to make the correspondence between the black holes and the features seen at different wavelengths, as well as the stuff around them," Max said. "It really shows how powerful the Keck adaptive optics system is. We were also fortunate to have an extraordinarily good observing night."</p><p>Galaxy mergers are thought to play a major role in the evolution of galaxies and may help explain many of their properties. For example, astronomers have found that the mass of the black hole at the center of a galaxy is highly correlated with large-scale properties of the galaxy itself. The "coevolution" hypothesis explains this correlation as the result of both the black hole and the galaxy around it growing incrementally in repeated merger events over cosmic timescales. </p><p>"The gravitational influence of the black hole is actually limited to a relatively small region right around it, so how can it affect the rest of the galaxy? But if the black hole and the galaxy around it evolved together through the same sequence of merger events, that would explain the correlations," Max said.

<p>The historic district, which was nominated by UCSC for listing, is an area of about 30 acres around the main entrance of the campus on either side of Coolidge Drive. It includes historic buildings, lime production features and related support facilities that date to the latter half of the 19th and early 20th centuries, when industrialist Henry Cowell operated the complex and support facilities on what is now campus land.</p>
<p>"We're working with local historian Frank Perry, who helped us on the National Register nomination, to come up with ways to interpret the site to the public," said UCSC senior environmental planner and archaeologist Sally Morgan.</p>
<p>Morgan said the campus would like to construct guideposts to help people follow the self-guided walking tour Perry described in his book Lime Kiln Legacies, being published by the Museum of Art and History in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Henry Cowell, a major industrialist in central California, operated a large complex of industrial lime production and support facilities scattered throughout what is now campus land.</p>
<p>Interest in campus historic preservation has intensified since the awarding of a $100,000 Getty heritage grant in 2004. (<a added="" addition="" and="" appearance.="" are="" but="" consistent="" cook="" for="" historic="" house="" href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/08-09/getty_award.html%3Ehttp://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/08-09/getty_award.html%3C/a%3E)%20%3C/p%3E%3Cp%3ERecent%20seismic%20retrofitting%20and%20repairs%20at%20the%20Cook%20House%20and%20Granary,%20now%20a%20campus%20child%20care%20center,%20have%20been%20done%20with%20an%20eye%20toward%20preservation." in="" lighting="" lights="" meet="" more="" morgan.="" mortar="" of="" or="" our="" part="" replaced="" restored="" said="" standards="" stone="" that="" the="" their="" to="" were="" windows="" with=""></a></p>
<p>One idea for future work, Morgan said, is to stain many of the historic buildings on campus white for consistency with the historic appearance of the onetime farm buildings. Barn H, in the campus corporation yard, was the first to get the old-fashioned stain, to resemble the whitewash used historically.</p>
<p>An overall plan to enhance the historic appearance of the district is now being finalized.</p>
<p>The campus has also applied for a grant to transform the historic Paymaster's House, a small stone building near the campus entrance, into a curatorial and archaeological research facility. The grant, which would include seismic work, is being considered by the California Cultural and Historical Endowment.</p>
<p>Included in the historic district are the Cooperage, lime kilns, and several small quarries along Coolidge Drive. Limestone from these and other larger quarries was burned in the kilns, and the product was packaged in barrels manufactured at the Cooperage (the long structure on stone pillars). The remnants of the tramway trestle and rail bed used to carry limestone and redwood from the upper campus can also be seen along Coolidge Drive. Also included in the district are several of the barns and the Blacksmith's Shop used in the care of the draft animals used on the limeworks and ranch.</p>
<p>Also a part of the district are the historic horse barn, now the Barn Theater, the Cook House (now the campus Admissions Office), where ranch workers were fed, as well as ruins and archaeological remains of several workers' cabins. The district also extends to the ranch owner's house, known as Cardiff House--now the Women's Center--and the entry gate and drive to the house, which can been seen on High Street just east of the campus entrance.</p>
<p>According to historian Frank Perry, Henry Cowell dominated the masonry supply business in northern California during the late 1800s. When he died in 1903, he owned property in 23 California counties. Besides lime-manufacturing plants, dairies, and cattle ranches, he was involved in banking, real estate, shipping, warehousing, and had financial interests in a railroad and hotel. Due to the family's philanthropy, the Cowell name is on a college at UCSC, several university health centers, and several parks. The S. H. Cowell Foundation continues to be one of northern California's major foundations, supporting social causes. Henry Cowell and his legacy have had and continue to have an important impact in northern California.</p>

The center's mentoring program has provided much-needed support for everyone in the system, from new teachers all the way up to the superintendent. </p><p>The district has been under a court-ordered consent decree since 2000 because of deficiencies in its special education program. In 2003, the Hewlett Foundation funded a $350,000 project so NTC could provide mentoring support to novice teachers in two schools where the annual teacher turnover rate was about 75 percent. The NTC's philosophy is based on evidence that the best way to improve student performance is to  improve the quality of instruction.</p><p>That initial collaboration soon blossomed into broader support after a third school asked to join the project. Now all seven schools in the district participate in NTC mentoring and professional development programs. The collaboration was the subject of a recent lengthy article in <i>Education Week.</i> </p><p>"Ravenswood has historically been involved in a lot of controversy and conflict and lawsuits, and turmoil at the top," Superintendent Maria Meza-De La Vega told <i>Education Week.</i> "The high turnover of teachers was a huge impediment to us moving forward."</p><p>With the Hewlett funding, Ravenswood is one of a handful of districts where the NTC is working toward "systemic school change." In addition to providing coaches for new teachers, the superintendent, principals, and assistant principals, NTC supports veteran teachers with grade-level teams and bolsters after-school academic support programs. </p><p>Kitty Dixon, director of school/district support and innovation for the NTC, is the project director, serving as a link between the schools and district offices. She and Miakje Kamstra, director of mentor development for the NTC, are "on the ground" in the district, attending meetings, providing one-on-one support to teachers and administrators, and keeping an eye out for what is working and what isn't.</p><p>"Our strategy at the school and district level is to identify the needs of teachers and principals that directly relate to improving instruction and working conditions," said Dixon, underscoring that the high-level of support wouldn't be possible without the Hewlett Foundation funding. "We then align professional development and mentoring with meeting those needs. The professional development feeds their soul and is having a direct impact on student achievement." </p><p>"As we gradually increase the capacity of teachers and build leadership at every level, we will work ourselves out of a job by design," said Dixon. </p><p>During the center's work with the initial three schools, new teacher turnover dropped from 73 percent in 2003-04 to only 16 percent the following year. In 2005-06, all but 13 percent of new teachers returned in the fall. As those trends continue, Dixon and her colleagues are able to introduce other changes. </p><p>"Stabilizing the workforce is the first step in addressing the needs of teachers and their students," said Dixon. "It's the foundation on which we build the rest of the structure. Teachers have really responded to what's happening in the district. They want to be here."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9151f9e28072704601a012ff8e41ae40"><name>1305</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus invited to annual Strawberry Shortcake Festival</title><summary>The UCSC Farm will hold its annual Strawberry Shortcake Festival on Wednesday.

Among their findings is evidence of reproductive behavior in the past that is not seen in modern populations of northern fur seals. </p><p>The study will be published in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i> (online Early Edition, May 21 to 25, and in a later print edition).</p><p>"We were able to reconstruct this species' prehistoric range and see changes in biogeography and behavior over timescales longer than ecologists usually think about," said Seth Newsome, who worked on the study as a graduate student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and is now a postdoctoral researcher at the Carnegie Institution of Washington. </p><p>Today, the main breeding colony of northern fur seals is on the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea. Newsome and his collaborators confirmed that the species once had major breeding colonies at temperate latitudes in California, the Pacific Northwest, and the eastern Aleutian Islands. The abundance of their bones in archaeological sites suggests they were an important part of the marine ecosystems in those regions. The researchers also found that northern fur seals in those temperate latitude breeding colonies nursed their young for much longer than modern fur seals, which wean their pups just four months after birth.</p><p>Newsome, the lead author of the <i>PNAS</i> paper, said the study is important because fur seals and many other species were decimated by commercial harvesting long before scientists were able to study them firsthand. "In a lot of cases, what we consider natural for a species may not have been its natural state prior to human disturbance," he said.</p><p>The disappearance of northern fur seals from some temperate regions coincided with the arrival of Russian and European fur traders about 200 years ago. But in central and northern California, fur seal populations collapsed about 800 to 1,200 years ago, long before European contact, the researchers found. The cause of the earlier collapse remains unclear, but it may have been climate change, human hunting, or a combination of factors.</p><p>Newsome worked closely with Michael Etnier, an archaeologist at the University of Washington in Seattle, and with faculty in four different departments at UC Santa Cruz, all coauthors of the paper. They include Diane Gifford-Gonzalez, a professor of anthropology and curator of the Monterey Bay Archaeology Archives; Paul Koch, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences who uses isotope chemistry to study ancient fossils; Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and an expert on marine mammal physiology and ecology; and Thomas Guilderson, a lecturer in ocean sciences also affiliated with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Donald Phillips of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Marcel van Tuinen and Elizabeth Hadly of Stanford University, and Douglas Kennett of the University of Oregon also contributed to the paper.</p><p>The study grew out of work begun at UCSC in the 1990s by Gifford-Gonzalez and Koch, who teamed up to investigate the abrupt disappearance of northern fur seals from the archaeological record along California's central coast. As early as the 1970s, Gifford-Gonzalez and others had noted the abundance of northern fur seal bones in shell middens in northern and central California. She began working with Koch and graduate student Robert Burton to see if isotope analysis of the bones could help unravel the mystery.</p><p>"It's been a wonderful collaboration that branched out as the project grew, and we've made alliances across so many institutions now it's dizzying," said Gifford-Gonzalez. "The <i>PNAS</i> paper is a culmination of that work, and it shows just how much information one can get out of ancient bone samples with this kind of coordinated, multidisciplinary approach."</p><p>The relative abundance of different chemical isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in bones can indicate what and where the animals ate when they were alive. Nitrogen isotopes can also be used to characterize the duration of nursing and approximate age at weaning of mammals. Newsome performed most of the isotope analysis, while Etnier used morphometric techniques (careful measurements of the bones calibrated against modern samples) to determine the age at death of the animals the bones came from. </p><p>Combining these techniques, the researchers showed that the prehistoric northern fur seals in California were not visitors from northern waters, but were instead year-round residents. The analyses also revealed the nursing and weaning strategies of these prehistoric populations.</p><p>Of the 14 species in the family of eared seals, only the northern and Antarctic fur seals exhibit a "short-term" reproductive strategy, weaning their pups at four months so that they can leave the breeding colonies before winter arrives. </p><p>"The Bering Sea has a highly productive marine ecosystem in the summer, but it shuts down in winter and the sea around the Pribilofs freezes over. The seals have to wean their pups and move south, and they can be found off central and northern California throughout the winter," Newsome said.</p><p>All other eared seals nurse their young for 12 to 14 months, and sometimes as long as two years. This "long-term" maternal strategy appears to have been used by prehistoric northern fur seals in temperate latitude rookeries. Modern fur seals have recently established new rookeries at temperate latitude sites, such as San Miguel Island off southern California. But those seals came from Pribilof stock and still retain the reproductive behavior of Pribilof Island fur seals, Newsome said.</p><p>The long-term maternal strategy, seen in sea lions and most other eared seals, is believed to be driven by periodic disruptions of temperate marine ecosystems, such as El Niño events, he said. A shortage of food during an El Niño could mean death for newly weaned seal pups, but species with the flexibility to continue nursing for longer than one year can keep their pups alive. </p><p>According to Koch, these findings raise difficult questions for conservation biologists.</p><p>"It's an incredible behavioral change over time--there is no modern population of northern fur seals that does what these animals did in the past," Koch said. "So where is it natural for this animal to be? Has the species lost the behavioral diversity it needs to be successful here in California, or is it possible for them to reevolve that capacity?"</p><p>The study also raises broader questions about the natural ecosystem of the California coast, he said.</p><p>"We think now of sea lions, harbor seals, and elephant seals as the natural inhabitants of the California coast. But how did those species interact with fur seals, and how did the ecosystem work in the past when fur seals were more abundant? We still don't know what it was like, but I suspect California was really different when these animals were here in the past," Koch said.</p><p>The researchers are now incorporating genetics into the investigation, extracting DNA from ancient fur seal bones and analyzing it to reconstruct the genetic diversity of prehistoric populations of northern fur seals and estimate the total size of the population a millennium ago.</p><p>This research was supported by funding from the National Science Foundation and student research grants from the Myers Oceanographic and Marine Biology Trust, Long Marine Laboratory, and the PADI Foundation.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Notes to reporters:</b> You may contact Newsome at (202) 478-8987 or snewsome@ciw.edu; Gifford-Gonzalez at (831) 459-2633 or dianegg@ucsc.edu; Koch at (831) 459-5861 or pkoch@pmc.ucsc.edu; and Costa at costa@biology.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915203618072704601a012ff232abed0"><name>1323</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Staff Appreciation Breakfast draws crowd to Cowell Dining Hall</title><summary>Music filled the air as an ample breakfast buffet filled the plates of more than 1,100 people gathered for the annual Staff Appreciation Breakfast on May 15. &#13;

(To request an appointment, use the online request form <a href="http://chancellor.ucsc.edu/hours.shtml">available online</a>.) </p><p>Blumenthal and SAB chair-elect (next year's chair) Eric Grabiel gave certificates of thanks to the four outgoing Staff Advisory Board members, Judy Scarborough, Heather Metz Egli, Kitty Woldow and Pamela Edwards.</p><p>An always-popular part of the staff breakfast, raffle prizes, became even more popular this year as the number of prizes grew to double last year's total. Prizes included a gift basket from the staff in Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action and Title IX; Shakespeare Santa Cruz tickets; a three-month Wellness Card; and four $100 gift certificates to local businesses such as Starbucks, Clouds, Crow's Nest, and Trader Joe's. Blumenthal gave an "Out to Lunch" certificate good for lunch with the chancellor and Assistant Chancellor Ashish Sahni. </p><p>Providing entertainment was the Rolling Cultivators band, made up of Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems staff members. The band played waltzes, Irish jigs and reels, old-time fiddle tunes, bluegrass and contra dance tunes. Getting in the spirit of the event, band members decided to donate their performance fee to the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915204cb8072704601a012ff23258d16"><name>1324</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Three major events on campus on Tuesday, May 22</title><start-date>1179817200000</start-date><display-name>Three major events on...</display-name><path>/2007/05/1324</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/05/1324</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338325604</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338325604</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Tuesday will be an especially busy--and stimulating--day on the UCSC campus, as three major events are taking place in the afternoon and early evening.

The pact affects approximately 14,300 UC service and patient care employees earning less than $40,000 per year, and represents a total cost to the university of approximately $8.9 million.</p><p> </p><p>The agreement, effective April 1, 2007, pays particular attention to the needs of nearly 3,000 UC custodians on three UC campuses. UCSC, as the following details indicate, is one of those campuses:</p><p>. Custodians at UCSC, UCB, UCSB shall receive a $1.25 per hour increase, followed by a $0.50 per hour increase on October 1, 2007, for a total wage increase of $1.75 per hour.</p><p>. Custodians at other UC campuses (except UCSF Medical Center) shall receive a $0.50 per hour base-building wage increase.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to special raises for custodians, other AFSCME-represented employees shall receive the following:</p><p>. Employees earning less than $30,000: 2% salary increase</p><p>. Employees earning $30,000 - $34,999: 1% salary increase</p><p>. Employees earning $35,000 - $39,999: 0.5% salary increase</p><p>This agreement has other benefits to our campus people. Last September, I set aside funds to raise the wages of ALL of the staff employees at UCSC who are compensated the least. In other words, in addition to the agreements reached systemwide, we as a campus have begun to boost the compensation of these staff employees.</p><p>Now that the AFSCME agreement has been reached, people represented by that union will be eligible for the same UCSC-based increases that we have begun to provide to others in those salary ranges.</p><p>The UCSC campus increases, which are retroactive to October 1, 2006, will:</p><p>. Raise the minimum full-time annual salary rate on the campus to $25,000.</p><p>. Provide equity increases from 1 to 4 percent, depending on salary level, to individuals earning $25,000 and $35,000 a year.</p><p>Again, I am very pleased that this latest agreement has been reached, and that we can implement the campus increases as well for these very deserving staff members.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9152080d8072704601a012ffef9de18c"><name>1326</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz celebrates 40 years of leadership in sustainable agriculture and organic farming</title><summary>Decades before Wal-Mart began selling organic food, a charismatic Englishman and a group of students transformed a brush-covered hillside at the University of California, Santa Cruz, into a lush garden where vegetables and flowers were grown without chemi</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>UCSC Farm &amp; Garden, agroecology, sustainability, organic, Patricia Allen, CASFS</keywords><description>Decades before Wal-Mart began selling organic food, a charismatic Englishman and a group of students transformed a brush-covered hillside at the University of California, Santa Cruz, into a lush garden where vegetables and flowers were grown without chemi</description><start-date>1180594800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz celebrates...</display-name><path>/2007/05/1326</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/05/1326</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338326468</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338326468</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/05/images/chadwick_alan.200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/05/images/chadwick_alan.200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>chadwick_alan.200.jpg</name><file-size>62292</file-size><width>200</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>English master gardener Alan Chadwick with UCSC students in 1967.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Decades before Wal-Mart began selling organic food, a charismatic Englishman and a group of students transformed a brush-covered hillside at the University of California, Santa Cruz, into a lush garden where vegetables and flowers were grown without chemical pesticides or fertilizers.</p>
<p>Since that groundbreaking day in 1967, UCSC has become the "Harvard of organic farming," helping to transform the way food is grown, influence consumer trends and eating habits, and make "sustainability" a household word.</p>
<p>"We are small but mighty -- an incubator for innovation," said Sheldon Kamieniecki, dean of the Division of Social Sciences at UCSC. "Our influence proves you don't have to be a big ag school to have major impacts on farming and food distribution."</p>
<p>UCSC researchers pushed the envelope when they teamed up with farmers and pioneered the organic production of several key crops considered impossible to grow without synthetic inputs: strawberries, apples, artichokes, and cotton.</p>
<p>"When skeptics said 'You can't grow strawberries without fungicide,' our researchers teamed up with Jim Cochran of Swanton Berry Farm and said, 'Let's figure this out,'" said Patricia Allen, acting director of UCSC's Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS). "Now, organic strawberries are widely available in grocery stores."</p>
<p>Those breakthroughs in the field set the stage for cutting-edge work on sustainability: CASFS researchers have pushed the agenda of sustainability beyond ecological stewardship to address social justice issues of food production, such as the rights of workers to fair wages, decent working conditions, and access to healthy food. On a parallel track, natural scientists are conducting pioneering research to help farmers optimize the use of nutrients in organic production. "Today, Jim Cochran is at the forefront of the social justice side of sustainability by using union labor on his farms," noted Allen.</p>
<p>UCSC scholars and researchers are influential voices in the hottest debates of the day, from food safety and genetically modified crops to fair-trade principles and tension over "local versus organic" production. "We are continuing to shape the agenda," said Allen.</p>
<p>Considered by many the birthplace of organic agriculture, UC Santa Cruz will celebrate 40 years of leadership in sustainable food production and education when it hosts a public symposium July 28 (see the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1328">schedule of events</a>).</p>
<p>Among UCSC's leading contributions are the following:</p>
<p>. The Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) within the Division of Social Sciences generates trend-setting research and scholarship, including Allen's influential books, <em>Together at the Table: Sustainability and Sustenance in the American Agrifood System</em> and <em>Food for the Future.</em> Researchers have contributed numerous crop-production training manuals for Cooperative Extension agents in California, while faculty affiliates from the Environmental Studies Department and elsewhere on campus are conducting natural-science research that focuses on water-quality, nutrient-management, and insect-ecology issues within farming systems.</p>
<p>. The Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture has helped revitalize small-scale farming by providing hands-on training in organic production to more than 1,200 people, including students from Africa, Asia, and across the United States. (See <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1330">profiles of graduates</a>.) In addition, UCSC offers the only formal training in community-supported agriculture programs (CSAs). In January, the apprenticeship received a coveted Steward of Sustainable Agriculture Award from the Ecological Farming Association.</p>
<p>. The UCSC Farm is a 25-acre working organic farm run primarily by apprentice labor that also hosts organic field research trials, undergraduate education, community outreach events, the "Farm to Cafeteria" program, and the Life Lab Science Program, which has developed a garden-based science curriculum and worked with more than 1,400 schools across the United States.</p>
<p>. The UCSC Food Systems Working Group is a leader of the national farm-to-institution movement that is lobbying schools, colleges, hospitals, and other institutions to buy fresh food from local farmers. UCSC Dining Services is at the forefront of environmentally friendly practices within the UC system and beyond, serving a high percentage of local and organic produce in campus dining halls, recycling used cooking oil, and switching from a national to a local food distribution company to support the local economy and reduce fossil-fuel consumption.</p>
<p>. UCSC's influence on higher education is far-reaching. UC Davis, for example, has incorporated sustainability into its College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, while UCSC's training manuals and advice have helped establish campus-based farm education programs across the country, including at Washington State University, Colorado State University, the University of Georgia, the University of Montana, and Michigan State University. Last year, the campus helped found the National Sustainable Agriculture Education Group to boost the number and quality of such college and university programs.</p>
<p>"Today, the hillside where it all began beckons visitors to the Alan Chadwick Garden, and the spirit of innovation that first took root there has infused all that has come since," said Allen.</p>

Here is a brief timeline that shows the evolution of UCSC's leadership in sustainable agriculture.</p>
<p><strong>1967</strong></p>
<p>Alan Chadwick introduces organic, French intensive/biodynamic cultivation to the United States on a steep 4-acre site near UCSC's Stevenson College. He and a group of enthusiastic students lay the groundwork for what will become the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture.</p>
<p><strong>1971</strong></p>
<p>Organic production is introduced on a second site that will ultimately become the present 25-acre UCSC Farm. Run primarily by apprentice labor, the Farm supports an array of educational activities, including field research trials, undergraduate education, community events, a "Farm to Cafeteria" program that provides food to UCSC dining halls, and K-6 educational programs through the Life Lab Science Program, which is located on the Farm. It also generates about $120,000 a year in produce sales.</p>
<p><strong>1975</strong></p>
<p>The Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture is established as a yearlong program offered by UC Extension (streamlined to a six-month program in 1981).</p>
<p><strong>1980</strong></p>
<p>The Agroecology Program is established within the UCSC Division of Social Sciences, with an environmental studies faculty member as director, to integrate the apprenticeship's hands-on focus with academic research.</p>
<p><strong>1982</strong></p>
<p>The Alfred E. Heller Chair in Agroecology, UCSC's first endowed chair, is founded with a $375,000 gift from Alfred E. Heller. Environmental studies professor Stephen Gliessman becomes the first holder of the chair.</p>
<p><strong>1985</strong></p>
<p>The University of California provides permanent funding for the Agroecology Program.</p>
<p><strong>1993</strong></p>
<p>Center affiliate Patricia Allen's book <em>Food for the Future: Conditions and Contradictions of Sustainability</em> establishes a broader framework for discussions of agricultural "sustainability," encompassing resource depletion, toxins in the food chain, hunger, and farmers losing their land.</p>
<p><strong>1994</strong></p>
<p>The program becomes a formal university research center, supporting comprehensive food-systems research from a social science perspective and natural-science research related to organic and sustainable production systems with an emphasis on water-quality, nutrient management, and insect ecology. Renamed the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS).</p>
<p><strong>1997</strong></p>
<p>The first college textbook on agroecology is published by UCSC's Stephen Gliessman. <em>Agroecology: Ecological Processes in Sustainable Agriculture</em> provides the theoretical and conceptual framework for the study of the environment and agricultural systems.</p>
<p><strong>2004</strong></p>
<p>Allen, CASFS associate director for sustainable food systems, publishes <em>Together at the Table: Sustainability and Sustenance in the American Agrifood System,</em> which showcases movements to reconstruct the agrifood system to become more ecologically sound, economically viable, and socially just.</p>
<p>Center affiliate and UCSC professor of community studies Julie Guthman publishes <em>Agrarian Dreams: The Paradox of Organic Farming in California.</em> The first comprehensive study of organic farming in California, <em>Agrarian Dreams</em> shows how organic farming in the Golden State has replicated what it set out to oppose.</p>
<p><strong>2007</strong></p>
<p>The Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture receives a Steward of Sustainable Agriculture Award from the Ecological Farming Association in recognition of its 40-year contribution to sustainable agriculture.</p>
<p>The Breaking New Ground Symposium July 27-29 will showcase the impact UCSC has had in the field of sustainable agriculture, with speakers from programs at the cutting edge of sustainable agriculture and food systems -- all of which flowed from the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden, the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems, and the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture.</p>

Pister Leadership Opportunity Awards.</p><p>This year's recipients of the prestigious $20,000 scholarships include aspiring biologists and teachers, immigrants from Afghanistan and Hungary, and several students who are the first in their family to attend college. </p><p>"It is an honor to welcome these students to UCSC," said Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal. "Pister scholars are among the most dedicated of all students, and they set a high standard for their classmates."</p><p>The scholarships were established to help the most promising students from regional community colleges transfer to UCSC. All recipients receive a $10,000 scholarship for each of two years, as well as the support of a strong academic mentoring program and assistance finding paid summer work experience in a field that complements their studies. The program was designed by former UCSC Chancellor Karl S. Pister.</p><p>The scholarship program recognizes students who have made a demonstrated commitment to assisting and improving the lives of others, who have overcome adverse socioeconomic circumstances, and who might not otherwise be able to attend UCSC for financial reasons. Candidates are nominated by the presidents of each of 13 regional community colleges, and recipients are selected by the chancellor in consultation with the Leadership Opportunity Awards Program Screening Committee. </p><p>A list of this year's recipients follows, with hometowns and college affiliations. Biographical information about each recipient is also available below.

It was two years before they were reunited with their parents and two sisters. At the age of 19, she was the subject of an arranged marriage and came to the United States shortly thereafter. Today, as a Muslim woman, she is determined to pursue a degree in business management economics despite strong cultural prohibitions against women pursuing careers outside of nursing and teaching. Ansari has worked two part-time jobs to fund her education and has been an active member of the Mission College community. Her dream is to build a strong banking system in Afghanistan that will create jobs, stimulate foreign investment, and lift people out of poverty.</p><p></p><p>Bonnie Bea, Cupertino; De Anza College</p><p>A former foster youth, Bonnie Bea is a single parent juggling the responsibilities of family with work and education. She attributes much of her success to her involvement with the Independent Living Program, which prepares foster youth for emancipation. As an ILP facilitator, Bea shared her enthusiasm for higher education by helping many students apply to college. She also advocates for the needs of foster youth as a member of the Silicon Valley Children's Fund Youth Education Scholarship Advisory Committee. Bea plans to major in biochemistry at UCSC and pursue a career as a biomedical researcher.

Gode will major in mathematics and plans to be a professor.</p><p></p><p>Edgar Marin, Watsonville; Cabrillo College</p><p>One of 15 children, Marin came to the United States from Mexico at the age of two. Throughout his childhood, he and his siblings worked in the fields before and after school, during spring break, and over summer vacation. A Watsonville High School graduate, Marin enrolled at Cabrillo and intended to transfer to a four-year university, but family responsibilities and his father's death in 2000 put his plans on hold as he worked two, and sometimes three, jobs to help pay the bills. Since enrolling as a re-entry student, Marin has been a role model for others, tutoring fellow students and sharing his personal experiences with migrant students and others who are struggling with school. An avid reader, aspiring author, and talented guitarist, Marin is a literature major who is considering a career in teaching or counseling.</p><p></p><p>Hugo Rafael Mora, South San Francisco; College of San Mateo</p><p>With interests in psychology and philosophy, Mora is fascinated by human behavior. His own childhood was marked by family struggles, frequent moves, and friendships with troublemakers and drug users. Mora was in juvenile hall when he picked up Robert Fulghum's book <i>All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten,</i> which sparked his motivation and helped him stick with his probation officer's plans for him to finish high school and enroll at the College of San Mateo. Through force of will, Mora changed his life, making new friends, sitting in the front of the class, and joining clubs and study groups. As president of Latinos Unidos and an active participant in many campus activities and organizations, Mora has discovered leadership skills that will help him achieve his goal of earning a Ph.D. and becoming a psychologist.</p><p></p><p>Veronica Perez, San Jose; San Jose City College</p><p>The daughter of immigrants who worked as custodians and cannery workers, Veronica Perez knows the sacrifices parents make for their children.

He has played drums for eight years and recently started giving lessons.</p><p></p><p>Liset Vargas, Hollister; Gavilan College</p><p>An aspiring pharmacist, Liset Vargas has worked two jobs to put herself through school. She plans to major in biology at UCSC and looks forward to serving the Spanish-speaking community. The daughter of Mexican immigrants who didn't get beyond junior high school, Vargas has always been encouraged by her parents to attend college. At Gavilan, Vargas has been a tutor and mentor to her fellow students, and she helped develop a college club for students interested in careers in medicine.</p><p></p><p>Jennifer Lorainne Yee, Salinas; Hartnell College</p><p>As an instructional aide with the Monterey County Office of Education, Jennifer Yee worked one-on-one with special education students and discovered a strong interest in psychology. Financially independent since the age of 16, she began taking night classes at Hartnell two years after graduating from high school and recently switched to day classes to accelerate her education.

UCSC's environmental achievements will be catalogued, and our current policies and practices measured against the University of California Office of the President's Policy on Sustainable Practices and other generally accepted sustainability criteria.</p><p>This assessment will provide an accessible record of UCSC's continuing achievements in environmental leadership, as well as identifying opportunities for improvement.</p><p>A crucial element of this assessment - as well as future efforts to document our activities and performance as we strive to become more sustainable - is the involvement of interested parties.  The assessment will look for insight and information among individuals involved in all aspects of teaching, research and campus operations.  The Assessment team will contact your departments in advance of any necessary meetings and those interactions will be as streamlined and efficient as possible. The majority of the work will involve providing data that will be used by the Assessment team to develop the draft document and vetting the drafts for accuracy.</p><p>The project is currently supported by the Advisory Committee for Facilities, which is comprised of the Deans, Vice Provosts, Vice Chancellors, students and other representatives. ACF reports directly to the Chancellor and CP/EVC.</p><p>We encourage you to contact the assessment's project team if you have questions about how you might participate. Please direct inquiries to the Project Manager, Marcia Aurora Winslade at: <a href="mailto:marciaw@ucsc.edu">marciaw@ucsc.edu</a></p><p></p><p>I look forward to the results of this effort.</p><p>Campus Sustainability Assessment Team:</p><p>* Project Director - Ilse Kolbus, Director of the Physical Plant and Chair</p><p>  of the Campus Sustainability Subcommittee</p><p>* Project Manager - Marcia Aurora Winslade, </p><p>* Chancellor's Undergraduate Intern - Laura Kelly, ENVS student</p><p>* Project Consultant - Joshua Skov, Good

Because our brains are hard-wired to reassure us, most of the time we don't even realize the psychological gymnastics that are taking place.</p><p>Which is precisely the problem, according to preeminent social psychologist Elliot Aronson, coauthor of the new book <i>Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me): Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts</i> (New York: Harcourt, 2007). </p><p>In <i>Mistakes Were Made</i>, he and coauthor Carol Tavris spell out how the protective psychological mechanism of self-justification puts us on a slippery slope of self-deception that frequently gets us into enormous trouble when we are unable to acknowledge our mistakes.</p><p>A lively and engaging book, <i>Mistakes Were Made</i> is packed full of examples of people who've been ensnared by the all-too-human trap of self-justification. The authors chronicle President Bush's inability to change course in the war against Iraq despite the absence of weapons of mass destruction and the escalating financial and human costs, and they discuss how rank-and-file soldiers gradually came to mistreat prisoners at Abu Ghraib and why prosecutors refuse to drop charges against wrongfully convicted criminals after new DNA evidence establishes their innocence.</p><p>The stakes are highest for public figures because their actions affect the lives of so many, but the phenomenon is the same for us all, said Aronson, a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p><p>"Self-justification relieves cognitive dissonance and helps us sleep at night," said Aronson. "We're hard-wired this way because it smoothes our path a little bit. But we need to be vigilant so we're able to acknowledge our serious mistakes before we paint ourselves into a corner." </p><p>Most of the time, explained Aronson, the largely unconscious process of self-justification is harmless--it relieves the tension we experience after making minor social blunders and embarrassing gaffes. But it can have high personal and professional costs when we ignore our "blind spots" and attempt to justify foolish beliefs, bad decisions, and harmful actions. "We need to be vigilant so we're able to acknowledge our serious mistakes and learn from them," he said. "That's how we change destructive behavior and avoid making the same mistakes again and again."</p><p>In a famous laboratory experiment that illustrated the consequences of self-justification, two-thirds of participants administered what they thought were life-threatening levels of electric shock to another person, simply because the experimenter kept saying, "The experiment requires that you continue." The experiment, designed by social psychologist Stanley Milgram as a study of obedience to authority, is a chilling example of the chain reaction of behavior and self-justification that ensnares people, making ordinary people capable of immoral and harmful conduct. </p><p>Importantly, the electric shock experiment also highlights the step-by-step process that can lead us far from behavior we believe to be right or moral. "If Milgram had initially asked participants to administer a life-threatening shock of 450 volts to another person, almost all of them would have refused to obey," said Aronson. "But because he started them off with a small shock, and gradually increased the voltage, the participants justified each step along the way until the great majority were administering 450 volts."</p><p>"Self-justification helps us sleep well at night, but sometimes we shouldn't sleep well. I think we would all be better off, for example, if President Bush opened his eyes to reality even if it meant he might lose a little sleep," said Aronson, who has nearly 50 years of experience researching cognitive dissonance theory. </p><p>Aronson and Tavris devote two chapters to the role of self-justification in marriage and family life, illuminating the devastating consequences of self-righteous self-justification in such private arenas. "Most family rifts are caused or exacerbated by each party refusing to believe that he or she may be wrong. Each of us must strive to become aware of this tendency we all share," said Aronson. "Awareness of the process is the first step toward changing behavior. It's not easy, but it's doable." </p><p>Although the United States is a "mistake-phobic culture" that equates mistakes with incompetence and stupidity, Aronson believes institutions can be designed to reward admissions of mistakes. "Admitting wrongdoing allows psychological healing and sets the stage for better decisions in the future," said Aronson, recounting the experience of a junior executive at IBM who was responsible for a failure that cost the company $10 million. When IBM's legendary founder Tom Watson Sr. called the man into his office, the employee nervously said, "I guess you want my resignation?," to which Watson replied, "You can't be serious. We've just spent $10 million educating you!"</p><p>"If we want more people to take responsibility for their mistakes and then strive to correct them, we must start rewarding admissions of mistakes rather than make it uncomfortable for people to own up to them," said Aronson.</p><p>#####</p><p>Editor's Note: Aronson may be reached via e-mail at elliot@ucsc.edu or by calling Jennifer McNulty in the UCSC Public Information Office at (831) 459-2495.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91521dd88072704601a012ffc0092f40"><name>1342</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Colloquium features research by students in Faculty Mentor Program</title><summary>Undergraduate students who participated in the 2007 Faculty Mentor Program will present their research at a colloquium on June 5 and 6.</summary><keywords>Faculty Mentor Program</keywords><description>Undergraduate students who participated in the 2007 Faculty Mentor Program will present their research at a colloquium on June 5 and 6.</description><start-date>1180335600000</start-date><display-name>Colloquium features research by...</display-name><path>/2007/05/1342</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/05/1342</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338332073</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338332073</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Undergraduate students who participated in the 2007 Faculty Mentor Program will present their research at a colloquium on June 5 and 6 from noon to 3:30 p.m. in the Cervantes and Velazquez Room D at the Bay Tree Conference Center.

During that time he has served Chancellors Denton and Blumenthal and provided important transitional support between their two administrations. With the current year approaching its final month, the campus provost discusses one priority that has remained constant during his two years in his current position.</p><p><b>What do you consider to be the most important work you have done as campus provost?</b></p><p>I think the most important work on my desk during these two years has been the task of overseeing the development of a <a href="http://planning.ucsc.edu/acadplan/docs/AcadPlan.Mar07.Draft.pdf">campus academic plan</a>. The campus has been engaged in ongoing planning efforts for a number of years. However, we have been challenged in our ability to integrate those plans into an overall vision for the campus--one that builds on our strengths, identifies our distinctions, establishes priorities, and considers the regional programs that have been initiated in the Silicon Valley and Monterey.  </p><p>In the period of rapid enrollment growth experienced during the past decade, we often had the luxury of new money coming to the campus to support new programs and interests. As we prepare for more measured growth in the coming decade, careful consideration of how we use our resources will be necessary to achieve our most critical goals. </p><p><b>Can you describe the plan and the new directions it identifies for the campus?</b></p><p>In brief, the academic plan reflects the interests of the faculty and their scholarship priorities. In preparing the draft plan, we examined the current academic strengths across the campus, the plans of departments and divisions for future faculty hires, the prospects for new programs, and the needs of the state. From that process, we identified six broad areas around which the campus interests coalesce. These are:  a) technology and its impact on society; b) public documentation and communication; c) science and policy of evolving environments; d) human health; e) cross-cultural initiatives; and 6) transnationalism and globalization. This approach enables us to support our traditional programs but build new programs in a way that maximizes the impact we can have in these areas. This approach also plays to one of the campus's true strengths: our legacy of collaborative work in research and instruction, performed across disciplinary boundaries.</p><p><b>How close to final is this plan?</b></p><p>An academic plan is never finished because the nature of the academic enterprise is dynamic-always changing as new areas of knowledge emerge, economies fluctuate, societal needs change, and student interest moves us in new directions.  </p><p>The planning process has been iterative over the last two years. It started with the faculty, the Deans then worked to unite departmental plans into divisional plans. Vice Provost Alison Galloway has taken the lead on consulting with the Deans, the Academic Senate, and other campus constituents to develop the campus plan. Vice Provost Galloway is now working on an implementation component to the plan, which should be finalized for campus review sometime in fall quarter.</p><p><b>Will there be opportunities for other members of the campus community to provide input?</b></p><p>I welcome broad review of the Academic Plan; please encourage others to view the current draft. Members of the campus community can e-mail comments to me at: <a href="mailto:cpevc@ucsc.edu">cpevc@ucsc.edu</a>. </p><p><b>There have been periods when the campus functioned without an academic plan. It may seem obvious, but why do you think it matters so much?</b></p><p>It's not always obvious, but the academic plan helps us to understand where we want to go, and will help guide our actions to ensure we get there. The academic plan is important because it lays out the choices we face, the options we should consider, the costs in financial and academic terms, and which options appear to best serve the campus community. We need to build a collective understanding that we may need to forgo some of the things we want in order to support those things that are more important. The academic plan helps us understand the tradeoffs that will be inherent in the decisions we make. But more importantly it helps us identify opportunities to work across traditional boundaries and leverage existing resources so that the resulting academic program will be more than the sum of its parts. </p><p>Another reason to care about our academic plan is that we are about to launch our first comprehensive fundraising campaign. We train students to be good stewards of the environment, to utilize technology in exploring the universe, to understand how globalization affects our lives, to appreciate how creativity and artistic expression enriches our lives, and to understand ourselves, our health, and our societies. We want people outside of our immediate community to understand the impact of our work so they will want to contribute financially to support that work.</p><p><b>After two years in this position, what do you like most about your current job?</b> </p><p>When I was interviewing for faculty positions early in my career, I was persuaded to come to Santa Cruz because I believed that it offered an opportunity to be part of a community that shared my values, where I could engage in work I found interesting, where I found colleagues I respected, and students who were engaged and committed. After 35 years, the things that brought me here are the same things that energize me in my current position.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915224c48072704601a012ffeb75dc60"><name>1346</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Another agreement is reached to improve campus wages</title><start-date>1180335600000</start-date><display-name>Another agreement is reached...</display-name><path>/2007/05/1346</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/05/1346</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338333810</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338333810</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I was very pleased to learn that UC and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) reached an agreement last week to increase the wages of service and patient care employees earning less than $40,000 per year. The pact affects approximately 14,300 employees systemwide, which includes about 500 employees at UCSC. The agreement also releases the campus funds I set aside last September to improve the wages of UCSC staff who earn less than $35,000 annually.</p><p>In summary, the UC/AFSCME agreement provides the following wage increases for service and patient care staff on the Santa Cruz campus:</p><p>October 1, 2006</p><p>* Raise the minimum full-time annual salary rate on the campus to $25,000.</p><p>* Provide equity increases from 1 to 4 percent, depending on salary level, to individuals earning between $25,000 and $35,000 a year.</p><p>April 1, 2007</p><p>* For Custodians, $1.25 per hour increase</p><p>* For other service and patient care employees earning less than $30,000,</p><p>2% salary increase</p><p>* For other service and patient care employees earning $30,000-$34,999, 1%</p><p>salary increase</p><p>* For other service and patient care employees earning $35,000-$39,999,</p><p>0.5% salary increase</p><p>October 1, 2007</p><p>* For Custodians, $0.50 per hour increase</p><p>In addition, service employees are scheduled to receive a 4% increase on October 1, 2007, provided the funding is allocated to the University as a general range adjustment pursuant to the State Budget Act as finally adopted.</p><p>Similar increases are already being implemented for clerical employees represented by CUE, and for non-represented staff and academic employees.

CruzPay, the Enterprise Time and Attendance System on the UCSC</p><p>campus, was implemented in August 2006 with nearly 1600 Staff employees</p><p>using CruzPay to report time worked and leave taken.  We are now embarking</p><p>on the next phase which will bring additional functionality and student</p><p>employees into the system.</p><p>Electronic Workflow will allow employees and supervisors to submit and approve timesheets on-line, with no need to print paper copies. Electronic Workflow will be phased in for current staff employees using CruzPay beginning Summer 2007.  For most employees currently using the system the only change will be no longer printing their timesheet.  Employees and supervisors will be notified individually of the change in their time reporting and will receive instructions on how to electronically submit and approve timesheets.</p><p>Student employees in non-academic positions are scheduled to begin using CruzPay during the Winter Quarter 2008.</p><p>Additional details about CruzPay Phase 2 can be found on our web site: <a href="http://cruzpay.ucsc.edu">http://cruzpay.ucsc.edu</a>. We will continue to update this site as the project progresses and encourage you to visit this site to stay informed.</p><p>The CruzPay project team in conjunction with the SHR Service Teams is dedicated to making the CruzPay experience a positive one.</p><p>If you have any questions regarding the CruzPay plans, please send email</p><p>to: <a href="mailto:cruzpay_help@ucsc.edu">cruzpay_help@ucsc.edu</a></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>Staff and Faculty</audience><admin>CruzPay Project Team</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915228958072704601a012ff981fc5ed"><name>1350</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Annual Call--Performance Appraisals/Performance Management Program</title><start-date>1179903600000</start-date><display-name>Annual Call--Performance Appraisals/Performance Management...</display-name><path>/2007/05/1350</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/05/1350</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338334809</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338334809</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I write to announce the annual call for performance appraisals. Performance appraisals are required annually for all career employees and are an essential component of a successful performance management program. I ask for your full participation in making this a record year in the performance appraisal completion rate for each division.</p><p>As we have all agreed, moving to a comprehensive and standardized program of performance management is an important goal for the campus, one that will have significant benefits for our employees.  For the 2006-07 review period (July 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007) new forms (<a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/perf-appraisal-live.htm">http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/perf-appraisal-live.htm</a>) have been recently introduced to the campus and are provided on-line.  I strongly encourage principal officers to establish divisional guidelines that outline expectations for performance review and establish requirements for the use of the standardized forms.  Your division may choose to designate one or more specific forms to be used, depending upon the job responsibilities of employees being reviewed.</p><p>Completed and signed performance appraisals should be submitted to the appropriate service team in Staff HR by August 15, 2007.  Managers and supervisors who leave for the summer months or supervise staff on summer furloughs may complete the required forms in May or June in order to meet the August 15 deadline.</p><p>The completion of the performance appraisal is an important final step in the 2006-07 performance management program.  Please note that the Merit Program for Non-represented Staff will be implemented this fall as a performance-based program.  The ratings for the merit program will be directly linked to the performance appraisals you complete.  Additional information on this program will be communicated to managers, supervisors, and employees as details are finalized.</p><p>This announcement is being sent to all managers, supervisors, staff, and faculty who supervise staff.  For further information regarding the performance management process, please contact your service team (<a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/hrst/hrst_locate-team.htm">http://shr.ucsc.edu/hrst/hrst_locate-team.htm</a>) or Senior HR Partner Cecile Morris (ext. 9-3935 or <a href="mailto:cecile@ucsc.edu">cecile@ucsc.edu</a>).

These online surveys will run until Friday, June 15. To take these surveys, please point your Internet browsers to the following addresses:</p><p>* Purchasing: <a href="http://survey.ucsc.edu/BAS/Purch2007">http://survey.ucsc.edu/BAS/Purch2007</a></p><p>* Staff Human Resources: <a href="http://survey.ucsc.edu/BAS/SHR2007">http://survey.ucsc.edu/BAS/SHR2007</a></p><p>Each survey should take less than ten minutes. Results of the surveys will be posted on the Business and Administrative Services (BAS) web site (<a href="http://bas.ucsc.edu/performance">http://bas.ucsc.edu/performance</a>) by July 13.</p><p>As most of you know, the Business Transformation Program that took place in 2005-06 resulted in the consolidation of several business functions: purchasing, staff human resources, vendor payment, and employee reimbursement. The three central organizations that now provide these functions -- Purchasing, Staff Human Resources, and the Financial Administrative Services and Transactions (FAST) Office -- have now been operational for eighteen months. During that period, their staff have attempted to provide campus constituents with the services they need to carry out the university's mission. Now is your opportunity to tell Purchasing and Staff Human Resources how they're doing. (The FAST Office survey will be sent out to approximately 200 randomly selected users in June.)</p><p>We in Business and Administrative Services take customer feedback very seriously. Annual surveys are an important part of improving our processes and procedures, and we thank you in advance for your participation in this process.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Academic and Staff Employees</audience><admin>Vice Chancellor Tom Vani</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a27502888072704601a012ffc01d830c"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2007/05/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/05/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282625831441</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282625831441</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a27502888072704601a012ffc01d830c"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2007/05/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/05/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282625831441</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282625831441</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
