The Center of Excellence establishes a collaborative partnership between Sun and UCSC faculty who are working with the OpenSPARC community. </p><p>"UCSC is truly pioneering a new approach to processor development by leveraging open source technologies to drive innovation," said Kim Jones, vice president of global education and sales at Sun. "We anticipate that their efforts will not only deliver great benefits to the OpenSPARC community, but also positively impact the future course of how all microprocessors are designed."</p><p>The OpenSPARC initiative began in 2006 when Sun released the underlying design of its UltraSparc T1 processor (also known as "Niagara") under the terms of a General Public Licence (GPL). The move extends to chip design the basic concept of open-source software, which makes the underlying source code for a software program freely available so that other software developers can modify and improve the program. </p><p>With OpenSPARC, the idea is that releasing the hardware source code of the processor (known as the RTL) will enable software developers to create innovative derivatives, tools, and applications faster and with a higher degree of hardware integration than ever before, while providing unique, high-value solutions for specific markets. As of February 25, 2007, there have been more than 4,500 downloads of the OpenSPARC T1 RTL.</p><p>UC Santa Cruz is the first OpenSPARC Center of Excellence. Jose Renau, an assistant professor of computer engineering at UCSC, serves on the OpenSPARC community governance board. </p><p>"We have several projects at UCSC that are relevant to OpenSPARC. The Center of Excellence will advance our work in this area by strengthening our relationship with Sun," Renau said.</p><p>Renau's expertise is in computer architecture and microprocessor design. His projects include an architectural simulator that models a wide set of architectures and can be used for SPARC simulation. This and other projects will benefit from Sun servers and other equipment obtained through the Center of Excellence, Renau said. New equipment will also allow Renau and other faculty to use OpenSPARC in various computer engineering courses.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Renau at (831) 459-1847 or renau@soe.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9150e9848072704601a012ff5a610f43"><name>1073</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz students see stars, thanks to local company</title><author>Louise Donahue, (831) 459-5312, ldonahue@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>telescope</keywords><start-date>1172732400000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz students...</display-name><path>/2007/03/1073</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/03/1073</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338253133</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338253133</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Louise Donahue</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-5312</phone><email>ldonahue@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/03/images/telescopegift.220.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/03/images/telescopegift.220.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>telescopegift.220.jpg</name><file-size>19130</file-size><width>220</width><height>309</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>With two of the telescopes are, from left, Patrick Gillis of Orion Telescopes, Rachel Dewey, associate adjunct professor in astronomy and astrophysics, and UCSC student Rion Parsons.

"This gift means many more possibilities for students to have actual hands-on experience," said Rachel Dewey, associate adjunct professor in astronomy and astrophysics. "I also expect the telescopes will be used in some of the K-12 outreach programs UCSC participates in."</p><p>All of the donated telescopes are "Dobsonian," a style named for John Dobson, an amateur astronomer who developed and popularized the concept. Dobsonians are widely appreciated for their mounting system, which makes transportation and setup easy and reliable. </p><p>"Orion is the recognized industry leader in Dobsonian telescopes," said Patrick Gillis, who manages Orion's worldwide reseller division. "We saw this support as a wonderful opportunity for us to continue our partnership with an outstanding research university." </p><p>Orion has also cosponsored an astronomy conference at UCSC and donated binoculars for use by the Predatory Bird Research Group.</p><p>Orion's gift comprises eight Skyquest XT8 telescopes and two Skyquest XT10" IntelliScopes, along with cases to protect the telescopes in storage and transportation. Both models have similar optical quality, but the IntelliScope includes a computerized locator with more than 14,000 objects in its database. "The user enters a target, such as a specific galaxy," said Gillis, "and the object locator will guide the viewer to the target. The computer can also sort by category, such as planets, galaxies, or nebulae to help the viewer learn and enjoy the night sky." Because the IntelliScope is moved to its target by hand, rather than utilizing a motor, the mechanisms are more durable.</p><p>"These are robust telescopes," said Dewey. "I would expect that if we're as careful as we intend to be, students will be viewing with these telescopes for the next 15 years or more."</p><p>                                   ###</p><p>A high-resolution version of the photo above is available <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/img/2007/03/telescopegift.large.jpg.zip">here</a></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9150eb318072704601a012ff86763248"><name>1074</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>CruzTime and CruzMail Maintenance</title><author>ITS Support Center</author><start-date>1172732400000</start-date><display-name>CruzTime and CruzMail Maintenance...</display-name><path>/2007/03/1074</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/03/1074</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338253525</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338253525</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>To prepare for the early arrival of Daylight Savings Time, Information Technology Services (ITS) will conduct maintenance work on the campus calendar system, CruzTime, and on the campus email system, CruzMail, beginning this Friday, March 2.</p><p>Specific maintenance outage information follows:</p><p>On Friday, March 2, from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. the campus calendar system, CruzTime, will be taken off-line for operating system patches.

The concert, a fundraiser for the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden, will begin at 8 p.m. Tickets are available at The Attic for $15 in advance or $18 on the day of the show. The Attic is located at 931 Pacific Avenue in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>City Folk, a "mostly acoustic" trio with Keith Greeninger, Kimball Hurd, and Roger Feuer, came together in the late 1980s and quickly became known for their song writing, seamless three-part vocal harmonies, and musical arrangements. The group, which released three albums, performs rarely since their final national tour in 1995.</p>
<p>Feuer plays lead guitar, while Greeninger sings lead vocal and plays rhythm guitar. Hurd also sings lead vocal and plays a variety of instruments, including guitar, mandolin, mandola, banjo, and dobro.</p>
<p>A popular singer/songwriter, Fineman has recorded three CDs, <em>Cup of Kindness</em>, <em>Better With Time</em>, and <em>Closing the Distance: Poems, Prayers and Love Songs</em>. Fineman was voted "Best Folk Musician" four years running by the Monterey Bay's Coast Weekly newspaper. Her new CD, <em>Closing the Distance</em>, features contemporary arrangements of traditional and original songs from the Jewish diaspora. On <em>Closing the Distance,</em> produced and co-arranged by Alex de Grassi, Fineman sings in Hebrew, Ladino, and English.</p>
<p>The benefit concert is part of a yearlong celebration of UCSC's leadership in sustainable agriculture, which began with the founding 40 years ago of the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture. The nation's leading hands-on training program in organic farming and gardening, the apprenticeship is the oldest of the programs offered by the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems at UCSC. Widely regarded as one of the most significant influences in the growth of sustainable agriculture--some call it the birthplace of organic farming--the apprenticeship has prepared more than 1,200 graduates who have spread their expertise throughout the world.</p>

Following site-preparation work, construction on the homes will begin this fall. The first units are likely to be available for occupancy in fall 2008.</p><p>"Ranch View Terrace is not only critical to our efforts to recruit and retain faculty and staff, it is responsive to community requests that we develop more housing on campus," said Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal.</p><p>When completed, the first phase of Ranch View Terrace will increase the stock of for-sale housing on campus by more than 30 percent. UC Santa Cruz now offers 143 units of for-sale housing, predominantly condominiums and townhouses. In addition, 51 units at Laureate Court, across High Street from campus, are rented to faculty and staff members. </p><p>The Ranch View Terrace homes are designed to provide an increased inventory of available units for the many UC Santa Cruz faculty and staff members now on long waiting lists for on-campus for-sale housing. The 16 three-bedroom units will range from approximately 1,750 to 1,900 square feet, and the 29 four-bedroom units from approximately 2,000 to 2,100 square feet. Prices range from $479,000 to $655,000, not including buyer-selected upgrades.</p><p>"We have a lot of people who really want to buy at Ranch View Terrace," said Housing manager Steve Houser. "More than 200 people are on the waiting list for the new homes, including 31 people now living in other campus housing." A shift of some on-campus homeowners to Ranch View Terrace would also create vacancies in other campus housing, a goal of the Ranch View project.</p><p>The timing of the second phase of Ranch View Terrace, with an additional 39 homes, will depend on buyers' response to the first phase, Houser said. "If we have strong sales, the campus would likely opt to promptly proceed with Phase Two."</p><p>The development's on-campus location near the main campus entrance offers employees a convenient commute to work, with easy access to walking trails and bike paths to the core of the campus, as well as campus shuttle bus and city bus service. Built in clusters of six to eight homes, the units will face pedestrian pathways linking to common areas.</p><p>"Comfortwise" standards for energy and water conservation will be incorporated into the construction, and buyers may include additional energy-efficient options such as photovoltaic solar panels. </p><p>As with other campus for-sale projects, employee purchasers will lease the land from the University of California, and lease provisions will ensure that the homes remain at below-market value over time.</p><p></p><p>####</p><p></p><p>Note to reporters: A high-resolution artist's rendering of Ranch View Terrace is available <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/img/2007/03/ranch_view.jpg.zip"> here</a>.

But that is just what astronomers have now discovered. </p><p>The relation between a galaxy's mass and the orbital speed of its stars and gas is remarkably consistent over a wide range of galaxy morphologies and over billions of years of galaxy evolution, according to new results from a major survey of distant galaxies. The findings show that certain fundamental properties of galaxies have actually changed very little over the past 8 billion years (about half the age of the universe).</p><p>"We think this trend reflects a regularity in the process that led to the formation of galaxies. We are not sure where it comes from, but it is a major constraint on galaxy formation," said Sandra Faber, University Professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p><p>Simply put, the more massive a galaxy is, the faster the stars and gas within it move. Susan Kassin, a postdoctoral researcher working with Faber at UCSC, described this relation by analyzing new data from ground-based and space-based telescopes for 544 distant galaxies with a range of morphologies. The analysis involved a new way of measuring the internal dynamics of galaxies proposed by Benjamin Weiner, now at the University of Arizona, when he was a postdoctoral researcher at UCSC.</p><p>"By defining a new speed indicator, their analysis has managed to make sense out of very chaotic-looking objects," Faber said. "The galaxies almost magically fall into place."</p><p>The findings are an extension of the Tully-Fisher relation, which was established for nearby spiral galaxies nearly 30 years ago, Kassin said. She is first author of a paper describing the new findings to be published in a forthcoming special issue of <i>Astrophysical Journal Letters (ApJL)</i> devoted to initial results from the All-wavelength Extended Groth strip International Survey (AEGIS). AEGIS is a collaborative effort involving nearly 100 scientists in half a dozen countries, including 10 instrument teams, to provide deep imaging and spectroscopy at multiple wavelengths over a large area of sky. </p><p> </p><p>Kassin's study relied primarily on data from the Hubble Space Telescope, the DEIMOS spectrograph at the W. M. Keck Observatory, and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Her findings, together with other results from the AEGIS survey reported in the same issue of <i>ApJL,</i> are giving researchers the first comprehensive view of the final stages of galaxy formation and how galaxies took on their modern, mature forms, Faber said.</p><p>"We are now well on our way to seeing how galaxies evolved over the last half of the age of the universe," she said. "This work is not over, but the outlines of a theory are emerging."</p><p>The Tully-Fisher relation correlates the luminosity of a spiral galaxy with its rotational speed: The brighter the galaxy, the faster it rotates. Recent refinements of the Tully-Fisher relation have replaced luminosity with stellar mass. Kassin and her collaborators have now extended it back in time to show that it has remained the same even as galaxies have evolved and changed over billions of years. </p><p>The researchers looked at galaxies at redshifts ranging from 0.1 to 1.2, corresponding to "look-back" times of about 2 billion to nearly 8 billion years. In other words, the light now seen by telescopes left the galaxies 2 billion to 8 billion years ago, enabling astronomers to look back in time at earlier stages in the evolution of galaxies. "We are looking at galaxies in their adolescence," Kassin said.</p><p>These distant galaxies tend to be more disordered than nearby galaxies. Disks, for example, tend to be less fully formed than in nearby spiral galaxies, Kassin said. In order to fully capture the internal motions of these galaxies, the researchers included a "dispersion component" to capture disordered motion in addition to the rotational motion of a disk. The result was a tight relation between stellar mass and internal velocities, and this relation applied to all galaxy morphologies, including the disordered "train-wrecks" left after galaxies collide and merge with each other. </p><p>"Even train-wrecks fit this tight relation between the new speed indicator and the stellar mass of the galaxies, which is surprising. It indicates that there is a remarkable regularity to galaxies, irrespective of what they look like," Kassin said. </p><p>By extending the Tully-Fisher relation to include other galaxy morphologies in addition to spiral galaxies, the new analysis seems to encompass another famous scaling law for galaxies, the Faber-Jackson relation, which correlates the luminosity of elliptical galaxies with a measure of their disordered motions. This is remarkable because ellipticals and spirals represent two very different categories of galaxies. Elliptical galaxies are "old, red, and dead," with old populations of stars and no active star formation, whereas spiral galaxies are characterized by active star formation and blue light from young, hot stars. </p><p>"The Faber-Jackson relation is for red and dead galaxies that have finished star formation, and Tully-Fisher is for blue star-forming galaxies," said Faber, who codiscovered the Faber-Jackson relation in 1976. </p><p>Spiral galaxies are dominated by a large, flat, rotating disk of stars and interstellar matter, whereas the orbits of stars in elliptical galaxies are randomly oriented. Kassin and her collaborators have, in effect, combined the Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson relations by measuring both ordered rotation and scrambled motion for all galaxy types.</p><p>"We were truly surprised at how well the new speed indicator works," Faber said.</p><p>According to Faber, the relation described in this study may reflect processes that began in the first fraction of a nanosecond after the Big Bang. "Galaxies began life as quantum fluctuations--tiny density fluctuations that created the seeds for the later coagulation of structure in the universe. When gravity took over, those seeds made galaxies, and we think that process is reflected in the Tully-Fisher relation," she said.</p><p>Measurements of the internal kinematics of distant galaxies--the orbital velocities of their stars and gas--were essential to this study and required high-resolution spectra obtained by the DEIMOS spectrograph on the 10-meter Keck II Telescope. Equally important to the analysis were images of the galaxies obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope. The researchers also used photometric data from the 3.6-meter Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope to determine stellar masses. </p><p>The DEIMOS spectra and Hubble images are the backbone of the AEGIS project, which was organized by the DEEP2 Survey team led by Marc Davis of UC Berkeley. DEEP2 has used DEIMOS to obtain high-resolution spectra of 50,000 galaxies. AEGIS also includes data from many other ground-based and space-based telescopes, including the Spitzer Space Telescope, Chandra X-ray Observatory, the GALEX ultraviolet satellite, and the Very Large Array radio telescope.</p><p>In addition to Kassin, Weiner, and Faber, the coauthors of the new paper are David Koo, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC; Jennifer Lotz of the National Optical Astronomical Observatories; Juerg Diemand, Justin Harker, A.

The collaboration with HP provides new momentum to BIN-RDI programs, which are focused on the converging fields of biotechnology, information technology, and nanotechnology.</p><p>"This is a key step in the evolution of the BIN-RDI project," said UCSC Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal. "With HP on board, this initiative is achieving our vision of an interdisciplinary institute involving industrial and university research and operating at the forefront of technological innovation."</p><p>The collaboration with HP is a major milestone in a project that already involved NASA and UC scientists in Silicon Valley, said Carl Walsh, vice provost for Silicon Valley Initiatives and professor of economics at UCSC. "The BIN-RDI is one of the key initiatives in UCSC's overall plan to bring UC research and educational programs to Silicon Valley, and we are excited by the prospects this partnership offers," he said.</p><p>Building on UCSC's existing partnership with NASA Ames through the University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) in the NRP, the BIN-RDI is strategically positioned at the forefront of emerging technologies made possible by advances across a range of disciplines. Many experts view the convergence of biotechnology, information technology, and nanotechnology as the nexus of the next major technological revolution. As the institute's keystone industry affiliate, HP will help define the research agenda for the BIN-RDI and play a leading role on its industrial advisory board. </p><p>"BIN-RDI is an institution that has potential to have tremendous impact on a broad range of research we'll be pursuing in the future," said Stan Williams, HP senior fellow and director of quantum science research at HP Labs. </p><p>HP is setting an example for other Silicon Valley companies by demonstrating confidence in the institute's plans, according to David Lackner, director of the BIN-RDI Affiliates Program. "We're doing something truly different here, and HP is stepping up to show that it really believes in this," Lackner said.</p><p>William Berry, operations director of the BIN-RDI, said the partnership with HP helps to validate the BIN-RDI's underlying concept of having academic, government, and industry researchers working together in an open environment.</p><p>"We intend to be innovative in managing the intellectual property environment of the BIN-RDI's research program as an enabler for future broader participation in collaborations," Berry said.</p><p>The BIN-RDI provides a central "commons" area for research and development where intellectual property is shared among participating universities, companies, and government agencies. Adjoining the commons is transient, private laboratory space ("T-space") for proprietary research. This research architecture is designed to accommodate multi-sector partnerships for both start-up and established companies, and to foster rapid development of innovative discoveries and technologies. </p><p>In addition to endorsements from industry, the BIN-RDI has received substantial support from regional education leaders and state and federal elected officials. With critical assistance from Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Anna Eshoo, the initiative obtained $2 million in federal seed funding in 2006. HP is providing additional funding to support the institute's operations, and NASA has also made significant contributions. The institute is now moving into a new building, the Advanced Studies Laboratory, located in the NASA Research Park. </p><p>Current research activities at the BIN-RDI include projects on thermoelectric materials and fuel cell technology. The institute also aims to establish a Nano-Science Policy Institute and develop educational programs through the Collaborative for Higher Education, a partnership involving UCSC, San Jose State University, and Foothill-De Anza Community College District.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9150f7d28072704601a012ff6d4c2e57"><name>1082</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Third annual 'Writing Matters' conference for community educators to be offered by UC Santa Cruz Writing Project on March 24</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1173250800000</start-date><display-name>Third annual 'Writing Matters'...</display-name><path>/2007/03/1082</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/03/1082</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338256790</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338256790</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Education</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/03/images/freeman_susan.200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/03/images/freeman_susan.200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>freeman_susan.200.jpg</name><file-size>47146</file-size><width>200</width><height>231</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Susan Freeman, co-director of the Central California Writing Project (CCWP) at UCSC

</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Central California Writing Project (CCWP) at UC Santa Cruz will present the third annual "Writing Matters" conference-a symposium on literacy, equity, and social justice-on Saturday, March 24, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at UCSC's Oakes College.</p><p>The event is designed for K-12 teachers and school administrators in the Monterey Bay Area, as well as college and university students on their way to becoming professional educators. It will offer a wide variety of "best practices" workshops featuring instructional strategies and roundtable discussions on the teaching of writing, plus numerous networking opportunities and teaching resources. </p><p>"If you're a teacher of English-language learners, this symposium will give you new ideas and strategies to bring back to the classroom, as well as introduce you to the CCWP-a network of teachers dedicated to improving literacy in our schools," noted UCSC's CCWP codirector Susan Freeman. "We want to let community educators know that there's an organization at a UC campus that is very committed to providing outreach in public schools to support the teaching of writing."</p><p>The  CCWP at UCSC has worked with teachers, schools, and districts in Santa Cruz, San Benito, and Monterey Counties since 1977. It is one of 17 California Writing Project sites and an affiliate of the National Writing Project, a network of sites located in universities across the country. The UCSC site provides professional development, resources, and technical assistance through workshops, conferences, young writers camps, summer institutes, and partnerships with local schools. </p><p>Freeman said the "Writing Matters" conference would include workshops on strategies to help all students write well, particularly immigrant students and English learners. Workshops will examine issues of equity and access in the teaching of writing and include sessions on expository writing, using collage to develop vocabulary and comprehension, digital storytelling and the integration of technology into writing, poetry, and the use of the Socratic Seminar with high school students to spark critical thinking and writing in the classroom.</p><p>Freeman added that the CCWP will also partner with Pisces Moon Productions, a youth theater group in Santa Cruz, for a roundtable discussion at the symposium. "Their session will focus on the impact that writing, literature, and theater can have on students' understanding of controversial issues in the world and their ability to connect those issues to their own lives," Freeman said.</p><p>Andy Shapiro, a CCWP teacher at Main Street School in Soquel, will additionally be inviting symposium participants to join him in a dialogue about teachers writing in the public forum. Shapiro writes the weekly education column, "It Takes A Village," for the <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel.</i> "It will be a roundtable discussion of the importance of teachers writing about their own lives and what happens in the classroom," Freeman noted. "It's about how teachers can become writers-and a public voice in the discussion of education."</p><p></p><p></p><p>Registration for the "Writing Matters" conference is $40 through March 18 or $50 at the door. Students receive a discount at $25. For more information, call the CCWP at UC Santa Cruz, (831) 459-4506, or contact Carol Artman at cartman@ucsc.edu.

<p>The new system--Santa Cruz Tickets--is designed as a comprehensive community ticket office from which patrons can buy tickets to most local performances and events through one source, either online at <a href="http://www.santacruztickets.com">santacruztickets.com</a>, or in person at the City's Civic Auditorium Box Office, or the UCSC Ticket Office.</p>
<p>Tickets currently available through Santa Cruz Tickets include all performances of the Santa Cruz Symphony, Shakespeare Santa Cruz, Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music, UCSC Arts &amp; Lectures, UCSC Arts performances, and all Civic Auditorium events.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz Mayor Emily Reilly and UCSC Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal hailed Santa Cruz Tickets as another example of the city and university working together for the benefit of campus and city residents.</p>
<p>"This is an important step in developing cultural tourism as a fundamental part of our Santa Cruz economy," Mayor Reilly said. "Neither of our organizations could have done this alone, but by collaborating we've not only helped each other but also every ticket buyer and cultural organization in the community."</p>
<p>Acting Chancellor Blumenthal said Santa Cruz Tickets "brings immediate benefits to the community and the university and is further evidence of how UCSC and the city working together can achieve results that benefit us both. I want to acknowledge the outstanding and dedicated work of UCSC and city staff who made this ticketing system become a reality," Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz Tickets may also expand its services to offer a convenient outlet for community music and arts organizations in marketing their events.</p>
<p>The project is the culmination of two years of cooperative work by UCSC and city staff resulting in the joint purchase of the latest in sophisticated ticketing software, Audience View. The comprehensive software is being used by such organizations as the Children's Theater of Toronto; the city of Mesa, Ariz.; the Toronto Blue Jays; University of Minnesota; and MGM venues in Las Vegas.</p>

Two $500,000 grants will support the research of David Feldheim and Bin Chen, both assistant professors of molecular, cell, and developmental biology. </p><p>The UCSC awards are part of the first state-approved research grants focused solely on human embryonic stem cells. The CIRM will distribute grants totaling approximately $45 million over two years to researchers at 20 academic and nonprofit research centers throughout the state. The recipients were selected from among 231 applications for more than $138 million, received from 36 California institutions.</p><p>Because of their ability to generate many different cell types, human embryonic stem cells may potentially serve as a renewable source of cells for replacing the damaged cells in diseases such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)--a rapidly progressive, fatal neurological disease that leads to the degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Chen's research on molecular signaling and Feldheim's work on differentiation of these stem cells into motor neurons represent important steps in the exploration of whether cell replacement could be an effect treatment for ALS. </p><p>Bruce Margon, vice chancellor of research, noted that UCSC received significantly large awards from the CIRM for the stem cell research--particularly considering the fact that the campus does not have a medical school or the extensive health sciences research efforts now in progress at many other UC campuses. He said that UCSC does have strong programs in several areas of biomedical research, and the CIRM grants will allow the campus to expand in an exciting new direction. </p><p>Margon added that the research conducted at UCSC is critical to making a difference in the fight against chronic, debilitating neurological disease.   </p><p>"It makes me proud that the work here involves a direct attack on human suffering," said Margon. "ALS, for example, is an absolutely dreadful disease with no cure. The idea that right here on campus we are now pushing towards the solution is something that should make all in our community enormously proud."</p><p>Although voters originally approved a $3 billion program to fund stem cell research in California in 2004, lawsuits have until now delayed funding for this first research project of its kind in the nation. Shortly after the CIRM issued these first grants, a state appeals court upheld the program. The agency is slated to approve approximately 25 additional grants totaling $80 million sometime next month.</p><p>"We were amazed by the large number of applications that we received," said Robert N. Klein, chair of the governing board of the CIRM. "Because of their high quality, it was important to increase the number of awards and the amount of money granted. These projects will truly jump-start stem cell research in California."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9150fef08072704601a012ff80852877"><name>1088</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>ITS Service Announcement For CruzTime Users</title><start-date>1173423600000</start-date><display-name>ITS Service Announcement For...</display-name><path>/2007/03/1088</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/03/1088</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338258592</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338258592</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Last Friday, March 2, 2007, we installed the new Daylight Saving Time (DST) rules for 2007 and subsequent years on the CruzTime calendar system.</p><p>With this update in place, we now ask you to undertake a little maintenance on your end.</p><p>Please review meeting times which were already scheduled between the new and old DST start dates, and between the new and old DST end dates.

The bookstore will celebrate the publication of <i>Etched in Stone</i> with a public reception on Wednesday, March 28, at 7:30 p.m.</p><p>Included in the collection are familiar landmarks like the Thomas Jefferson Memorial and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, as well as lesser-known works such as the Slavery Monument in Savannah, Georgia, the Salem Village Witchcraft Victims' Memorial, and the Clayton Jackson McGhie Memorial in Duluth, Minnesota, a tribute to the victims of a lynching in 1920.</p><p>"I identified historical moments and people, and then looked for words etched in stone," said Coonerty. "I started with wars and social movements. At times, it was difficult because I don't think our monuments look like our country yet, in terms of racial and gender diversity." </p><p>Coonerty was inspired to create the book five years ago while living in Washington, D.C. "I was struck by the importance of the words that are etched in stone, and I started seeing them everywhere," he said. Traveling to other cities, Coonerty eventually compiled a list of nearly 125 eligible sites. "One of the joys of writing this book was discovering these new sites," he said. </p><p>Coonerty included the Native American petroglyphs of Newspaper Rock State Historic Monument in Utah in the book. "I found sites all around the country, but people were obviously here before the country was," he explained. "The idea of engraving words and images into stone dates back tens of thousands of years."</p><p>The World Trade Center Memorial is a work-in-progress that demonstrates the controversy and emotion that can accompany construction of a monument, noted Coonerty, describing the ongoing debate over the presentation of victims' names.</p><p>"Memorials today are being built shortly after the event," he said. "The Vietnam Memorial was built 20 years after the war, but with 9/11, the planning began right after the tragedy--the day after." Memorials are built to convey the feelings and emotions of the time, and they provide an outlet for grief, but they "have to last centuries, so they need a context," noted Coonerty.</p><p>The Washington, D.C., memorial to Franklin D. Roosevelt was designed 50 years after his presidency and offers a "different take" on his presidency than would've been possible immediately after his death, added Coonerty. </p><p>Although the National Mall in the nation's capital represents the most coveted acreage for memorials and monuments, Coonerty said Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood--the last entry in <i>Etched in Stone</i>--has a special place in the hearts of many. The sidewalk where dozens of movie stars have left their handprints and footprints in cement draws more than two million visitors each year. "It definitely deserves to be in the book," said Coonerty.</p><p><i>Etched in Stone</i> also includes a public-art project in Portland, Oregon, called Streetwise but known informally as the Talking Sidewalk. The brick walkway incorporates stones engraved with quirky quotations from the likes of Groucho Marx, Marilyn Monroe, and Albert Einstein. Set at odd angles to catch the attention of pedestrians, the engraved bricks evoke laughter and brief but uplifting interactions among the city's bustling crowds.</p><p>"For me, monuments are also about our public spaces, places where people can come together," said Coonerty. "The world is so disconnected today. We need places where we can come together in celebration or mourning."</p><p>In the introduction to the third chapter, entitled "Bearing Witness," which encompasses the Holocaust, the detention of Chinese immigrants at the Angel Island Immigration Station, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the blacklisting of Hollywood artists, the Oklahoma City bombing, and the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Coonerty writes: </p><p><i>The sites profiled in this chapter--memorializing the worst injustices and tragedies in the nation's history--attempt the nearly impossible task of providing meaning for acts that were often meaningless. By their nature these spaces must be a place for the living and the dead, a place of reconciliation for justice delayed and justice denied--a public space for private grief. These sites must be relevant when those who knew the victims have long since passed and their lives and loss are assigned to a few words inscribed on a wall, a bench, or a pedestal.</i></p><p>With a foreword by historian Douglas Brinkley, <i>Etched in Stone</i> also features the work of noted architectural photographer Carol Highsmith, as well as historical photographs from the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, and other eras.</p><p>Coonerty, who still works behind the register at his family's legendary independent bookstore in downtown Santa Cruz, said it's exciting to be a first-time author. "I grew up in a family where books and words are of the highest importance, so to be a part of that is fantastic," he said.</p><p>#####</p><p>A high-resolution photo of the cover of <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/img/2007/03/coonerty_cover.jpg.zip"><i>Etched in Stone</i></a> is available for download.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915102218072704601a012ff0b10566b"><name>1090</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New technology shows old faults are smoother than young ones</title><summary>A new study by UCSC geologists finds old earthquake faults are smoother than young ones, worn smooth over time by friction like the brake pads of an old car.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Emily Brodsky, earthquake faults</keywords><description>A new study by UCSC geologists finds old earthquake faults are smoother than young ones, worn smooth over time by friction like the brake pads of an old car.</description><start-date>1173682800000</start-date><display-name>New technology shows old...</display-name><path>/2007/03/1090</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/03/1090</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338259437</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338259437</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/03/images/fault.200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/03/images/fault.200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fault.200.jpg</name><file-size>50320</file-size><width>200</width><height>150</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The LIDAR instrument (foreground) scans an exposed fault in Dixie Valley, Nevada, measuring its topography in great detail.

Published in the March 2007 issue of <i>Geology,</i> the study shows the structure of mature faults differs significantly from that of young faults.</p><p>Emily Brodsky, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences, and postdoctoral researcher Amir Sagy used a new tool to create extraordinarily detailed topographical maps of the vertical sides of exposed fault lines. Their findings suggest that the age of a fault may influence the nature of the earthquakes it generates.</p><p>The idea that old and young faults have fundamentally different structures is not new. In fact, the idea that faults evolve has been around a long time. But fault structure is very difficult to measure quantitatively, Brodsky said. </p><p>"They're all relatively smooth surfaces. Therefore, what you're looking for are relatively subtle differences between the mature and immature faults. To do that you need a really good tool," she said.</p><p>Brodsky found that really good tool in laser imaging detection and ranging (LIDAR), a technology that has emerged in the last three years. Like radar, LIDAR sends out a pulse of energy and then records information from the reflections that bounce back to it. Rather than using radio waves, as radar does, LIDAR uses pulses of high-energy light, making it more sensitive than radar. </p><p>Earlier geologists studying the structures of faults had to rely on measuring cliff profiles with tape measures and metal bars. Often, this entailed climbing around on sheer rock faces in rappelling gear for hours to collect a very few measurements.</p><p>"That's really hard to do. You work all day and you get ten data points measured. We sit there for about an hour with our equipment and we get about a million data points," Brodsky said. </p><p>LIDAR scans enormous rock faces from the ground, taking a data point as frequently as every three millimeters. The LIDAR machine, which looks like an oversized computer printer perched atop a yellow tripod, folds up to fit in a large crate for transport. </p><p>Because the LIDAR machine is not exactly handheld (it weighs 50 pounds), Brodsky and Sagy had to be choosy about the faults they measured. Sagy researched faults from Santa Cruz and then went on road trips to scan them. He looked for faults that were easily measured, with significant amounts of rock bare above the surface.</p><p>"I would connect with geologists who had found beautiful faults," Sagy said. "It had to be a relatively large surface, larger than two square meters. But it also needed to be a place that was easy to get to by car."</p><p>In the end, it took Sagy almost two years to collect and analyze the data for approximately 15 sites in southern California, Oregon, Nevada, and Utah. Both Sagy and Brodsky say the results clearly show that, on a small scale, older faults are smoother than young faults. </p><p>Although mature faults tend to be smooth at small scales, the study also found that they have regular features on larger scales. They're like gravel roads over which countless cars have driven: The gravel has been pounded down into a semblance of smoothness, but a washboard pattern has emerged. Younger faults tend to be rough on all scales with no discernible patterns, like a new gravel road with rocks poking at all angles.</p><p>"The thing that was really surprising was that the mature faults have a really distinct structure, little hills on them, at the 10 meter scale. That's very surprising, because most geologists thought they were fractal," Brodsky said. </p><p>Fault lines have been cited as examples of fractal geometry, exhibiting the same structure and complexity regardless of the scale of observation. Sagy said an earlier study on this question by other scientists hadn't found evidence to support the idea that fault lines are fractal, but the researchers had chalked up their failure to inadequate equipment. Now, however, their findings have been confirmed by the more powerful LIDAR technique. </p><p>"Their data suggested that it wasn't fractal, but they thought it was the fault of their instrument," Sagy said. "In fact, they were right from the beginning."</p><p>Because the two types of faults are so different, Brodsky says, everything about the earthquakes these faults produce should be different: their birth, strength, and propagation. What these differences are and how they occur still isn't clear. Brodsky and Sagy hope to use their new knowledge of faults to study how a fault's structure affects the earthquakes it generates.</p><p>"We don't know how the amount of shaking from the same size earthquake acts on different kinds of faults. It could be that the smoother, mature faults give you a less bumpy ride," Brodsky said. "The next step is to work out what these predictions mean for earthquakes."</p><p>Sagy and Brodsky collaborated with Gary J.

The results also represent a powerful new tool for predicting the likely host range of pathogens, useful in agriculture, environmental restoration, and ecology.</p><p>Plant pathologist Gregory S. Gilbert, a professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and coauthor Campbell O. Webb of Harvard University's Arnold Arboretum report their findings in the paper "Phylogenetic Signal in Plant Pathogen Host Range," in the Monday, March 12, edition of the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</i></p><p>"Conventional wisdom holds that closely related plants are much more likely to share pathogens, but there's never been a systematic evaluation of that notion," said Gilbert, who devised a new method and evaluated the susceptibility of dozens of forest plant species to 53 pathogens, for a total of 962 fungus-plant combinations. "The risks are far greater than we expected. This research sounds an alarm and provides a new tool for evaluating risk."</p><p>Gilbert's findings confirm the conventional wisdom that plants within a genus are highly vulnerable to the same pathogens. More surprising, however, was that this vulnerability decreased gradually, with even the most distantly related flowering plants sharing a 27 percent chance of being susceptible to a given pathogen, according to Gilbert. "It is very surprising to see such a degree of shared vulnerability among plants that took different evolutionary paths over a hundred million years ago," said Gilbert. "With this new information, it's clear that arbitrary cutoffs at the genus or family level underestimate the risk substantially."</p><p>Such arbitrary cutoffs are currently the rule. For instance, in the United States, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has drafted a policy proposal that would restrict importing exotic plant species within the same genus as a known host of a pathogen currently under quarantine, until extensive further analysis could be conducted. "The APHIS model implies that plants outside the genus are not considered a risk, but that is at odds with the empirical data," said Gilbert. "We now know that significant risk extends far beyond the category of genus, and we can assign risk with far greater accuracy than before." With that information, regulators can make better-informed decisions and could focus their limited resources more efficiently on evaluating specific plant-pathogen combinations.</p><p>Gilbert's findings give scientists and policy makers a tool to predict whether plant pathogens are likely to be able to move from one plant species to another, when costly and time-consuming empirical data are not yet available. This tool may be useful beyond quarantine regulations. For instance, it could be useful in designing agricultural intercropping systems that reduce spread of plant diseases, and in evaluating and reducing disease risks where agricultural and wildlands come into close contact. For instance, along parts of the Sacramento River in California, walnut farmers successfully lobbied to block riparian restoration efforts because they feared the spread of pests from transplants of native species to their orchards. By examining the evolutionary distance between walnuts and plant species in the restored areas, restoration ecologists could identify those species most likely to share pathogens with the valuable crop, and conduct research or adjust restoration practices accordingly.</p><p>Gilbert's findings can also be used to help evaluate risks of introducing biological control agents, such as the introduction of fungal pathogens to control the devastatingly invasive yellow star thistle.</p><p>Gilbert conducted his research during 2005-06 in Panama, where he examined the impact of 53 fungal pathogens on plants across the range of "phylogenetic distance," or the estimated time of independent evolution between plant species. He first conducted a study in a nursery setting where he used seedlings of 45 species of tropical forest trees grown for reforestation projects, all native to Panama's forests but not a naturally occurring mix of species. The second study took place in three plots in mature rain forest. Pathogens were cultured from specimens gathered from each location, and leaves inoculated in the field. Overall, there were 384 fungus-plant pairs in the nursery and 578 pairs in the forest study.</p><p>"These pathogens are a lot more likely to be hitting a lot more kinds of plants than we thought, because no one went to the trouble to do all the tests," said Gilbert.</p><p>He is expanding his research to evaluate the severity of damage caused by pathogens, from inconsequential to lethal, and he has begun collecting data on soil-borne diseases to conduct a similar evaluation of plant vulnerability to those pathogens.</p><p>#####</p><p>Note to journalists: Gilbert can be reached directly at (831) 459-5002 or via e-mail sent to ggilbert@ucsc.edu.

The 13th annual UCSC Student Employee Recognition Award Program outdoor reception and ceremony is scheduled for Friday, May 11, from 3 to 5 p.m., at the Oakes lower field. Refreshments will be served. Supervisors of outstanding student employee award recipients are invited to attend this upcoming event along with their student employee(s).</p><p>The purpose of the award ceremony is to provide UCSC's top student workers with a cash award that may range from a minimum of $100 to a maximum of $2,000. Students receive a certificate of appreciation signed by the UCSC Chancellor, the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs, and the Career Center Director and an official public recognition of their excellent service to the university. These honored student employees will also receive a written acknowledgment of their excellent service to the university.</p><p>This award gives the opportunity to student employees to note this achievement on their resume and will provide them with a well-earned advantage as they seek future employment. Discretion should be used when selecting student nominees. This award is only for those students who have demonstrated exemplary work performance in accordance with award program criteria. Please review the eligibility criteria prior to making your decision to nominate a student.</p><p>It is important to note that eligible student employees must be in good academic standing. It is best not to inform your student nominee of their nomination until their academic status is confirmed. Upon receipt of the unit's nomination form, the Career Center will verify the student's academic status and inform the supervisor if the student is ineligible to participate. In order to minimize the processing associated with the Certificate of Appreciation, nomination forms should reflect the legal name of each student nominee.</p><p>Divisions/units have the option of participating in the SERAP program. Please confirm with your division/unit if you may nominate student employees.

Whitehead and Charles McDowell, professor of computer science, are leading the effort to increase the amount of computer game programming taught to undergraduates. The $80,000 gift from Microsoft will enable beginning computer science students to start doing computer game programming in an entry-level course, and will establish an optional game-programming project in a general education course.</p><p>"Our concern was that the current projects might not be as interesting to the students as game projects, or that they might not see the relevance," Whitehead said. "The game component might get them excited about computer science and keep them involved."</p><p>Whitehead was instrumental in establishing UCSC's new major in computer game design, one of the few such majors in the country. Since its inception in July 2006, both the major and its course work have been extremely popular with students. According to McDowell, student applications to study computer science at UCSC have risen from around 350 to almost 600 since the creation of the new major.</p><p><i>Foundations of Interactive Game Design,</i> the general education course that will benefit from the Microsoft gift, is popular with students from a wide range of majors--213 students enrolled in the class this quarter. The course already incorporates a project in which students create a simple computer game, but they've been using a computer program that allows them to create a game without having to know any programming. </p><p>"I found there's always 10 to 15 percent of the people in the class who are interested in doing something more programming-heavy," Whitehead said. </p><p>The gift will allow those students to do just that. Several sections of the class will program a game by writing raw code, while others will continue to use the software interface.</p><p>In the beginning computer science class, <i>Introduction to Programming,</i> the instructors will replace an existing quarter-long project with one incorporating computer game programming. Students will create a virtual pet, similar to a Tamagotchi or Animal Crossing character, that will be able to interact with its virtual environment and with other students' virtual pets. </p><p>In both classes, students will be able to choose whether they want to participate in the computer game programming or the more traditional sections of the course. Whitehead said he hopes the more intensive computer game experience will encourage students to stay in computer science or to transfer into the major. Faculty will compare the sections of each course and assess how well the programming projects educated students and encouraged them to remain involved with computer science.</p><p>"The goal of the gift from Microsoft is to help pay for the development and assessment of these projects," Whitehead said. </p><p>The researchers plan to summarize their results in an article and publish them for other computer science educators. The Microsoft gift is evidence of how quickly Santa Cruz's computer game design program has grown, according to Whitehead. </p><p>"It's a really strong endorsement of our program," he said. "In essentially two years, we were able to go from having no presence in this area to having the kind of presence that enabled us to get this gift."</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact James Whitehead at (831) 459-1227 or ejw@cs.ucsc.edu.

Their results provide insight into what may have been the first self-replicating molecule to arise billions of years ago on the evolutionary path toward the emergence of life.</p><p>In all forms of life known today, the synthesis of DNA and RNA molecules is carried out by enzymes made of proteins. The instructions for making those proteins are contained in genes made of DNA or RNA (nucleic acids). The circularity of this process poses a challenge for theories about the origins of life.</p><p>"Which came first, nucleic acids or proteins? This question once seemed an intractable paradox, but with the discovery of ribozymes, it is now possible to imagine a prebiotic 'RNA World' in which self-replicating ribozymes accomplished both tasks," said William Scott, associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz.</p><p>Scott and postdoctoral researcher Michael Robertson determined the structure of a ribozyme that joins two RNA subunits together in the same reaction that is carried out in biological systems by the protein known as RNA polymerase. Their findings are published in the March 16 issue of the journal <i>Science.</i>  </p><p>"An RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ribozyme is the foundation of the entire RNA World hypothesis," Robertson said. "With that, you would have an RNA capable of making copies of itself; mutations or errors in some copies would result in variations that would be acted on by Darwinian natural selection, and the molecules would evolve into bigger and better ribozymes. That's what makes this structure so interesting."</p><p>Robertson and Scott determined the structure of a ribozyme that is not an entirely self-replicating RNA molecule, but it does carry out the fundamental reaction required of such a molecule--a "ligase" reaction creating a bond between two RNA subunits. </p><p>Robertson obtained the ligase ribozyme through a kind of test-tube evolution when he was a graduate student at the University of Texas, Austin, working in the lab of biochemist Andrew Ellington. Starting with a mixture of randomly synthesized RNA molecules and selecting for the desired properties, researchers are able to evolve RNA enzymes from scratch. In the Ellington lab, Robertson evolved the ligase ribozyme (called the L1 ligase) and determined which parts were critical for its function and which parts could be removed to create a "minimal construct."</p><p>At UC Santa Cruz, he began trying to grow crystals of the ribozyme so that he could use x-ray crystallography to determine its structure. Crystallizing RNA molecules is extremely difficult, and Robertson tried dozens of different versions of the ribozyme under different conditions before he succeeded. Using x-ray crystallography--which involves shining a beam of x-rays through the crystals and analyzing the resulting diffraction patterns--Robertson and Scott were then able to determine the three-dimensional structure of the ribozyme.</p><p>The ribozyme has three stems that radiate from a central hub. The active site where ligation occurs is located on one stem, and the structure shows that the molecule folds in such a way that parts of another stem are positioned over the ligation site, forming a pocket where the reaction takes place. A magnesium ion bound to one stem and positioned in the pocket plays an important role in the reaction, Robertson said.</p><p>The structure indicates that this artificially selected ribozyme uses reaction mechanisms that are much like those used by naturally occuring enzymes, Robertson said. </p><p>"The L1 ligase appears to use strategies of transition-state stabilization and acid-base catalysis similar to those that exist for natural ribozymes and protein enzymes," he said.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Robertson at (831) 459-5292 or robertson@chemistry.ucsc.edu and Scott at (831) 459-5367 or wgscott@chemistry.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915114938072704601a012ff47b64814"><name>1098</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz to present New Directions in Contemporary Opera, a symposium of panels and performances-April 3-7</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1174028400000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz to...</display-name><path>/2007/03/1098</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/03/1098</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338264158</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338264158</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Music</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/03/images/opera_symposium.200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/03/images/opera_symposium.200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>opera_symposium.200.jpg</name><file-size>43634</file-size><width>200</width><height>268</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz opera director Brian Staufenbiel and professor of music Nicole Paiement (Photo by Jim Mackenzie)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Music Department will present a week-long opera symposium titled New Directions in Contemporary Opera, April 3-7, on the university campus. </p><p>Conceived and coordinated by music professor/conductor Nicole Paiement and UC Santa Cruz opera director Brian Staufenbiel, the series of panels and performances will bring together scholars, composers, and performers from the professional world, as well as from such institutions as UCLA, UC Irvine, the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, and the University of Washington in Seattle. </p><p>Events will kick off on Tuesday, April 3, with a reprise performance of renowned composer Lou Harrison's opera, Young Caesar, by Ensemble Parallèle, under the baton of Paiement and director Staufenbiel, at 8 p.m. in the UC Santa Cruz Music Center Recital Hall. The final version of the opera had its world premiere last month at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. UC Santa Cruz professor of music Leta Miller will give a pre-concert talk beginning at 7:15 p.m. </p><p>On Wednesday, April 4, Paiement and Staufenbiel will be joined by librettist Robert Gordon, composer/conductor Robert Hughes, and musicologist Leta Miller for a panel discussion titled "Harrison's Young Caesar: Opening the Door to a New Aesthetic," from 6 to 7:30 p.m. at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History. Admission is free. </p><p>Internationally acclaimed tenor John Duykers will also present a vocal masterclass open to the public on Wednesday, April 4, from 2 to 4 p.m. at the UC Santa Cruz Music Center, Room 131. And on Friday, April 6, there will be a roundtable discussion from 2 to 3:30 p.m. at the same venue on "Gender Issues and Politics in Contemporary Opera," with scholars Mitchell Morris from UCLA, Byron Adams from UC Riverside, Judy Tsou from the University of Washington, and UCSC's Nina Treadwell and Leta Miller. Later that evening, the UC Santa Cruz Opera Program will present selected opera scenes with music by Poulenc, Britten, Vinci, Susa, and Puccini, beginning at 7:30 p.m. in the UCSC Music Center Recital Hall. Admission is free. </p><p>Other highlights of the symposium will include a composer's panel discussion on Saturday, April 7, from 2 to 3:30 p.m. moderated by UC Santa Cruz music professor David Cope with Conrad Susa, Paul Dresher, David Evan Jones, and David Conte, titled "Challenges in Composing New Theater Pieces Today"; as well as a presentation by Clifford Cranna from the San Francisco Opera titled "Commissioning New Opera," later that same afternoon from 4 to 5 p.m. Both of these events will take place at the UCSC Music Center, Room 131, and are free to the public. </p><p>The symposium concludes in the evening of April 7 with a gala concert of contemporary arias featuring soprano Sheri Greenawald, mezzo-soprano Wendy Hillhouse, tenor Joseph Meyers, and Adler Fellow Eugene Brancoveanu as baritone. Pianist Keisuke Nakagoshi will accompany the singers in an evening of music by Stravinsky, Bolcom, Susa, Menotti, Weill, Dresher, Conte, Harrison, Adams, and UCSC composer David Evan Jones. </p><p>Paiement--the founder/director of Ensemble Parallèle--said that she hopes the symposium will help people appreciate contemporary opera, understand how diverse the genre has become, and recognize the great possibilities that lie ahead for opera in the future. </p><p>"Working on Harrison's Young Caesar, as well as other contemporary operas in the last five years, I realized that opera is quickly expanding its shape and borrowing from other art forms and cultures," said Paiement. "In many ways, opera has become much more involved in commenting on society, and it continues to be a leading musical art form. So, a symposium to reflect on where opera is going felt essential."</p><p>Tickets are available for the April 3 performance of Young Caesar and the April 7 Closing Gala Concert. All other events are free. All events are open to the general public. For more information, contact the UC Santa Cruz Ticket Office, (831) 459-2159, or visit: www.santacruztickets.com. The symposium is sponsored by the generous support of Porter College at UC Santa Cruz. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915116248072704601a012fffcd5774b"><name>1099</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Hate/Bias Incident on Campus</title><start-date>1174028400000</start-date><display-name>Hate/Bias Incident on Campus...</display-name><path>/2007/03/1099</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/03/1099</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338264535</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338264535</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am saddened to report that on March 12, offensive and racist messages were etched on a bathroom wall at the Baskin School of Engineering.

Rose expert Orin Martin will share his techniques for choosing and growing roses organically at a free workshop on Saturday, March 31, from 10 a.m. to noon at The Garden Company on Mission Street in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Martin will discuss the importance of selecting disease-resistant varieties, providing essential fertility inputs, following an aggressive pruning program, and using organically acceptable sprays such as dormant oil to prevent diseases. He'll have an array of roses and rose books on hand for participants to survey, so bring a notebook to jot down information.</p>
<p>"This is a great time of year to shop for container-grown roses," says Martin. "They'll be 'pushing buds' or in bloom, so you can get a better feel for their shape and color than trying to select them from catalogs."</p>
<p>Martin will also provide tips on the year-round set of tasks involved in maintaining healthy, happy plants, from planting and watering, to pruning, mulching, and more.</p>
<p>Martin, who manages the Alan Chadwick Garden at UC Santa Cruz, has been growing roses in the Santa Cruz area for more than 30 years. He is the author of A Rose Primer: An Organic Approach to Rose Selection and Care, published by the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden and the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems, and available at The Garden Company and local bookshops.</p>
<p>The workshop is cosponsored by The Garden Company, the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems, and the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden.</p>
<p>The Garden Company is located at 2218 Mission Street in Santa Cruz. For more information, call (831) 459-3240, or e-mail jonitann@ucsc.edu.</p>

"It's a joy to come to work every single day."</p><p>"The law, historically, has been the most effective tool for fighting for civil rights," Filer told the students. "The law is always going to be an effective tool for redressing wrongs. That's what separates us from other countries."</p><p>Students peppered Filer with questions about the three-strikes law, jury selection, mandatory sentencing, plea bargaining, professional burnout, and enforcement of immigration laws--"better questions than you ever ask me," Coonerty quipped as he wrapped up the class. </p><p>"I have an obligation to reach back and help somebody else, because none of us do it on our own," said Filer, an active community member and gifted public speaker who regularly visits elementary and high school classrooms to encourage young people to stay in school. "I want to let them know, if I did it, they can do it."</p><p>On Monday evening, Filer accepted the alumni award from Social Sciences Dean Sheldon Kamieniecki.</p><p>"I was born, raised, and educated in Compton," Filer proudly told the audience during his keynote address. "When you're honoring me, you're also honoring the city of Compton. You're honoring my parents, who deserve it, my siblings, my church, my neighborhood friends, my two daughters, and UCSC."</p><p>"College was not an option, because both my parents stressed education," he said. "It was expected." </p><p>Filer recalled experiencing some "culture shock" at UCSC, where he was one of only 140 black students when he enrolled in 1973. But he made lifelong friends and experienced "an academic awakening" at UCSC that helped him develop the discipline he needed to succeed at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law. He passed the Bar exam the first time he took it. </p><p>At the age of 27, Filer argued People v. Taylor before the California State Supreme Court, winning an 8-0 victory that grants the accused the right to appear in court in civilian clothing. Defendants are entitled to the "garb of innocence," said Filer, proudly noting that the case was cited during the trial of O. J. Simpson.</p><p>For Filer, whose talk was entitled "What is Our Legacy?," helping others is the source of life's greatest satisfaction. "You never know who's listening," he said. "I've had at least five attorneys approach the bench to say, 'You're the reason I went to law school and became an attorney."</p><p>Earlier Monday, Filer appeared on KUSP's Talk of the Bay public affairs program.

The lecture, which is free and open to the public, will begin at 7:30 p.m. in the Media Theater on the UCSC campus. </p><p>Quantum mechanics is the most battle-tested theory in all of science. According to Rosenblum, one third of our modern economy depends on products designed with quantum mechanics. Cosmological theories such as string theory and the Big Bang all start with quantum mechanics. But since its inception eight decades ago, quantum mechanics has mysteriously involved observer-created reality. Furthermore, a physical reality in one place can be created by a distant observer without any connecting physical force.</p><p>Describing the archetypal quantum demonstration, Rosenblum will display the boundary where physics encounters the conscious observer. It is the "skeleton in the closet" of physics, he said, and it takes no physics background to see the quantum enigma that still defies resolution.</p><p>Rosenblum and UCSC physics lecturer Fred Kuttner have written a book on this subject, <i>Quantum Enigma: Physics Encounters Consciousness,</i> published by Oxford University Press in 2006 (see earlier <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=906">press release</a>).</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915122aa8072704601a012ffca379c0e"><name>1131</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Lecture at UCSC to address engineering and national priorities on Thursday, April 12</title><summary>Richard Buckius, assistant director for engineering at the National Science Foundation (NSF), will speak at UC Santa Cruz on Thursday, April 12, on the topic of "Engineering and National Priorities."</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Richard Buckius</keywords><description>Richard Buckius, assistant director for engineering at the National Science Foundation (NSF), will speak at UC Santa Cruz on Thursday, April 12, on the topic of "Engineering and National Priorities."</description><start-date>1175065200000</start-date><display-name>Lecture at UCSC to...</display-name><path>/2007/03/1131</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/03/1131</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338267759</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338267759</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/03/images/buckius.100.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/03/images/buckius.100.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>buckius.100.jpg</name><file-size>29531</file-size><width>100</width><height>120</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Richard Buckius</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Richard Buckius, assistant director for engineering at the National Science Foundation (NSF), will speak at UC Santa Cruz on Thursday, April 12, on the topic of "Engineering and National Priorities." Part of the Distinguished Lecture Series sponsored by UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering, his talk will take place at 2 p.m. in the Simularium (Room 180) of the Engineering 2 Building on the UCSC campus. The event is free and open to the public.</p><p>Buckius is a professor of mechanical science and engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and has served in several positions within NSF's Directorate for Engineering since 1987. Through its support of education and fundamental research, NSF plays a major role in addressing national priorities. Engineering's contributions are critical to ensuring the robust competitiveness of the nation, pushing the research frontier, and preparing a technologically enabled workforce. Buckius will discuss trends in the Directorate for Engineering's activities and programs that shine light on the current and future demands on engineering and NSF. </p><p>During his professional career, Buckius has gained an international reputation for leadership in the field of thermal sciences. Much of his research is fundamental in nature, but it has vital implications for the engineering profession and society. His research interests include radiative heat transfer, Monte Carlo methods in scattering media, and scattering from rough interfaces. Buckius is the author of over 100 publications, books, and invited articles and talks. </p><p>For more information about this lecture, call (831) 459-2158 or e-mail drecept@soe.ucsc.edu.

I am hopeful that UCOP and unions representing about 500 UC Santa Cruz custodians and food service workers, and about 100 technical workers, will reach a similar agreement soon.</p><p>Last September, I set aside campus funds to raise the wages of all our lower-paid workers. The agreement reached Thursday means low-wage clerical workers at UCSC will receive wage increases retroactive to October 1, 2006. These increases will raise the minimum annual salary to $25,000 and provide equity increases from 1 to 4 percent--depending on salary level--to individuals making between $25,000 and $35,000 a year.</p><p>Then, beginning April 1, clerical employees who earn less than $40,000 a year will receive additional raises as described in the UCOP and CUE agreement.</p><p>We are very pleased to accomplish this important first step. An announcement of a similar wage increase for an additional 450 lowest paid employees not represented by a union will also be announced shortly. </p><p>Additional information is available from Staff Human Resources or Labor Relations at 459-2980.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>Campus Community</audience><admin>Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915126168072704601a012ffef8155c4"><name>1134</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC lecture series spotlights coastal policy challenges</title><summary>A ten-week lecture series at UC Santa Cruz on "Coastal Policy Challenges of the 21st Century" will be held on Wednesdays at 2 p.m., starting April 4.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>coastal policy, environmental toxicology, Michael Connor</keywords><description>A ten-week lecture series at UC Santa Cruz on "Coastal Policy Challenges of the 21st Century" will be held on Wednesdays at 2 p.m., starting April 4.</description><start-date>1175065200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC lecture series spotlights...</display-name><path>/2007/03/1134</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/03/1134</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338268610</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338268610</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Environmental Toxicology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A ten-week lecture series at UC Santa Cruz on "Coastal Policy Challenges of the 21st Century" will be held on Wednesdays at 2 p.m., starting April 4.

"It took a lot of hard work. Every member of this team wanted to succeed."</p><p>Many schools field teams coached by law-school faculty members, attorneys, and judges, noted DiCicco, who started UCSC's mock-trial club four years ago and first fielded a team with eight members in 2005. </p><p>Mock trial competitions are a popular way for students to explore the work of trial attorneys and learn about the judicial system. Participants spend six months acting out all aspects of a civil or criminal trial based on a fictional case provided each August by the American Mock Trial Association. Team members rehearse the roles of plaintiffs, defense attorneys, and witnesses, and they sort through affidavits, evidence, and exhibits. Team members exchange roles and "play both sides" of the case.</p><p>DiCicco got the mock-trial bug during high school in Santa Barbara. "I'm a very competitive person, and I want to be an attorney," said DiCicco, a senior history major with a minor in legal studies who finished classes in winter quarter. He plans to enroll at UC Hastings School of Law in San Francisco this fall.</p><p>In 2006, DiCicco recruited students in legal studies and politics classes, and a junior varsity team was added. Both teams made it to the Great Western Regional competition in Los Angeles this year, with the varsity team advancing to the nationals in Waukegan, Illinois. Most participants are juniors and sophomores, making their success even more impressive.</p><p>"When I got to UCSC, all the UC campuses had teams except Santa Cruz, Riverside, and Irvine," said DiCicco. "I felt this would benefit the university."</p><p>Politics professor Daniel Wirls signed on as faculty sponsor, but the team gets no coaching and only minimal financial support from the campus. "We're self-coached and self-run, a democratic student organization with elected officers," said DiCicco, noting that students from all disciplines participate. "The only other member of the original team is an engineering major."</p><p>At the regionals, UCSC ranked beneath only the University of Southern California, which fielded four teams, and Arizona State University. DiCicco received an award for outstanding achievement. Although teams argue the same case all season, new information, witnesses, and evidence are introduced at each competition. "You do have to constantly change and adapt," said DiCicco. "It's an amazing intellectual challenge."</p><p>"People do mock trial for a lot of the same reasons they do college sports--to prove their ability, to represent their institution, and to hone their own abilities," he said. "People treat it like a sporting event, tracking individual statistics and placing odds on teams to win."</p><p>Students worked hard for their success, meeting at least every week as a whole group, and more often in subgroups, to analyze large amounts of information "from all different angles," said DiCicco. This year's case involved 14 witnesses and nearly 100 pages of affidavits. After the regionals, the varsity team "kicked it up" and doubled the number of meetings, he said. To raise funds for travel and registration fees, team members asked local businesses for contributions, pitched credit cards, and relied on family contributions.</p><p>Although some team members come from legal families, including Alexandra Pezone, whose father teaches law at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, DiCicco's parents are both artists. "People are always surprised to hear that," he said. Other members of the varsity team were Meghan Herning, Roopa Krishna, Krissia Martinez, Stephen Michael, Nick Ranish, and Lucy Taylor.</p><p>"A lot of campuses have excellent mock trial programs, and now this is one of them," said DiCicco, proudly adding that of two team members who graduated last year, one is in law school at the University of San Diego and the other is working as a paralegal for a prestigious law firm in Washington, D.C.</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915128ff8072704601a012ffd10737ce"><name>1137</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Senior Design Contest features interdisciplinary student projects</title><summary>Undergraduate students in computer engineering and electrical engineering presented their senior design projects before a panel of judges in the Baskin School of Engineering's Senior Design Contest.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>senior design projects, Cyrus Bazeghi</keywords><description>Undergraduate students in computer engineering and electrical engineering presented their senior design projects before a panel of judges in the Baskin School of Engineering's Senior Design Contest.</description><start-date>1175151600000</start-date><display-name>Senior Design Contest features...</display-name><path>/2007/03/1137</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/03/1137</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338269384</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338269384</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/03/images/beedl.200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/03/images/beedl.200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>beedl.200.jpg</name><file-size>48313</file-size><width>200</width><height>133</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The BEEDL team--Karen Liu, Kipling Inscore, Jerome Bougoffa, and Edmond Szeto--won first place in the Senior Design Contest.

Contributions from individual donors provided $1,000 in prize money, which was divided among the top three teams.</p><p>The top prize of $600 went to the Bluetooth Enabled Electronic Doorlock (BEEDL) project. The team of four students--Edmond Szeto, Jerome Bougoffa, Kipling Inscore, and Karen Liu--developed a door lock that can be opened by entering a password on a cell phone. Their presentation included a working prototype and a product brochure complete with an order form. The team's faculty advisers were Cyrus Bazeghi, lecturer in computer engineering, and Wentai Liu, professor of electrical engineering. </p><p>The second-place prize went to Universal Real-time Navigational Assistance (URNA), a pedestrian navigation system for the blind. Third place went to SparcFPGA, an implementation of the OpenSPARC processor design from Sun Microsystems on a type of programmable chip called a field-programmable gate array (FPGA).</p><p>The senior design projects are completed during a two-quarter course sequence (fall-winter or winter-spring). Students work in cross-disciplinary teams to develop a design and create a prototype. Starting last year, the engineering school has organized a contest at the end of each course sequence.</p><p>The judges--all UCSC alumni now working in the high-tech industry--evaluated the student projects on the basis of three criteria: technological innovation and realization; presentation ability; and effective team collaboration. The students presented the results of their work in corporate-style presentations intended to prepare students for real-world work experiences.</p><p>"We give them advice and support, but these projects are all the original designs of the students themselves," Bazeghi said.</p><p>More details about the student projects are available on the <a href="http://wiki.soe.ucsc.edu/bin/view/SoeClasses/CMPE123A%2bBFall2006">class wiki</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91512a648072704601a012ffc5433973"><name>1139</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Wildlife photographer Kennan Ward branches out with feature-length documentary about grizzly cubs</title><summary>Kennan Ward, who earned a B.A. in environmental studies and wildlife biology from UC Santa Cruz in 1980, has spent three decades crisscrossing the globe to photograph animals in the wild.</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>ward, photography, grizzly, environment, bears, kennan, naturalist, filmmaker, tracks, wildlife</keywords><description>Kennan Ward, who earned a B.A. in environmental studies and wildlife biology from UC Santa Cruz in 1980, has spent three decades crisscrossing the globe to photograph animals in the wild.</description><start-date>1175151600000</start-date><display-name>Wildlife photographer Kennan Ward...</display-name><path>/2007/03/1139</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/03/1139</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338269742</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338269742</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/03/images/three_bears.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/03/images/three_bears.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>three_bears.300.jpg</name><file-size>68906</file-size><width>300</width><height>199</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><i>Making Tracks</i> will premiere at 7:30 p.m. on April 20 at the Rio Theatre in Santa Cruz in a benefit for the Conservation Alliance and the UCSC Recreation Department.

His joy quickly turned to disappointment, however, when the magazine sent him to the San Diego Wild Animal Park to shoot captive animals.</p><p>"Even for the biggest magazines, it's just not cost-effective to photograph animals in the wild," said Ward, one of the leading wildlife photographers in the world and a purist who prefers to work in nature. "I like my animals wild. That's what separates us from 99 percent of the nature photography out there."</p><p>Ward, who earned a B.A. in environmental studies and wildlife biology from UC Santa Cruz in 1980, and his wife and fellow photographer, Karen, have spent three decades crisscrossing the globe to photograph animals in the wild. Ward is perhaps best known for his captivating photographs of grizzly bears, although his portfolio includes stunning landscapes and irresistible shots of polar bears, birds, marine mammals, and more. His success has allowed Ward to pursue his art on his own terms: He and Karen spend three to six months each year in the field and have logged hundreds of hours in Alaska, Antarctica, and Africa.</p><p>The author of six books, including books about grizzlies, polar bears, Denali National Park, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Ward is a naturalist as well as a documentarian.</p><p>Ward credits his UCSC mentor, the late Raymond Dasmann, with broadening his understanding of bears by encouraging him to learn about natural history, ecology, and habitat. "That's the best thing I learned at UCSC--natural history," said Ward, producing a copy of his hand-typed senior thesis "Grizzly Bears and Man (A Co-Evolution)." Dasmann, with fellow environmental studies professor Richard Cooley and natural history professor Kenneth Norris, were "the best in the world," said Ward. "It was an incredible opportunity to absorb from those guys, who were at the top of their game."</p><p>With so much experience photographing and observing grizzly bears in Alaska, Ward saw an opportunity six years ago to reach viewers on another level and began filming bears in the wild. Ward's first-ever feature-length documentary film, <i>Making Tracks</i>, tells the story of two Alaskan grizzly bear cubs. </p><p>"Knowing so much about bear biology and behavior, I find still photographs don't show me their full behavior," said Ward. "I love still photography, because you can capture a moment and store it, but motion goes one step beyond. It gives you more emotion."</p><p>Narrated by Ward, the film showcases the photographer's signature themes that run through his books: challenge, competition, and the struggle for survival. Appropriate for children and engaging for adults, the 100-minute film showcases grizzlies like never before. </p><p>"It shows the life of two cubs with their mother for three years," said Ward, who spent six months poring through hundreds of hours of tape with editor Matt Widmann. "This is the real thing. It's natural history."</p><p>Ward has little regard for what he calls a "touchy-feely" approach to documenting animal behavior, in which humans make themselves and their interactions with animals part of the story. "This was going to be a rebuttal to <i>Grizzly Man</i>," said Ward, referring to Werner Herzog's documentary about Timothy Treadwell's years living among grizzlies in Alaska. "But then all of the sudden I realized the cubs had a story of their own, and their story unfolded."</p><p><i>Making Tracks</i> shows the cubs foraging for food, learning to snag salmon, being harassed by coyotes, and it features many other behaviors that enlighten and entertain. </p><p>"The cubs face all kinds of trouble," said Ward. "What I like is that we, as kids and adults, are always in trouble, just like the cubs. But the cubs keep on going. They're a good example for us."</p><p>Ward treasures his time in the remote wilderness, where he keeps his distance from the subjects he is photographing. "Every single moment I'm in nature, I learn something," he said. "It's humbling." </p><p>Few people have the patience and determination to do what the Wards do, however. Karen said a typical day in Alaska begins with coffee at 3 a.m., followed by several hours in the field. By 7:30 a.m., the light is too bright and the photographers retreat for a midday nap, only to rise at 4 p.m. and shoot again until midnight. "You work seven days a week and never sleep eight hours in a row," she said. "You're pretty much on call the whole time. You can spend months waiting, and then something happens for two minutes. If you miss it, you're heartbroken."</p><p>The difference between a good shot and a great shot is timing, she said, adding that many summers they've had "fourth quarter" success. One summer, on the very day the plane was coming to pick them up from their remote location, the caribou migration began, with 180,000 animals moving through in a few hours. "Kennan shot 10 rolls," she recalled. "That made our whole summer."</p><p>Ward grew up in the Midwest, moved to California by himself at the age of 19, and put himself through school working as a park ranger. "I wasn't supposed to go to college, but I was really curious," he said. Awed by the beauty of California, he started taking photographs in earnest to show his family and friends what he'd found. "I couldn't believe it," he recalled. "Photography was my only tool to describe this place."</p><p>Three decades later, UCSC undergraduates in environmental studies and biology regularly intern with the Wards in their Santa Cruz-based business. "As you get older, you have a need to help somebody on their way," he said. "Ray Dasmann did that for me."</p><p>Ward's images are available on note cards, on posters, and in limited edition fine-art prints from <a href="http://kennanward.com">Kennan Ward Photography.</a> "I'm a surviving artist," said Ward. "I'm one of a handful who has the freedom to do this. We have the luxury of time and our own resources."</p><p>Ward's next project draws on the wisdom of his mentor. "Ray always said, 'If you want to know the predator, watch the prey.' So I'm going to do salmon. It involves all my pals--foxes, wolves, otters, eagles, orcas, seals, <i>and</i> bears."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a274af628072704601a012ffe9659deb"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2007/03/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/03/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282625810174</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282625810174</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a274af628072704601a012ffe9659deb"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2007/03/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/03/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282625810174</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282625810174</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
