A book signing will follow his reading. Admission is free and open to the public.</p><p>Jonathan Franzen--winner of the National Book Award in 2001 for his highly acclaimed novel The Corrections--will give a free public reading at a separate event on Thursday, January 11, at 7:30 p.m. in the Humanities Lecture Hall. Franzen's appearance will be the first of a new annual series of readings by distinguished authors presented by UCSC's Writing Program. </p><p>At the Franzen event, the Writing Program will also present the first annual "Published Non-Fiction Writing Award" to a student writer whose work was published in a campus publication during 2005-06. The award will be shared by two UCSC students this year-Laura Mattingly, who writes for Metro Santa Cruz, and Henry Jones, a freelance writer for Good Times. </p><p>"We're especially glad to have Jonathan Franzen initiating our Distinguished Author Series and presenting the award to students," said Elizabeth Abrams, chair of UCSC's Writing Program. "Franzen's work is a wonderful inspiration for student writers. In his New Yorker pieces, he redefines the essay in the seamless mixing of personal narrative and reportage. He'll be presenting a writing award to young journalists who share his seriousness about writing."</p><p>In addition to The Corrections (2001), Franzen is also the author of the novels The Twenty-Seventh City (1988) and Strong Motion (1992), as well as a collection of essays, How to Be Alone (2002) and a memoir, The Discomfort Zone (2006). His many awards include the American Academy's Berlin Prize in 2000 and a Whiting Writers' Award in 1988. Franzen was also named one of "Twenty Writers for the 21st Century" by the New Yorker and one of the "Best Young American Novelists" by Granta. </p><p>Abrams noted that that UCSC's Writing Program is "thrilled to advance the cause of student writing by recognizing the importance of student publications," and added that prior to his reading, Franzen will conduct a one-hour seminar for students on the principles of non-fiction writing. </p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915093308072704601a012ff258f5291"><name>1005</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomers discover an enormous halo of red giant stars around Andromeda</title><summary>Astronomers have found an enormous halo of stars bound to the Andromeda galaxy and extending far beyond the swirling disk seen in images of the famous galaxy, our nearest large galactic neighbor.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Guhathakurta, Andromeda</keywords><description>Astronomers have found an enormous halo of stars bound to the Andromeda galaxy and extending far beyond the swirling disk seen in images of the famous galaxy, our nearest large galactic neighbor.</description><start-date>1168153200000</start-date><display-name>Astronomers discover an enormous...</display-name><path>/2007/01/1005</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/01/1005</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338231035</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338231035</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Astronomers have found an enormous halo of stars bound to the Andromeda galaxy and extending far beyond the swirling disk seen in images of the famous galaxy, our nearest large galactic neighbor. The discovery, reported at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Seattle, suggests that Andromeda is as much as five times larger than astronomers had previously thought. </p><p>"I am absolutely astounded by how big this halo is. As we looked farther and farther out, we kept finding stars that look like halo stars," said Puragra (Raja) Guhathakurta, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who will present the findings at the meeting. </p><p>Guhathakurta and his collaborators at UCSC, UCLA, and the University of Virginia are conducting an ongoing study of Andromeda's stellar halo, using observations at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona and the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Their new findings are based on data gathered using the 4-meter Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak and the DEIMOS spectrograph on the 10-meter Keck II Telescope in Hawaii. </p><p>The researchers detected a sparse population of red giant stars--bright, bloated stars in a late stage of stellar evolution--that appear to be smoothly distributed around the galaxy out to a distance of at least 500,000 light-years from the center. Even at that great distance, the stars are bound to the galaxy by gravity. These stars probably represent Andromeda's stellar halo, a distinct structural component of the galaxy that has eluded astronomers for over 20 years, Guhathakurta said. </p><p>Following up on their discovery of Andromeda's halo, the researchers have found evidence that stars in the halo are chemically anemic compared with stars in the inner parts of the galaxy, said Jasonjot Kalirai, a postdoctoral fellow at UCSC. The halo stars are "metal-poor," meaning they contain smaller amounts of the heavier elements, a finding that is consistent with theoretical models of galaxy formation, Kalirai said.</p><p>Andromeda (also known as M31) is a large spiral galaxy very similar to our own Milky Way. While it is difficult for astronomers to study the overall structure of the Milky Way from Earth's vantage point within it, Andromeda offers a global view of a classic spiral galaxy that is close enough for astronomers to observe individual stars within it. Andromeda is about 2.5 million light-years from Earth and is the largest galaxy in the "Local Group," which also includes the Milky Way and about 30 smaller galaxies.</p><p>"The physical size of this galaxy is really striking," said coauthor R. Michael Rich of UCLA. "The suburbs of M31 and the Milky Way are so extended that they nearly overlap in space, despite the great distance between these two galaxies. If the whole of M31 were bright enough to be visible to the naked eye, it would appear to be huge, larger in apparent size than the Big Dipper."</p><p>Spiral galaxies typically have three main components: a flattened disk, a bright central bulge with a dense concentration of stars, and an extended spherical halo of sparsely distributed stars. The concentration of stars in the central bulge decreases exponentially with increasing distance from the center, whereas the density of the halo stars falls off more gradually (as an inverse power of the radius).</p><p>In Andromeda, the disk has a radius of about 100,000 light-years. Outside the plane of the disk, stars plausibly belonging to the central bulge can be found as far out as 100,000 light-years from the center of the galaxy, while the halo extends five times farther than that, according to Guhathakurta.</p><p>"We now believe that previous groups have been mistakenly identifying the outer parts of the Andromeda bulge as its halo," he said.</p><p>Guhathakurta's group was able to detect the halo by developing a sophisticated technique for clearly distinguishing halo stars in Andromeda from the more numerous foreground stars in the Milky Way. A foreground star with low luminosity and a luminous star that is much farther away can be hard to tell apart because they appear to be equally bright from our perspective, Guhathakurta said. </p><p>"A firefly 10 feet away and a powerful beacon in the distance can have the same apparent brightness. In this case, the fireflies are dwarf stars in our own galaxy and the beacons are red giant stars in Andromeda," he said. </p><p>Karoline Gilbert, a UCSC graduate student, developed the technique for separating the fireflies from the beacons. Her technique provided a clear separation between the two populations of stars by combining five diagnostic criteria based on photometry (brightness measurements) and spectroscopy (which separates starlight into a spectrum of different wavelengths). The diagnostic criteria include radial velocity and parameters based on differences in surface gravity between red giants and dwarf stars.</p><p>"We focused on detecting red giant stars in the halo because they are bright enough for us to obtain spectra," Gilbert said. "There are assuredly other kinds of stars in Andromeda's halo, but they are just too faint for us to get spectra of them."</p><p>In addition to Gilbert, Guhathakurta, Kalirai, and Rich, the other collaborators include Steven Majewski, James Ostheimer, and Richard Patterson at the University of Virginia and David Reitzel at UCLA. </p><p>The group's ongoing investigation of Andromeda's halo promises to shed new light on the question of how large galaxies formed, Guhathakurta said.</p><p>"Galaxy formation theories tell us that halos are pristine--the oldest component of the galaxy--but this is based almost entirely on studies of our own galaxy. A detailed study of this newly discovered Andromeda halo will allow us to test whether these theories apply more generally to galaxies other than the Milky Way," he said. </p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Guhathakurta at (831) 459-5169 or raja@ucolick.org; Kalirai at (831) 459-3804 or jkalirai@ucolick.org; and Gilbert at (831) 459-3259 or kgilbert@ucolick.org.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915094c28072704601a012ff933fd762"><name>1006</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>American Mathematical Society honors Harold Widom, professor emeritus of mathematics</title><summary>Harold Widom, professor emeritus of mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will share the 2007 Norbert Wiener Prize in Applied Mathematics with UC Davis professor of mathematics Craig Tracy.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Widom</keywords><description>Harold Widom, professor emeritus of mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will share the 2007 Norbert Wiener Prize in Applied Mathematics with UC Davis professor of mathematics Craig Tracy.</description><start-date>1168326000000</start-date><display-name>American Mathematical Society honors...</display-name><path>/2007/01/1006</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/01/1006</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338231426</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338231426</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Mathematics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Harold Widom, professor emeritus of mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will share the 2007 Norbert Wiener Prize in Applied Mathematics with UC Davis professor of mathematics Craig Tracy. </p><p>Presented every three years by the American Mathematical Society and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, the Wiener Prize is awarded for outstanding contributions to applied mathematics in the highest and broadest sense.

At a distance of more than a billion light-years, the newly discovered star clusters provide a unique probe of what similar systems in our own galaxy once looked like.</p><p>"Given their distance, the light that we see today from these clusters was emitted more than one billion years ago and may hold important clues for understanding the evolution of globular clusters," said Jason Kalirai, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who will present the findings in a talk at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Seattle. </p><p>Kalirai and Harvey Richer of the University of British Columbia led the study, which began as an investigation of a globular star cluster in the Milky Way galaxy known as NGC 6397. The researchers acquired one of the deepest optical images ever taken with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys, focusing on a small field within NGC 6397. This cluster, home to hundreds of thousands of stars, is 8,500 light-years away, making it one of the closest globular clusters to Earth.</p><p>The new data from stars within NGC 6397 have yielded important insights into the age, origin, and evolution of this cluster. Hidden in the background, however, were findings that may hold even greater promise for understanding the evolution of such clusters, Kalirai said. Within the population of stars and galaxies behind NGC 6397, the Hubble image revealed a large elliptical galaxy that contains several hundred globular clusters.</p><p>Although each of these clusters probably contains hundreds of thousands of stars, they are so far away from the Earth that each cluster appears as a single faint point of light in the Hubble image. In fact, a single giant star in NGC 6397 appears 10 million times brighter than one of the distant globular clusters. Nevertheless, the faint light from these clusters could yield valuable information, Kalirai said.</p><p>Kalirai and Richer followed up the Hubble imaging observations with spectroscopic observations using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph on the Gemini South Telescope on Cerro Pachon in Chile. They were able to determine the distance of the elliptical galaxy hosting the globular clusters by measuring its redshift (a measure of how the expansion of the universe shifts the wavelengths of light from a distant object). This showed that the globular clusters are the most distant ever studied. </p><p>"The properties that we infer for these clusters may therefore represent an important clue in understanding what our own Milky Way globulars, such as NGC 6397, looked like in the past," Kalirai said.</p><p>Previous studies by other researchers of globular clusters in nearby galaxies, including the Milky Way, have shown that these systems play a very important role in understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies. With a sample of almost 200 clusters in this one distant galaxy, Kalirai's team will test whether the properties of these globulars are consistent with the idea that elliptical galaxies formed the bulk of their stars at early times. For the first time, the observations may also allow astronomers to test for evolution in the properties of globular clusters themselves, Kalirai said. </p><p>In addition to Kalirai and Richer, the team involved in this research includes Jay Anderson of Rice University and Jay Strader and Kieran Forde of UC Santa Cruz. This work was supported by NASA through a Hubble Fellowship grant awarded by the Space Telescope Science Institute to Kalirai. Support for this work was also provided by a grant from NASA/STScI, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and the Canada-U.S. Fulbright Program through the award of a Fulbright Fellowship to Richer.</p><p>_____</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Kalirai at (831) 459-3804 or jkalirai@ucolick.org and Richer at (604) 822-4134 or richer@astro.ubc.ca.</p><p>An image of NGC 6397 can be obtained after the embargo expires at <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/~jkalirai/globulars.jpg">http://www.ucolick.org/~jkalirai/globulars.jpg</a></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915097e58072704601a012ff8df882b9"><name>1008</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Important changes in the monthly payroll earning statement distribution</title><start-date>1168326000000</start-date><display-name>Important changes in the...</display-name><path>/2007/01/1008</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/01/1008</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338232229</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338232229</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Payroll Office is pleased to announce that the monthly Statement of Earnings for those employees receiving their payroll through direct deposit will be available online from the secure and confidential UC At Your Service online web site (AYSO).

<p>In an effort to improve data security by reducing the amount of handling of Statement of Earnings and to conserve resources, after the August 2007 pay dates, current and new employees will no longer receive a paper version of the monthly statement. Between the January 2007 and August 2007 payroll payment dates, a paper-version of the Statement of Earnings will continue to be sent to you in the usual way. During this period of time, you can compare the paper-version to the identical online version of your</p>
<p>Statement of Earnings.</p>
<p>The AYSO web site can be accessed from any computer that has an internet connection, including from your home computer. If you do not have access to a computer or are otherwise unable to obtain your earnings statement online you will need to request that paper-versions of your monthly Statement of Earnings be provided by completing the Earnings Statement Online Disposition Exception Form, which is available from the Payroll Office web site or from the Payroll Office. The same form may also be used to revoke a</p>
<p>prior request for paper-versions of the monthly Statement of Earnings.</p>
<p>ACCESS YOUR W-2 ON THE WEB</p>
<p>Like last year, UC employees will be able to access tax year 2006 duplicate W-2 forms online from the UC At Your Service On-line (AYSO) employee self-service web site (<a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/">http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/</a>). Tax year 2005 duplicate W-2 forms also remain available for download from the AYSO.</p>
<p>Starting next year, for tax year 2007 W-2 forms, UC will be implementing an exciting new feature on the AYSO. You will have the option of receiving an electronic W-2 form instead of a waiting for delivery by mail of a paper tax year 2007 W-2 form. Get it faster, save a tree, and feel more secure about the protection of your personal tax information. Follow these steps to sign up to receive your tax year 2007 W-2 form electronically next year:</p>

<p>Step 6: If you decided to sign up, you will receive a confirmation e-mail from UC Customer Service sent to the notification e-mail address selected in step 5.</p>
<p>Making available electronic W-2 forms is part of a University-wide effort to improve customer service by eliminating the wait associated with receiving paper W-2 forms through the mail, reduce the consumption of natural resources that are used to print and distribute W-2 forms, and improve security over personal, confidential data by reducing the number of individuals handling W-2 forms.</p>
<p>If you have problems viewing your W-2 form and would like to be sent a duplicate paper W-2 form, please obtain a Request for Duplicate W-2 Form from the Payroll Office web site, complete it, and send it to the Payroll Office. For security reasons, a duplicate W-2 form cannot be faxed to you, so you will need to provide a mailing address. Please allow two to three days</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Academic and Staff Employees</audience><admin>Payroll Office</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915099e48072704601a012ffb0885a0a"><name>1009</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>EEO/Affirmative Action, Title IX/Sexual Harassment Office, and Office of the Ombudsman</title><start-date>1168326000000</start-date><display-name>EEO/Affirmative Action, Title IX/Sexual...</display-name><path>/2007/01/1009</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/01/1009</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338232738</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338232738</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We are delighted to announce that the offices of Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action, Title IX/Sexual Harassment, and the Ombudsman will again report directly to the Chancellor's Office.

He was 82. </p><p>Osterbrock, a professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, was on campus at the time of his death. He had continued to work at UC Santa Cruz and mentor students after his official retirement in 1992.</p><p>"Don Osterbrock was one of the world's most important and influential astronomers during the latter half of the 20th century," said George Blumenthal, acting chancellor of UC Santa Cruz and one of Osterbrock's colleagues in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. "His pathbreaking research covered an impressive range of subjects. He was also an amazing teacher, and his former graduate students comprise a significant part of the leadership of American astronomy today. I had enormous admiration for him--we will all miss his wisdom and humanity."</p><p>Born and raised in Cincinnati, Osterbrock earned a B.S. in physics and M.S. and Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of Chicago. After a posdoctoral fellowship at Princeton University and faculty positions at the California Institute of Technology and the University of Wisconsin, Madison, he came to UC Santa Cruz in 1972 and served as director of UC's Lick Observatory from 1973 to 1981. Founded in 1888, Lick Observatory is situated on Mt. Hamilton near San Jose, with headquarters on the UCSC campus. </p><p>"Don was a gifted leader of UC's Lick Observatory, leading during the crucial period when the 10-meter Keck Telescopes had their beginning. Two competing designs were proposed for these giant telescopes, and Don very effectively and diplomatically guided the University through the difficult choices that had to be made in order to get this project under way," said Joseph Miller, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC who did his graduate work under Osterbrock's supervision and served as director of UC Observatories/Lick Observatory from 1991 to 2005.</p><p>As a researcher, Osterbrock made major contributions in several areas, from understanding the nature of ionized gas around hot stars to discovering and studying new types of active galactic nuclei, which are powered by black holes in the centers of galaxies. He was a pioneer in the use of spectroscopic methods for the study of gaseous nebulae in the cosmos. Osterbrock's books on gaseous nebulae and active galaxies have been standard references for astrophysicists for more than 30 years. He produced a completely revised edition of <i>Astrophysics of Gaseous Nebulae and Active Galactic Nuclei</i> in 2005. </p><p>Osterbrock also published numerous articles and books on the history of astronomy, mostly after his retirement. His fifth book on the history of American astronomy, <i>Walter Baade: A Life in Astrophysics,</i> was published in 2001.  </p><p>Osterbrock received numerous awards and honors, including lifetime achievement awards from the American Astronomical Society and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, two of astronomy's highest honors. In 1997, the Royal Astronomical Society awarded him its highest honor, the Gold Medal, seldom given to an American. The American Astronomical Society and the Antique Telescope Society both honored Osterbrock for his contributions to the history of astronomy. An asteroid was named after him in 1996. </p><p>Osterbrock was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society, and a foreign associate of the Royal Astronomical Society. He served as president of the American Astronomical Society and was a member or chair of various advisory committees of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Science Foundation, and other agencies and organizations. He was the author, coauthor, or editor of 12 books and published more than 150 research papers. </p><p>He received honorary degrees from Ohio State University, University of Chicago, University of Wisconsin, Ohio University, and University of Cincinnati, as well as the University of Chicago's Alumni Medal and Alumni Association Professional Achievement Award.</p><p>Osterbrock's survivors include his wife, Irene; three children, William Osterbrock and Carol LePage, both of Santa Cruz, and Laura Osterbrock of Seattle; and three grandchildren. Details regarding a memorial service are not yet available.</p><p>----</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/06-07/art/osterbrock.donald.jpg.zip">Click to download photo</a></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91509eda8072704601a012ff4f9d6962"><name>1014</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Renowned astronomer dies yesterday</title><start-date>1168585200000</start-date><display-name>Renowned astronomer dies yesterday...</display-name><path>/2007/01/1014</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/01/1014</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338234001</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338234001</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>It is with great sadness that I write to inform you that one of our most distinguished faculty members, Donald Osterbrock, died suddenly on Thursday.

The awards from DOE's 2007 Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (INCITE) program will support research on supernovae (the explosions of massive stars) and the formation and evolution of the dark matter halo that envelopes the Milky Way galaxy.</p><p>Piero Madau, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, leads the dark matter project. Stan Woosley, also a professor of astronomy and astrophysics, is principal investigator on the supernova research project. </p><p>Madau's group recently completed the largest simulation of the Milky Way's dark matter halo to date, using NASA's Columbia supercomputer (see <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=977">earlier press release</a>). The INCITE award will allow the researchers to run an even larger simulation revealing much more detail of the galaxy-forming region of the halo, Madau said. </p><p>"The simulation will start at about 50 million years after the Big Bang and calculate the interactions of 1 billion particles of dark matter over 13.7 billion years of cosmological time to produce a halo on the same scale as the Milky Way's. It seeks to increase our understanding of the nature of the dark matter that accounts for more than 80 percent of the matter in the universe," he said.</p><p>Madau's coinvestigators on the project are Jürg Diemand and Marcel Zemp, both postdoctoral fellows at UCSC, and Michael Kuhlen at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.</p><p>The INCITE award gives Madau's group 1.5 million processor hours on the Cray XT3 supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which is ranked as the tenth fastest computer in the world. Processor hours refer to how time is allocated on a supercomputer. A project receiving 1 million hours could run on 2,000 processors for 500 hours, or about 21 days. Running a one-million-hour project on a single-processor desktop computer would take more than 114 years. </p><p>Woosley's group received 4 million processor hours on the Oak Ridge Cray XT3. The researchers will use the supercomputer to study key stages in the explosion of type Ia supernovae. Type Ia supernovae are the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars, triggered when the star siphons off enough mass from a companion star to reach a critical mass of about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun. These supernovae are used for cosmic distance measurements because their brightness evolves over time in a predictable manner.</p><p>"By acting as standard candles, type Ia supernovae have been at the forefront of a revolution in modern cosmology, leading to the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. We anticipate that the supercomputer calculations will produce the most detailed picture of type Ia supernovae to date," Woosley said.</p><p>His coinvestigators include Ann Almgren, John Bell, and Marc Day of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; L. Jonathan Dursi of the University of Toronto; Dan Kasen of Johns Hopkins University; Fritz Röpke of UC Santa Cruz; and Michael Zingale of the State University of New York, Stony Brook. </p><p>Supercomputers are playing an increasingly important role in scientific research by allowing scientists to create more accurate models of complex processes, simulate problems once thought to be impossible, and analyze the increasing amount of data generated by experiments. </p><p>Launched in 2003, the INCITE awards support computationally intensive, large-scale research projects and award them large amounts of dedicated time on DOE supercomputers. The 45 projects supported by the program in 2007 include applications ranging from studying global climate change to improving commercial aircraft design. They were chosen in a competitive process based on the potential impact of the science and engineering research and the suitability of the project for use of supercomputers. </p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Madau at (831) 459-3839 or pmadau@ucolick.org and Woosley at (831) 459-2976 or woosley@ucolick.org.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9150a34e8072704601a012ffb07cc52e"><name>1018</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz honored during Ecological Farming Conference Jan. 24-27</title><summary>SANTA CRUZ, CA--The contributions of UC Santa Cruz to sustainable agriculture will be in the spotlight during this year's Ecological Farming Conference, with a focus on the 40th anniversary of the campus's pathbreaking Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticu</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Farm, apprenticeship, agroecology, sustainability, CASFS, eco-farm, ecology, environment, honor</keywords><description>SANTA CRUZ, CA--The contributions of UC Santa Cruz to sustainable agriculture will be in the spotlight during this year's Ecological Farming Conference, with a focus on the 40th anniversary of the campus's pathbreaking Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticu</description><start-date>1168930800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz honored...</display-name><path>/2007/01/1018</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/01/1018</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338235164</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338235164</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>SANTA CRUZ, CA--The contributions of UC Santa Cruz to sustainable agriculture will be in the spotlight during this year's Ecological Farming Conference, with a focus on the 40th anniversary of the campus's pathbreaking Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture.</p>

Y. Wei, dean of the College of Engineering at San Jose State University, for their professional accomplishments and leadership qualities. The honorees will each receive an unrestricted grant of $10,000. </p><p>The award honors the legacy of Chang-Lin Tien, the first Asian American to head a major American research university, and was created to inspire more Asian Americans to aspire to this level of leadership. The program will support the professional development and advancement of Asian American leaders in higher education, an essential resource for our country's global competitiveness. Tien served as chancellor of UC Berkeley from 1990 to 1997. During his tenure, he strengthened undergraduate education, fostered diversity on the Berkeley campus, and raised nearly $1 billion for UC Berkeley. Acclaimed as a teacher, scientist, administrator, and fundraiser, Tien was admired by many students and faculty members. </p><p>"With this award, we want to not only honor these scholars and administrators, but to inform the Asian American community of a vision and career path they might not have considered," said Emerald Yeh, Asian Pacific board member. "We are looking for future 'Dr. Tiens.'"</p><p>Kang was appointed dean of UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering in 2001. During his tenure, he has significantly increased the national visibility of the school and secured resources that doubled the faculty size and quadrupled sponsored research funding. </p><p>"All universities are preparing young people for careers, but it is crucial that our education prepare them for the real world, the global economy, a world which is becoming flat," Kang said. "Diversity in leadership is enormously important and essential to higher education; we would not be as effective otherwise."</p><p>Before coming to UCSC, Kang was head of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and a foreign member of the National Academy of Engineering of Korea. He has served as president of the Silicon Valley Engineering Council and president of the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society, and he was the founding editor-in-chief of the <i>IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Systems.</i> </p><p>Kang has received numerous honors, including the Mac Van Valkenburg Award of the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society, the UC Berkeley Outstanding Alumnus Award in Electrical Engineering, the IEEE Third Millennium Medal, and the SRC Technical Excellence Award. He received a B.S. from Fairleigh Dickinson University, an M.S. from the State University of New York at Buffalo, and a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley. </p><p>The Asian Pacific Fund is a community foundation established in 1993 to improve the well-being of all Asians in the Bay Area. The fund encourages Asian Americans to be involved in the community and to give back. The fund connects donors to pressing community needs and also works with more than 80 local organizations that provide vital services to the diverse Asian American community. Since 1993, the Asian Pacific Fund has distributed nearly $3 million in grants and awards. Chang-Lin Tien was a founding member of its Board of Directors.

Musgrave, widely regarded as the founder of modern public finance and an adviser on fiscal policy and taxation to governments from Washington to Bogota to Tokyo, died Monday, Jan. 15.</p><p>Musgrave, 96, was an adjunct professor of economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and professor emeritus of economics at Harvard University. His wife, Peggy Boswell Musgrave, said Musgrave died of natural causes. </p><p>A staunch believer that government can play a positive and constructive role in society, Musgrave also believed deeply that economists can contribute to making government work well, thereby contributing to a better society. His work on public finance has been described as his "attempt to marry the theory and practice of good government." 	</p><p>"Richard Musgrave transformed economics in the 1950s and 1960s from a descriptive and institutional subject to one that used the tools of microeconomics and Keynesian macroeconomics to understand the effects of taxes," says Martin Feldstein, George F. Baker Professor of Economics at Harvard and president of the National Bureau of Economic Research.</p><p>"Richard Musgrave was a giant - a towering figure who transformed the field of public economics," adds David M. Cutler, Otto Eckstein Professor of Applied Economics and dean for the social sciences in Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences. </p><p>An academic economist for the last 60 years, Musgrave mixed his university work with a wide range of public service and consultation. Starting in the 1940s, he advised governments in Colombia, Chile, Myanmar, Japan, Puerto Rico, South Korea, and Taiwan on taxation and fiscal policy, and led tax reform commissions in Colombia and Bolivia.</p><p>Similarly, domestic agencies and congressional committees repeatedly sought Musgrave's advice on public finance policy questions. He worked with or as a consultant to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury, the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the World Bank.</p><p>Musgrave described the setting of tax policy as a delicate orchestration of factors including employment, inflation, economic growth, and the fair distribution of the tax burden - with the latter generally assigned outsize importance, in Musgrave's view.</p><p>"Clearly, tax policy is not simply a matter of raising revenue in an equitable fashion," he and his wife, then an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in the Boston Globe in 1978. "The entire performance of the economy must be allowed for as well, though this should be done with least damage to the fairness of the tax system."</p><p>Two of Musgrave's books became classics in their field: <i>The Theory of Public Finance: A Study in Public Economy</i> (1958) and <i>Public Finance in Theory and Practice,</i> coauthored with Peggy Musgrave (1973).</p><p>"Intelligent conduct of government is at the heart of democracy," Musgrave wrote in the introduction to The Theory of Public Finance. "It requires an understanding of the economic relations involved; and the economist, by aiding in this understanding, may hope to contribute to a better society. This is why the field of public finance has seemed of particular interest to me; and this is why my interest in the field has been motivated by a search for the good society, no less than by scientific curiosity."	</p><p><i>The Theory of Public Finance</i> transformed the study of public finance to a discipline in which questions are analyzed in general equilibrium terms, where changes in tax policy take into account the resulting changes in the economy. Musgrave's many intellectual contributions included studies on tax incidence, tax progressivity, public goods, fiscal federalism, the effects of taxation on risk taking, and the role of fiscal policy in stabilizing the economy.</p><p>Musgrave's influence endured throughout his lengthy career. In 1998, he was invited by the University of Munich to join his "archrival" in the study of political economy, James M. Buchanan, in a five-day debate. The results were published in 1999 as <i>Public Finance and Public Choice: Two Contrasting Visions of the State.</i> </p><p>"Two towering pillars of 20th-century public economics examine the deep foundations of their own thought and their common subject," economist Robert M. Solow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology wrote of the work. "Who could resist the chance to eavesdrop on their reflections? Certainly not anyone who cares about the role of government in modern society."</p><p>Born Dec. 14, 1910, in Koenigstein, Germany, Richard Abel Musgrave studied at the University of Munich, Exeter College, and the University of Heidelberg, where he received his Diplom Volkswirt (the equivalent of a bachelor's degree) in 1933. He continued his studies at the University of Rochester and at Harvard, where he received an A.M. degree in 1936 and a Ph.D. in 1937.</p><p>Musgrave was an instructor in economics at Harvard until 1941, when he became an economist at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, a position he held until 1947. He taught economics at Swarthmore College from 1947 to 1948, following which he was an economics professor at the University of Michigan from 1948 to 1958; at Johns Hopkins University from 1958 to 1961; and at Princeton University from 1962 to 1965.</p><p>In 1965 Musgrave joined Harvard as professor of economics in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and at Harvard Law School. He was named H. H. Burbank Professor of Economics in 1969, when he also became chair of Harvard's standing committee on Afro-American studies. In 1981 he was named professor emeritus at Harvard and became an adjunct professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, remaining affiliated with that campus through 2004.</p><p>Among his numerous awards and honors, Musgrave was a Fulbright professor in Germany in 1956 and held a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1959. He was named honorary president of the International Institute of Public Finance in 1978, the same year he was elected a Distinguished Fellow of the American Economics Association. He received the Frank E. Seidman Distinguished Award in Political Economy in 1981. In 1983, 50 years to the day after he received his Diplom Volkswirt, Musgrave was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Heidelberg, his alma mater. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1986, and in 1994, he received the Daniel M. Holland Medal from the National Tax Association.</p><p>Musgrave is survived by his wife, Peggy Boswell Musgrave, and three stepchildren: Pamela Clyne of New Jersey, Roger Richmond of California, and Thomas Richmond of Colorado. He is also survived by numerous nephews and nieces, including Harry Krause, the Max L. Rowe Professor Emeritus at the University of Illinois College of Law.

Longtime Santa Cruz resident and library supporter William Ackerknecht has also pledged $100,000 to create an outdoor reading garden that will be located just outside the café. </p><p>The new Global Village Café at UC Santa Cruz will be modeled after the Free Speech Movement Café that was built at UC Berkeley's Moffitt Undergraduate Library, thanks to a 1998 gift Silberstein gave to that campus in honor of Free Speech Movement leader Mario Savio. Plans for the UC Santa Cruz café include a rotating digital newspaper display that spotlights up-to-date front pages of approximately 140 newspapers from around the world. Representing the varied geographic areas of Asia, Europe, South America, Africa, the Middle East, and the United States, the newspaper exhibit is designed to contrast different global perspectives of current events.</p><p>Following the global village theme, the tables in the café will be enhanced with educational images illustrating such concepts as "the politics of food" and current developments in agricultural ecology. Emphasizing environmental responsibility and agricultural sustainability, the café menu will feature fresh, healthy ingredients that are obtained and prepared locally, avoiding prepackaged and junk food. The café is scheduled to open in late 2008.</p><p>The gift to support the Global Village Café complements Ackerknecht's $100,000 donation to create the Mary Ackerknecht Reading Garden Fund in honor of his late wife--a member of the Friends of the UC Santa Cruz Library--who passed away in June 2005. The couple had previously set up an endowment five years earlier in support of contemporary fiction and recreational reading for students at UCSC.  </p><p>The new outdoor reading garden will feature a large terraced grass area, surrounded by benches, tables, and chairs situated under the redwoods-complete with power outlets and wi-fi availability-and landscaped with small cherry trees. The design will ensure that the area receives sunlight, even in the winter. </p><p>"This is a unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make a major contribution to the future of the library and the university," noted Ackerknecht, a resident of Santa Cruz since 1979. "My family and I wanted to establish a significant memorial to Mary, who had a passion for reading which she instilled in our children, and in me as well. So it's very rewarding for me to be able to participate in this."</p><p>An electrical engineer, Ackerknecht worked at Lockheed's research lab in Palo Alto for 10 years, as well as in business development and strategic planning at the company's Sunnyvale office. He also spent time in Idaho Falls as a lab director and worked in Las Vegas at the Nevada Test Site as assistant general manager of business units. Ackerknecht retired in 2002. </p><p>"The cyber café, combined with reading room, will be a place for faculty and students to study, read, and socialize," said Ackerknecht. "The café and the reading garden complement each other; they're very synergistic," he added. "The new remodeled library will be the center of campus where students come to gather-it's a beautiful environment for everyone to enjoy."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9150ae5f8072704601a012ff9a76bf55"><name>1031</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz film scholar B.

Ruby Rich will chair a panel discussion at the Sundance Film Festival about how the counterculture has changed since the 1960s.</p><p>Rich, an assistant professor of community studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a member of the festival's national advisory board, will chair the panel titled "The Times, Did They A-Change?" on Saturday, Jan. 20, in Park City, Utah. </p><p>The panel is linked to a number of festival films that bring up issues relating to American counterculture, including <i>Chicago 10</i> by filmmaker Brett Morgen, a new documentary about the trial of activists following the 1968 Democratic National Convention.</p><p>"Sundance gets media attention for all the hype generated by publicists, but the real heart of the festival has always been panels like this one that take the issues seriously," said Rich, who will be attending her 20th Sundance Festival. "Sundance was the first festival to put documentaries up on the same level as dramatic films, but this is the first time that I can remember that a documentary was chosen for opening night."</p><p>In addition to filmmakers Morgen and Julien Temple, others on the panel will be political and cultural commentator Todd Gitlin, investigative satirist Paul Krassner, activist Mike Bonanno of <i>The Yes Men,</i> and film scholar Patricia Zimmermann.</p><p>"We have enough distance on the sixties, finally, to see some of its events more clearly," said Rich. "At the same time, this panel will be addressing the differences between then and now, and considering what methods--and technologies--are being employed most effectively by new generations of political activists."</p><p>While some might argue that the ideological underpinnings of the 1960s-era counterculture have been eroded, others assert that the ideology is routinely absorbed by the machinery of mass media. Panelists will explore how ideas of counterculture relate to politics, activism, and  protest, as well as race, culture, music, and film.</p><p>#####</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9150b00a8072704601a012ff44741afc"><name>1032</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz assistant arts dean reports discovery of ancient ruin in Peru</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1169190000000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz assistant...</display-name><path>/2007/01/1032</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/01/1032</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338238417</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338238417</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/01/images/muscutt_keith.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/01/images/muscutt_keith.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>muscutt_keith.300.jpg</name><file-size>89963</file-size><width>300</width><height>354</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Keith Muscutt at the site of a newly discovered ruin in a remote area of Peru</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz assistant dean of the arts Keith Muscutt reported the existence of a previously unknown pre-Columbian ruin in Peru at the annual Institute of Andean Studies conference held at UC Berkeley last week.</p><p>Located in the remote and densely forested eastern slope of the Andes Mountains, the massive ruin is thought to be a remnant from Peru's vanished Chachapoya people, who flourished in the upper Amazon region from the ninth to the 15th century. There is little evidence of the culture left today, except for the ruins of ancient settlements and well-preserved mummies recovered from cliff tombs.</p><p>The ruin was first discovered by three local Peruvians in August who relayed the information to Muscutt, an expert on the Chachapoya and author of the 1998 book <i>Warriors of the Clouds: A Lost Civilization in the Upper Amazon of Peru</i> (UNM Press). Muscutt traveled to Peru in late August to make a preliminary survey of the site, dubbed "Huaca La Penitenciaria" (The Penitentiary) because of its formidable appearance. </p><p>The site consists of a large ceremonial platform overlooking a plaza and numerous rectangular and circular buildings, situated in an area that has been covered by forest for centuries. Muscutt noted that it is of particular interest because of its size, distinct design, and remote location.</p><p>"This is an exciting development for Chachapoya archaeology," said Muscutt. "With the exception of the colossal retaining wall of the Chachapoya citadel, Kuelap, I can't think of a Chachapoya engineering project as ambitious as La Penitenciaria. Over 25,000 cubic yards of dressed stone and rubble were needed to build it....It promises to open a new chapter in the history of the Chachapoya." </p><p>Muscutt said that he is currently working with GRB-TV and the Discovery Channel to plan a full-scale archaeological investigation of the newly discovered site. He added that the ruin will be featured in a Discovery Channel documentary series to be aired next year. </p><p>Muscutt has been exploring the Chachapoya's ancient home in the remote upper Amazon region of Peru for the past three decades. In 2001, he was featured in a History Channel program titled <i>Cliff Mummies of the Andes.</i>

Pullum will deliver the 40th annual Faculty Research Lecture on Tuesday, February 13, at 8 p.m. in the Music Center Recital Hall. His lecture is titled "Who Pays Any Attention to the Syntax of Things." The event is free and open to the public.</p><p>Pullum was selected by UCSC faculty members for the prestigious honor in recognition of his "extraordinary research profile," and "dazzling ability to teach and entertain at the same time."</p><p>Elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003, Pullum has published a dozen books and nearly 200 articles on the scientific study of language. He is coauthor of The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language (2002), the first definitive grammar reference book of standard international English in more than 20 years. The 1842-page book received the Leonard Bloomfield Award in 2003--an honor given every other year by the Linguistic Society of America to the single most important contribution in that period to the discipline of linguistics. </p><p>Renowned for his sharp wit, as well as his brilliant scholarship, Pullum is also the author of The Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax, a highly entertaining collection of satirical essays about the field of linguistics. His most recent book, Far from the Madding Gerund, features an irreverent mix of posts culled from the popular blog Language Log, begun in 2003 by Pullum with Mark Liberman of the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Pullum said he was deeply honored to have been chosen as the speaker for the 40th annual Faculty Research Lecture. "To learn that I was selected for an honor like this by my fellow professors here, people who have known me for a quarter of a century, this was truly a wonderful thing."</p><p>"UCSC has a huge and well-deserved reputation for the excellence of its faculty research," Pullum added. "To be picked by these colleagues for an honor that involves lecturing the campus at large is humbling and amazing.and also quite delightful, since there are few things I enjoy more than lecturing on the subject to which my teaching and research is devoted."</p><p>Pullum said his upcoming lecture will provide a glimpse of what those who study English grammar in modern times actually do. He said he would first address "a strange phenomenon" that afflicts the profession of linguistics: the tendency of educated speakers of American English to believe a multitude of things about the grammar of their language that are simply not true, and have never been true. He noted that when linguists attempt to state correctly what is grammatical in Standard English and what is not, they are often met with irritation, disbelief, and the accusation that they are trying to lower standards.</p><p>"There are scientific techniques for establishing conclusions about what is grammatical and what is not, and I plan to exhibit some of these, and show some of the surprising results and complexities that lurk in the language we all share," he said.</p><p>In 2004, Pullum was appointed as Distinguished Professor of Humanities at UCSC. He spent the last year as a Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, where he worked to complete his forthcoming book, Model-Theoretic Syntax. Pullum graduated with high honors from the University of York in 1972, and completed his Ph.D. in linguistics at the University of London in 1976. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9150bc468072704601a012ff933dbd57"><name>1042</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New book explores the effects of whales and whaling on ocean ecosystems</title><summary>&lt;i&gt;Whales, Whaling, and Ocean Ecosystems,&lt;/i&gt; a new book from the University of California Press (December 2006), explores an aspect of whale ecology that until now has received surprisingly little attention--the role of whales in ocean ecosystems.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Estes, whaling, whales</keywords><description>&lt;i&gt;Whales, Whaling, and Ocean Ecosystems,&lt;/i&gt; a new book from the University of California Press (December 2006), explores an aspect of whale ecology that until now has received surprisingly little attention--the role of whales in ocean ecosystems.</description><start-date>1170054000000</start-date><display-name>New book explores the...</display-name><path>/2007/01/1042</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/01/1042</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338241521</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1459455650277</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/01/images/estes_cover.72.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/01/images/estes_cover.72.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>estes_cover.72.jpg</name><file-size>51273</file-size><width>200</width><height>259</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>Whales, Whaling, and Ocean Ecosystems,</em> a new book from the University of California Press (December 2006), explores an aspect of whale ecology that until now has received surprisingly little attention. Focusing on the role of whales in ocean ecosystems, the book looks at the effects of industrial whaling in terms of its ecological impact on the world's oceans.</p>
<p>"We've thought a lot about the impact of whaling on whale populations, but not about its impact on ocean ecosystems and the functional role of whales in the oceans," said James Estes, an adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, who edited the book along with several colleagues.</p>
<p>Approaching these issues from a broad range of perspectives, the book provides a sweeping overview of the natural history, biology, and ecology of whales in the context of their influence on ocean ecosystems and the ecological consequences of a whaling industry that removed large numbers of whales from the oceans.</p>
<p>The book resulted from a workshop on whaling and whale ecology organized by Estes and his coeditors and held in Santa Cruz in 2003. Joining Estes in organizing the workshop and editing the book were Daniel Doak and Terrie Williams, both professors of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC; Douglas DeMaster, director of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center; and Robert Brownell, senior scientist with the Southwest Fisheries Science Center. The workshop was supported by funds Estes received as a Pew Marine Conservation Fellow.</p>
<p>Whales are the largest animals on the planet, and they are such impressive creatures that our interest in them has tended to focus on the whales themselves rather than on the roles they play in the marine environment, Estes said. But their large body sizes and high metabolic rates make them important players in ocean food webs, and they are found throughout the world's oceans.</p>
<p>"The whales were and are important just because they are so big and so abundant," Estes said. "How different are the oceans when you remove these animals? That's what we wanted to explore."</p>
<p>This question has important implications for the conservation and management of the great whales. Management strategies must be considered not only in terms of their effects on the sustainability of whale populations, but also in terms of how they will affect the broader ocean ecosystems in which whales are key players.</p>
<p>In the book's introduction, Estes describes how he stumbled onto this issue in the first place through his investigations into the collapse of the sea otter population in southwest Alaska. He and his colleagues came to suspect that killer whale predation was causing the sea otter decline. They eventually proposed that whaling prompted a dietary shift in killer whales that had previously preyed on large whales. As the great whales became scarce, the killer whales turned to smaller marine mammals, including seals, sea lions, and sea otters, all of which underwent marked population declines (see earlier <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=683">press release</a>). This remains a highly controversial hypothesis, and various aspects of it are examined in several chapters of the new book.</p>
<p>Contributors to the volume include ecologists, population biologists, physiologists, geneticists, oceanographers, economists, and experts in environmental policy and law. In addition to the editors, several UCSC scientists contributed to various chapters, including biologists Donald Croll, Bernie Tershy, and Daniel Costa, oceanographer Raphael Kudela, and biostatistician Marc Mangel.</p>
<p>Estes said many of the questions raised at the workshop remain unresolved. But the book provides a wealth of information for anyone interested in these issues.</p>
<p>"Our hope is that this book will stimulate more research on the role of whales in ocean ecosystems," Estes said.</p>

<p>The EPA's College and University Green Power Partners, which promotes purchases of renewable resources, has named UC Santa Cruz its sixth largest green power purchaser in the country. The list is based on purchases through Dec. 31, 2006. (See the EPA's <a href="http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/partners/top10ed.htm">top 10 list</a>.</p>
<p>"Based on national average utility subregion emissions rates, the U.S. EPA estimates that UC Santa Cruz's purchase is equivalent to avoiding the carbon dioxide emissions of nearly 7,000 cars per year, or avoiding the equivalent carbon dioxide emissions associated with nearly 3.6 million gallons of gasoline annually," said James Critchfield of the EPA's Climate Protection Partnerships Division.</p>
<p>"EPA applauds the University of California at Santa Cruz for its recent purchase of green power," said Bill Wehrum, acting assistant administrator of EPA's office of air and radiation. "The students, faculty and administration are taking action to address the impact they have on the environment. They are also looking out for their own mascot--the banana slug--one of nature's most unique species. It's an excellent example of how sustainability can be linked to the broader educational mission of a university."</p>
<p>"UC Santa Cruz is honored to be included in this elite list," said UC Santa Cruz Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal. "Our students' purchase of renewable energy is an especially heartening contribution to our efforts to promote conservation and clean energy throughout campus. I want to thank our students for their generosity and the UC Santa Cruz Physical Plant for its effectiveness in making this recognition possible."</p>
<p>Students voted last spring to pay $3 more in tuition each quarter to purchase clean, sustainable energy. Tapping the student-generated fund, the campus purchased 50 million kilowatt hours of clean energy in the form of renewable energy certificates. The purchase, on top of UC Santa Cruz's already existing electrical contract for 5 million kilowatt hours of renewable power, means the campus is now considered 100 percent green-offsetting all its projected electrical consumption for fiscal 2006-07.</p>
<p>"The UCSC clean energy ballot initiative is a clear example of how students can take leadership on their campus and push for tangible change," said Tommaso Boggia, the student who spearheaded the effort for a fee increase. "Students and administrators have joined forces to fight global warming," Boggia said. "Only by continuing to reduce and refocus our consumption patterns will we be able to protect our planet."</p>
<p>Boggia, who plans to graduate in June, now works with UC Santa Cruz Physical Plant energy manager Patrick Testoni, and the two hope the campus's green energy purchases can become a model for the rest of the UC system. The UCSC purchase agreement with Sterling Planet includes a clause extending the low price to other campuses that may follow its lead.</p>
<p>"Serious use of clean, sustainable energy on a large scale is no longer a dream for the future--it's here," said U.S. Rep. Sam Farr. "I'm proud of the students here at UCSC for proactively voting to turn their campus into a green energy campus. California, the UC system, and UCSC in particular have a tradition of being innovators, not just in developing new ideas but in implementing those ideas. It's good to see that tradition continue," he added.</p>
<p>Green power includes electricity that is entirely generated from clean resources, such as solar, wind, geothermal, biogas, biomass, and low-impact hydropower. It is considered cleaner than conventional sources of electricity and has lower carbon dioxide emissions, a greenhouse gas linked to global climate change. Purchases are designed to accelerate the development of new renewable energy nationwide. At UCSC, the renewable energy sources purchased from Sterling Planet, a national renewable energy provider, were wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower, biomass, and landfill gas.</p>
<p>The renewable energy purchase is part of a larger commitment to renewable energy and environmental awareness throughout the UCSC campus. UCSC already participates in the alliance to save energy's green campus program and has partnered with the California public utilities commission and investor-owned utilities to retrofit equipment for conservation purposes. Completion of equipment retrofitting and energy-efficient building design has resulted in savings of 975,000 kilowatt hours of electricity and 26,000 therms of natural gas annually. Alternative-transportation programs include vanpooling, bicycle shuttles, carpooling, and Metro bus access for all faculty, students, and staff. Water use has also been targeted, resulting in a 32 percent reduction in per-student water consumption over the past 10 years. Issues of sustainability in agriculture have been confronted as well, with a mandate that locally grown organic produce be served in campus dining halls and eateries and that used cooking oil be recycled.</p>
<p>Environmental issues play a major role in classrooms and in campus research as well. UC Santa Cruz's environmental studies program, established in the early 1970s as one of the first such programs in the nation, focuses on conservation biology, environmental policy, political economy, and agroecology and sustainable food systems.

<p>Three generous supporters of UCSC&#8212;Anne Neufeld Levin, Robert Stephens, and Julie Packard&#8212;will receive a major campus honor at the upcoming Scholarships Benefit Dinner, a gala celebration dedicated to making the dream of higher education a reality for all students.</p>
<p>Now in its fourth year, UCSC's benefit dinner has become an important fundraising event supporting undergraduate and graduate scholarships and fellowships. It will take place at 6 p.m. on Saturday, February 3, at Seascape Resort in Aptos.</p>
<p>The campus will award two Fiat Lux ("Let there be light") Awards at the event: one to Anne Neufeld Levin and one presented jointly to Julie Packard and Robert Stephens.</p>
<p>Award recipient Anne Levin is a tireless advocate for the campus. A past president of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, she has served as a Foundation trustee for 19 years. She has contributed to programs, organizations, and capital projects across the campus, including scholarships; the University Library; the Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community; the Seymour Marine Discovery Center; and research and teaching in the natural sciences and humanities. Levin, who escaped Austria with her family in 1939, also endowed the Neufeld Levin Chair in Holocaust Studies in 1995, which is further enhanced by her family's archive in Special Collections of the University Library. A Santa Cruz resident since 1964, Levin and her husband, Paul, own Palco Labs, a Santa Cruz-based company that develops medical products and devices.</p>
<p>Julie Packard and Robert Stephens are spouses, graduates of UCSC, and longtime residents of Soquel. They have helped UCSC as volunteers and financial supporters in such areas as the Arboretum, Predatory Bird Research Group, Shakespeare Santa Cruz, Friends of Long Marine Lab, and Seymour Marine Discovery Center.</p>
<p>Packard has also contributed to Crown College at UCSC. Executive director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which she helped found in 1975, Packard earned bachelor's and master's degrees in biology at UCSC. She has been a trustee of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation for more than 25 years, chairing its Conservation Program Committee, which oversees a nationwide environmental grant-making program.</p>
<p>In addition to serving on the Friends of Long Marine Lab board for many years, Stephens was cochair of the capital campaign committee for the Seymour Marine Discovery Center. He also serves on the Packard Foundation board, and owns the Elkhorn Native Plant Nursery near Elkhorn Slough. Stephens has a bachelor's degree in psychology from UCSC.</p>
<p>The inaugural Fiat Lux Award was presented to campus and community benefactor Jack Baskin at last year's Scholarships Benefit Dinner, in November 2005.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the annual dinner provide undergraduate scholarships, internships, research opportunities, and graduate fellowships. Many recipients are students who might not otherwise be able to attend UCSC. The dinner draws community members as well as university leadership, UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustees, elected officials, students, distinguished alumni, and regional leaders.</p>
<p>Individuals may purchase tickets to the dinner for $200, or may sponsor a table for $2,000 and up. RSVPs are due by January 12. For more information, call (831) 459-5003 or e-mail<a href="mailto:specialevents@ucsc.edu">specialevents@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
