<p>The chairman of Dubai-based Afras Ventures and former Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations, Tharoor will present an insider's look at the topic of "Globalism, Terrorism, and the Human Imagination."</p>
<p>Tharoor was the official candidate of India to succeed UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in 2006, and came in a close second out of seven contenders in the race. His career began in 1978 when he joined the staff of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva. Tharoor went on to assume key responsibilities in peace-keeping after the Cold War and to work as a senior adviser to the UN Secretary-General.</p>
<p>Tharoor is the author of nine books and hundreds of articles, op-eds and book reviews for a wide range of publications that include the <em>New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, International Herald Tribune, Time, Newsweek</em> and <em>The Times of India</em>. He has served for two years as a contributing editor and occasional columnist for <em>Newsweek International</em>. For the past six years, he has also authored a column in <em>The Hindu</em> and, since January, in <em>The Times of India</em>.</p>
<p>Tharoor's six non-fiction books include <em>Reasons of State</em> (1981), a study of Indian foreign-policy making; <em>India: From Midnight to the Millennium</em> (1997), which was cited by President Clinton in his address to the Indian Parliament; <em>Nehru: The Invention of India</em> (2003), a biography of India's first prime minister; <em>Bookless in Baghdad</em> (2005), a collection of literary essays; and <em>The Elephant, the Tiger, &amp; the Cell Phone</em> (2007), a look at how India has rapidly moved from a largely underdeveloped country to a bustling, innovative society.</p>

<p>His three novels are the classic <em>The Great Indian Novel</em> (1989), which is required reading in several courses on post-colonial literature; <em>Riot</em> (2001), a searing examination of Hindu-Muslim violence in contemporary India; and <em>Show Business</em> (1992), which received a front-page accolade in the <em>New York Times Book Review</em> and has since been made into the motion picture, <em>Bollywood</em>.</p>
<p>In 1998, Tharoor was named a "Global Leader of Tomorrow" by the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He is the recipient of a Commonwealth Writers' Prize, and in 2004 received the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman award from the president of India. Tharoor serves on the advisory boards of the World Policy Journal, the Virtue Foundation and the human rights organization Breakthrough. He is also a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities.</p>
<p>Born in London in 1956, Tharoor was educated in India and the United States, completing a Ph.D. in 1978 at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. A compelling and effective speaker, Tharoor is fluent in English and French. His books have been translated into French, German, Italian, Malayalam, Marathi, Polish, Romanian, Russian and Spanish.</p>
<p>The Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture at UCSC was established in 2001 by former UC Santa Cruz Foundation President Anuradha Luther Maitra to honor the memory of her late husband, who was a distinguished scientist and visionary entrepreneur.</p>
<p>"This is a very personal lecture series," Luther noted. "The university trusts me to suggest a speaker; I trust the speaker to select a topic and present a perspective that is consistent with the views of my late husband. Shashi is a perfect choice--people have only to come hear him to know why."</p>
<p>Tickets are $25 per person, $15 for students with ID, available online at www.montalvoarts.org or by calling the Montalvo Box Office at (408) 961-5858.</p>
<p>Note: Those attending the lecture are welcome to arrive one hour early to preview an exhibition titled <em>Moments from 20th Century Iraqi Art</em>, which will open the following day at the Montalvo Arts Center.</p>

Peckham.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>After meeting with Hawaiian and Japanese fishermen in August, a leading Mexican shark fisherman declared that he would immediately stop using the longlines that kill hundreds of endangered loggerhead turtles each year. His declaration resulted from a unique international program that has brought together fishermen from across the Pacific Ocean to brainstorm solutions that will enable them to conserve sea turtles while maintaining livelihoods and traditional fishing practices. </p><p>UCSC graduate student Hoyt Peckham, through his work with the conservation group Pro Peninsula, organized an international delegation of fishermen, scientists, and community leaders that has traveled to fishing communities in Mexico, Japan, and Hawaii. The delegation has been traveling along the vast migratory route of the loggerhead turtle, meeting with fishing communities to raise awareness of sea turtle conservation and to share experiences and ideas. </p><p>"By talking about what they have learned, fishermen are enabling and inspiring their peers to develop workable, effective solutions," said Peckham, whose thesis research for a Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology focuses on loggerhead turtles of the North Pacific Ocean. </p><p>Born on the beaches of southern Japan, North Pacific loggerhead turtles migrate across the Pacific via the Hawaiian Islands. Despite efforts by sea turtle conservation experts in the United States, Mexico, and Japan, the number of nesting females has declined by 50 to 80 percent over the past decade. Loggerheads are under threat from pollution, beach erosion, development, and habitat loss. In addition, incidental bycatch from fisheries is a major threat to their survival.</p><p>Loggerhead turtles are very long-lived, taking at least 30 years to reach reproductive maturity. As a result, there are far more juveniles in the population than adults. In Baja California, the juveniles feed and mature until they reach reproductive age, then return to Japan to mate and nest. Although dangerously few loggerheads are left, they appear to be numerous to Mexican fishermen, because the turtles spend decades maturing in the rich waters off Mexico's Baja California peninsula. </p><p>In the course of his thesis research, Peckham discovered that small-scale fisheries can have catastrophic effects on the turtle population. With funding from the UC Institute for Mexico and the United States (UC MEXUS), he partnered with local fishermen in Baja California to study loggerhead habitat use and bycatch problems. He incorporated conservation goals into his research project, working with fishermen to reduce bycatch and study it at the same time. </p><p>Seed funding from UC's Pacific Rim Research Program enabled Peckham to bring a leading Japanese loggerhead turtle specialist to Mexico to share with Mexican fishermen the impact of their bycatch on the nesting turtle population in Japan. The success of that visit led to the fishermen's exchange program that brought together representatives of fishing communities from Mexico, Hawaii, and Japan, with support from the Japan Foundation and the World Wildlife Fund. </p><p>According to Peckham, fishing communities can play a crucial role in protecting loggerhead turtles. "The fishermen discuss the full costs of bycatch, such as time and resources lost to disentangling turtles and repairing damaged nets. We find that once fishermen appreciate the Pacific-wide impact and true costs of their local actions, they usually strive to reduce and eliminate their bycatch," he said.</p><p>The exchange program Peckham helped organize includes Hawaiian fishermen who have successfully reduced their bycatch through gear modifications. According to Juan Ignacio Romero, a fisherman from San Juanico, Baja California Sur, Hawaiian fishermen are setting an example for others.</p><p>"The world needs to hear about their achievements and the fact that they are still making a living from fishing," Romero said.</p><p>As a result of his participation in the exchange, Efrain de la Paz, the patron of a Mexican shark fishing fleet, declared that he would no longer use the deadly bottom-set longlines that are such a menace to loggerheads. His announcement represents a monumental breakthrough in loggerhead conservation, as each of his fleet's six skiffs was killing more loggerheads per day than any other fishery or fleet on record, according to Peckham. </p><p>"Prior to this program, we didn't realize the global impact of our local bycatch. Once we understood, we saw that our bycatch was an embarrassment and grave problem," de la Paz said. He is now working with fishermen from Hawaii and Japan to adopt other fishing techniques that will enable him to maintain his catch levels. </p><p>Peckham organized the exchange program through Pro Peninsula, a nonprofit organization that offers support to conservation groups on the Baja California peninsula. One of the program's cofounders is Wallace J. Nichols, scientific adviser to Pro Peninsula and senior scientist with Ocean Conservancy. "Science alone isn't enough to save sea turtles and other species," Nichols said. "Hope lies with local communities working together internationally and sharing real-world ideas."</p><p>Nichols and Peckham have found that the conservation message is more credible coming from peers than from conservationists. "The real solutions will come from local fishermen," Peckham said.</p><p>For more information about the exchange program, visit the Pro Peninsula <a href="http://www.propeninsula.org">web site</a> or contact Hoyt Peckham at hoyt@propeninsula.org.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915338e58072704601a012ff4df0609b"><name>1603</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Police stepping up enforcement October 2</title><summary>Campus police will be hosting a countywide day of stepped-up enforcement of traffic laws throughout campus on Tuesday, October 2.</summary><keywords>police, enforcement, tickets</keywords><description>Campus police will be hosting a countywide day of stepped-up enforcement of traffic laws throughout campus on Tuesday, October 2.</description><start-date>1191222000000</start-date><display-name>Police stepping up enforcement...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1603</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1603</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338404511</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338404511</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Campus police will be hosting a countywide day of stepped-up enforcement of traffic laws throughout campus on Tuesday, October 2.</p><p>Dubbed "BADGES," for "Before Aggressive Drivers Get Everybody Stopped," the initiative will focus on pedestrians, drivers, and bicyclists, and include seat-belt violations, speeding, and equipment violations such as broken or nonfunctioning brake lights. </p><p>Police from neighboring jurisdictions, including the cities of Santa Cruz, Watsonville, Scotts Valley, and Capitola, as well as Santa Cruz County sheriff's deputies and the California Highway Patrol, will participate in the stepped-up enforcement on the UCSC campus.

The two species are separated by 5,000 miles and 175 million years of evolution, yet they share behavioral and reproductive details right down to the gaudy colors of the males, according to new research published in the November issue of <i>American Naturalist</i> and now available online.</p>
<p>The triangle of competing strategies, which biologists liken to the children's game rock-paper-scissors, may be far more common than previously recognized--and may even shape the way humans behave, according to lead author Barry Sinervo, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"The models we propose in this paper are a general phenomenon for all animals, humans included," Sinervo said. When faced with the task of gathering food or finding mates, he said, "You either cooperate, or take by force, or take by deception. Those are the three ways you can make a living in any social system. It's one of those basic games that structures life."</p>
<p>Male European common lizards <i>(Lacerta vivipara)</i> adopt one of those three strategies when pursuing females. A quick look at their undersides reveals the strategy: males who sport orange bellies are brutes who invade other lizards' territories to mate with any female they can catch. But while they're gone, drab yellow-bellied males slink onto the vacant territory and mate with unguarded females. White-bellied males guard their mates closely, and cooperate with other white-bellied lizards to keep the yellows at bay. Hence the analogy to rock-paper-scissors: force (orange) defeats cooperation (white), cooperation defeats deception (yellow), and deception defeats force.</p>
<p>Predicted to exist by evolutionary theorists Sewall Wright in 1968 and John Maynard Smith in 1982, rock-paper-scissors games were not discovered in nature until 1996, when Sinervo described the dynamic in the side-blotched lizard <i>(Uta stansburiana)</i> of western North America. Sinervo said he had expected to find other species playing rock-paper-scissors games, too.</p>
<p>"What's an incredible surprise is that it's so exactly the same, even right down to the same colors," he said. "That's kind of amazing because it says either the game has evolved twice or it's a game that's been played since the time of the dinosaurs, when the two species last shared an ancestor."</p>
<p>There are a few minor differences: in the American lizards the throats, not the bellies, are colored. The white-bellied form in Europe is matched by a blue-throated form in North America--although the two colors are similar in the ultraviolet spectrum, which lizards can see.</p>
<p>To investigate the social strategies of European common lizards, Sinervo and his colleagues spent five years studying lizards at five sites in the Pyrenees mountains of France. They captured more than 250 lizards per year, followed their successes and failures, and ran them on treadmills to gauge their physical prowess. The effect of the social system, they discovered, is a steady cycling of the prevalent color type in the population every four to eight years.</p>
<p>The cycle goes like this: one color type--orange, for example--is common in a patch of habitat for a year or two. During that time, the orange bullies spend their time attacking white-bellied lizards on nearby territories. The effort leaves females on their own territories unguarded, allowing yellow-bellied lizards to sneak in and sire offspring. So yellow males become prevalent for the next year or two. After that, white-bellied lizards proliferate as they team up to protect their mates from yellows' intrusions. But once the white-bellied males become numerous, they're easy pickings for the remaining orange-bellied males, who regain superior numbers as the cycle starts again.</p>
<p>Such rock-paper-scissors games may prove to be commonplace throughout the animal kingdom, Sinervo said. The dynamic may just be harder for biologists to find in animals that don't broadcast their affiliation with bright colors. Mammals, for example, may use scent as their signal.</p>
<p>"I like to think of it this way," Sinervo said. "If we were Labrador retrievers, maybe we could smell the rock-paper-scissors game all over the place."</p>
<p>Showy male lizards could be just the most obvious examples. Sinervo speculated that the population booms and busts of lemmings, voles, and hares could come from a similar interplay among reproductive genes in females.</p>
<p>Humans are not immune to the dynamic either. We are far more complex than lizards, but that just means we find more opportunities to adopt the role of aggressor, cooperator, or deceiver. "We play games along an economic axis, a reproductive axis, a familial axis, a political axis. We've constructed all this complexity around ourselves," Sinervo said.</p>
<p>Systems with more than three competing strategies could occur, Sinervo said, but they would tend to simplify themselves into a triangular rock-paper-scissors arrangement because triangular relationships are mathematically more stable.</p>
<p>Sinervo is now trying to map the genes responsible for the behavioral strategies of the European common lizard. This would settle the question as to whether the two species' last common ancestor engaged in similar struggles back in the time of the earliest dinosaurs. The alternative is that the behavior--and the accompanying color patches--evolved at least twice.</p>
<p>"That tells you how ancient the game is," Sinervo said. "If the same genes are involved in both species, then it's been played since the time snakes and lizards diverged. These lizards separated from each other even before the Atlantic ripped open. They may have been playing the same old broken record for 175 million years."</p>
<p>Sinervo's coauthors include Benoit Heulin and Yann Surget-Groba of the National Scientific Research Center (CNRS), Paimpont, France; Jean Clobert, of the CNRS Biological Station at Moulis, France; Donald Miles, of Ohio University; UCSC graduate students Ammon Corl and Alison Davis; and former UCSC graduate student Alexis Chaine.</p>

Some key steps that everyone can take include:</p><p>. Use good, cryptic passwords that can't be easily guessed--and keep your passwords secret</p><p>. Make sure your computer's operating system and applications are protected with all necessary security "patches" and updates</p><p>. Make sure your computer is protected with up-to-date antivirus software</p><p>. Don't click on unknown or unsolicited links or attachments, and don't download unknown files or programs onto your computer</p><p>. Remember that information and passwords sent via standard, unencrypted wireless are especially easy for hackers to intercept </p><p>To help reduce the risk, make sure web pages have <i>https,</i> (not <i>http,</i>) in the web address (URL) before you enter any sensitive information or a password. Also avoid standard, unencrypted e-mail and unencrypted Instant Messaging (IM) if you're concerned about privacy</p><p><b>E-mail scams</b></p><p>It is important to remember that cyber-criminals are constantly coming up with new e-mail scams, so be alert. Deceptive e-mails often look legitimate but are designed to compromise vulnerable computers or steal information.</p><p>Some key indicators that an e-mail is not legitimate--even if it appears to be from a company or person you are familiar with--are:</p><p>. It is not addressed to you personally</p><p>. The sender isn't specified, isn't someone you know, or doesn't match the "from" address</p><p>. It has spelling or grammatical errors</p><p>. It has a link that doesn't look legitimate or doesn't seem to match where the e-mail says the link will take you</p><p>. It is an unsolicited or unexpected e-mail with an attachment, or it has an attachment with a name that doesn't make sense or match what it is supposed to be</p><p>. It is an unsolicited or unexpected e-mail (or phone call) asking you to disclose financial account information, your social security number, your password, or other personal or private information</p><p>. It asks you to update your account information using a link or phone number provided in the e-mail</p><p>. It asks you to send money</p><p>To protect yourself:</p><p>. Don't click on links or open attachments in unsolicited or unexpected e-mail</p><p>. Don't open, respond to or forward spam e-mail</p><p>. If you are uncertain about an e-mail or phone call, contact the sender separately using a method you know is legitimate to verify that the message is from them</p><p>UCSC's Information Technology Services (ITS) <a href="http://its.ucsc.edu/security_awareness/">Security Awareness web site</a> offers a wide range of information about these and many other practical cyber security tips and pointers for safer computing, including:</p><p>.

<p>"We are still sorting through this treasure trove to discover the many gems of information it contains," said Sandra Faber, University Professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Faber worked with Jeffrey Newman of the University of Pittsburgh, Shui Kwok of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, UCSC graduate student Genevieve Graves, and many other members of the AEGIS team to coordinate the data release through Google Sky.</p>
<p>"It is clear that serving astronomical data through Google Sky is going to revolutionize the way astronomers communicate, both among themselves and with the public," Faber said. "AEGIS is proud and pleased to be the pathfinder dataset for Google Sky's new multiwavelength capabilities."</p>
<p>Featured in this week's release are color images from four different satellite telescopes, as well as numerous data catalogs, from x-ray to radio wavelengths, giving brightnesses and distances of tens of thousands of galaxies. Google Earth's new Sky feature provides a fast and powerful access tool for astronomical data similar to what the popular Google Earth software has provided for terrestrial data.</p>
<p>"AEGIS images projected onto the celestial sphere show how it would look with infrared, ultraviolet, or x-ray eyes," Faber said. "Some galaxies look brighter at certain wavelengths than others, which carries important information about their composition and the processes occurring within them."</p>
<p>The rapid browsing abilities of Google Sky provide a new way to compare many views of a single galaxy or a set of galaxies instantly. For researchers, it is a powerful tool for exploring AEGIS's massive data sets. The AEGIS collaboration is also making all of its data available this week on its <a href="http://aegis.ucolick.org">web site</a>, so that researchers can download it directly.</p>
<p>Of the four color images in the first AEGIS data release, the most detailed is a visible-light image stitched together from 63 separate pointings of the Hubble Space Telescope. This image forms the base map in Google Sky. Stretching twice the width of the full Moon, it is the largest unbroken color mosaic ever made with Hubble and contains images of approximately 50,000 faraway galaxies. Light has traveled for more than 10 billion years from the most distant ones, giving us pictures of them as they looked long ago, more than three-quarters of the way back to the Big Bang. The exquisite detail of the Hubble images shows infant and adolescent galaxies as they began to form.</p>
<p>The second image shows the same galaxies through the ultraviolet eyes of NASA's Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) satellite. Ultraviolet wavelengths are shorter and bluer than those of visible light. Massive, hot young stars that are just forming produce ultraviolet light in abundance. Brightness in the GALEX image therefore provides a measure of the rate at which each galaxy is forming stars. Galaxies that contain relatively few hot, young stars or that are obscured by either their own dust or diffuse gas along our line of sight will appear redder in the GALEX image.</p>
<p>The third view is a mosaic of images taken with the Infrared Array Camera on NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, the last mission in NASA's Great Observatory series. Near-infrared brightness is closely related to the total number of stars in a galaxy, while the colors of a galaxy as seen through infrared eyes reveal information on both its contents (stars and dust) and its distance from us.</p>
<p>The fourth image was produced with data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. In the objects seen by Chandra, highly energetic x-ray radiation has been produced when gas is spiralling into a supermassive black hole, like those believed to lie at the center of almost every galaxy. Many of the x-ray-emitting objects lie buried within otherwise normal-looking galaxies. In the x-ray images, the bluest objects are the ones most obscured by gas within their host galaxies.</p>
<p>In combination, these images simultaneously measure the sizes and shapes of galaxies, their current rates of star formation, the total number of stars each galaxy has already formed, and the rate at which a black hole at its center is actively accreting matter. All of this information provides separate clues to help scientists understand the evolution of galaxies over the past 10 billion years.</p>
<p>These images from space-based telescopes are tied together by the spectra of nearly 15,000 AEGIS galaxies taken with the Keck II Telescope in Hawaii as part of the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, led by Faber and Marc Davis of UC Berkeley. Among other information, these spectra enable astronomers to determine distances to these objects, which is crucial for distinguishing small galaxies in the foreground from giant galaxies that appear faint because they are so far away. Once they have determined the distance to a galaxy, astronomers know how far back in time light left it. The most distant galaxies in the AEGIS survey are seen as they looked only a few billion years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>With the Sky feature in Google Earth, users can pan and zoom around all of these pictures of the sky to select individual galaxies for closer inspection. By adjusting the transparency of each image, the user can focus on only one of the AEGIS images at a time, or look at a combination (e.g., the GALEX image superimposed on Hubble). Clicking on galaxies in AEGIS catalogs brings up their distances and intrinsic properties. A further mouse click links the user to the Keck spectrum and additional information being used for AEGIS science studies.</p>
<p>"The simple interface of Google Sky provides great power for exploring astronomical images, for scientists as well as the public," Newman said.</p>
<p>The AEGIS data release is featured this week on the <a href="http://earth.google.com/gallery/index.html">Google Earth Gallery</a>. To use the Sky feature, users must have the most recent version of Google Earth (v. 4.2). From the gallery site, click on "Learn more" to find the link to the AEGIS KML file. The KML file and <a href="http://aegis.ucolick.org/google_sky.html">instructions for viewing the AEGIS images</a> are also available on the AEGIS web site.</p>
<p>This first data release from AEGIS is only the first step. Later releases will feature images taken at far-infrared and radio wavelengths. A master catalog is being prepared that combines information from all of AEGIS's many views of the sky. As future images are prepared, they and the growing data catalogs will all be linked through Google Sky.</p>
<p>The AEGIS <a href="http://aegis.ucolick.org">web site</a> gives more information about the survey, science results to date, and links to additional images and data that can be downloaded. The many windows on the universe provided by AEGIS have already produced a variety of new results on the evolution of galaxies, and many more new findings from the AEGIS team will appear soon, according to Newman.</p>
<p>"With this public release of both interactive images and the underlying data catalogs, the full astronomical community will now be able to take advantage of this powerful new dataset," he said.</p>
<p>The AEGIS teams that contributed images and data for this release include the Hubble team led by Marc Davis of UC Berkeley; the Chandra team lead by Kirpal Nandra of Imperial College, London; the Spitzer team led by Giovanni Fazio of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics; and the GALEX team led by Chris Martin of the California Institute of Technology. Funding for the AEGIS collaboration was provided by the National Science Foundation and NASA.</p>

The all-day event on Friday, October 12--part of the celebrations marking the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Baskin School of Engineering--also features a keynote address by James Hollenhorst of Agilent Laboratories.</p><p>Hollenhorst's talk, "Parallel Revolutions: How Breakthroughs in Electronics and Biology are Converging at the Molecular Scale," will take place at 9:30 a.m. in the Simularium (Room 180) in the Engineering 2 Building on the UCSC campus. Hollenhorst is senior director of intellectual property strategy at Agilent. </p><p>The convergence of biotechnology, information technology, and nanotechnology is among the major focus areas for research at the Baskin School of Engineering. Research Review Day offers a broad view of the exciting work being done at UCSC in many different areas to develop technology for a changing world. The program includes selected presentations by faculty and poster displays of graduate student research.</p><p>"This is a nontraditional engineering school that is tackling the problems of the 21st century," said Michael Isaacson, acting dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. "Engineering is about solving problems, and the Research Review Day will highlight some of the contributions our researchers are making in areas ranging from computer networks to health sciences and sustainable energy technologies."</p><p>The October 12 program is divided into six focus areas that cross departmental boundaries within the engineering school: bio-info-nano technology, cyber-infrastructure, bioengineering, systems design, mathematical and statistical modeling, and software and service engineering. </p><p>Among the faculty who will present their research are <b>Michael Mateas,</b> assistant professor of computer science, who will discuss advances in artificial intelligence and its potential to transform the computer game industry; <b>Raquel Prado,</b> associate professor of applied mathematics and statistics, who will describe her work applying Bayesian models to problems in the health sciences; <b>Joshua Stuart,</b> assistant professor of biomolecular engineering, who will discuss the use of new technologies for studying the responses of genetic networks in living cells; and <b>Ali Shakouri,</b> professor of electrical engineering, who will describe research on thermoelectric power generation for waste-heat recovery.</p><p>Hollenhorst, in his keynote address, will discuss how the techniques of electronics are now being married with those of chemistry and biology to enable the engineering and measurement of structures at the molecular scale. Fundamental to these advances is the emergence of new measurement technologies, and Hollenhorst will describe new methods enabled by applying the techniques of electronics to the problems of life scientists. </p><p>Hollenhorst's talk, which begins at 9:30 a.m., will be followed by faculty presentations from 10:30 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. (with a break for lunch at 12:30 p.m.). A reception featuring graduate student research posters will take place from 3:30 to 5 p.m.</p><p>Research Review Day should be of interest to technology industry leaders, project managers, and engineers who want to connect with UCSC engineering faculty, students, and industry partners.

Estes, a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey and an adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and ocean sciences, is based at the Center for Ocean Health at Long Marine Laboratory. He is expected to serve as STEPS director for at least two years, according to vice chancellor for research Bruce Margon.</p><p>Estes is best known for his groundbreaking research on the ecological role of sea otters in coastal ecosystems. His ongoing research projects deal with the ecology of coastal marine communities in the Aleutian Islands, Central California, and the Channel Islands. He also studies strategies for marine conservation, including research on the effects of marine reserves on rockfish populations in Central California.</p><p>A fellow of the California Academy of Sciences, Estes's awards and honors include a Pew Marine Conservation Fellowship and the USGS Shoemaker Award for Distinguished Achievement in Communication. He earned a B.A. in zoology from the University of Minnesota, M.S. in zoology from Washington State University, and Ph.D. in biological sciences and statistics from the University of Arizona.</p><p>Estes replaces former STEPS director John Thompson, who is currently on sabbatical. Thompson, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, had served as director since the founding of the institute in 2002. </p><p>STEPS stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Policy, and Society. The goal of the STEPS Institute is to foster interdisciplinary research that will help society cope with the rapid changes occurring in all major ecosystems. Much of the work concentrates on ecosystems along California's Central Coast, but funded projects have also included research in areas as diverse as New Zealand, France, Japan, and Central America. Over the past five years, the institute has helped fund the research of more than 80 graduate students, undergraduates, and faculty at UCSC, with projects spanning 11 departments and three divisions. </p><p>Additional information is available on the STEPS <a href="http://www.steps.ucsc.edu/">web site</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9153532d8072704601a012ff7e2d877e"><name>1622</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC professor's documentary to premiere at Mill Valley Film Festival</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1191481200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC professor's documentary to...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1622</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1622</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338411227</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338411227</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/10/images/lucha_poster.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/10/images/lucha_poster.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lucha_poster.250.jpg</name><file-size>47037</file-size><width>250</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>(Graphic courtesy of Gustavo Vazquez)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/10/images/lucha_camera_shot.better.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/10/images/lucha_camera_shot.better.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lucha_camera_shot.better.250.jpg</name><file-size>40439</file-size><width>250</width><height>158</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Gustavo Vazquez behind the camera, on location in Mexico for his documentary film "Que Viva La Lucha (Wrestling in Tijuana)"</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><i>Que Viva la Lucha (Wrestling in Tijuana)</i>--a documentary by UC Santa Cruz assistant professor of film and digital media Gustavo Vazquez--will make its premiere at the 30th annual Mill Valley Film Festival on Saturday, October 13, at 2:30 p.m. </p><p>Simultaneously, the film will also be screened outdoors in a colonial plaza at the Festival Internacional de Cine de Morelia in Mexico. And in November, the documentary will have its European premiere at the Filmstock-Luton International Film Festival in the UK.</p><p>"It's a one-hour video documentary that portrays the cultural tradition of Mexican wrestling at the border and explores social class and border culture through this mythical sport and spectacle," said Vazquez. "In Mexico, the wrestlers forge fictional mythological identities in contrast to their working-class backgrounds, while audiences reward them with superhero status."</p><p>Inspired by his fascination with the double identity of the wrestlers--ordinary people who transform themselves on weekends into larger-than-life characters--Vazquez spent three years working on the film. It was funded primarily through grants from UCSC's Arts Research Institute and the Academic Senate's Committee on Research. </p><p>"I'm interested in this social ritual in what I call the 'therapy of the poor,'" said Vazquez. "The arena is the forum where everyone--wrestlers and public alike--are allowed to unleash their demons. They're re-enacting mythological battles between good and evil."</p><p>Vazquez grew up in Tijuana and was a big fan of the Mexican wrestlers in his early years. Coincidentally, the most famous wrestler in Tijuana--"Rey Misterio"--was a childhood friend, but Vazquez never knew it because the mask he wore kept it a secret. </p><p> </p><p>"For years I'd seen him in the ring, but until I did this piece and met him in person, I didn't know he was a kid I grew up with in the neighborhood," said Vazquez. "This connection opened a lot of doors."</p><p>Vazquez has been making independent films for the past three decades. His eclectic approach to filmmaking includes interdisciplinary projects, mixed genres, and experimental and traditional documentaries. He noted that his "mocumentary," <i>The Great Mojado Invasion (The 2nd U.S.-Mexico War)</i>, created in collaboration with Guillermo Gomez-Pena, "is a classic Chicano sci-fi cult film that continues to be politically relevant to the global anti-immigrant hysteria and is consistently screened in festivals around the world." </p><p><i>Que Viva la Lucha (Wrestling in Tijuana)</i> will be screened twice at the Mill Valley Film Festival: Saturday, October 13, at 2:30 p.m., at the Christopher B. Smith Rafael Film Center in San Rafael; and Sunday, October 14, at 4 p.m., at the 142 Throckmorton Theater in Mill Valley. </p><p>Vazquez said he hopes that his film will get international distribution to call attention to the magical spectacle of Mexican wrestling. "For me, it's important to divulge the humor and sensibility of the Mexican people as manifested in this sport," he noted. "What I really want is to inspire people to live out their dreams--even if they have to live double lives." </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915354d98072704601a012ff91b20c4e"><name>1624</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Scientists study tiny galaxy halfway across the universe</title><summary>A tiny galaxy nearly halfway across the universe, the smallest in size and mass known to exist at that distance, has been identified and studied by an international team of over a dozen scientists, including four at UCSC.</summary><author>Tim Stephens, (831) 459-2495, stephens@ucsc.edu; or Gail Gallessich, UC Santa Barbara, (805) 893-7220, gail.g@ia.ucsb.edu</author><keywords>adaptive optics,David Koo, Claire Max</keywords><description>A tiny galaxy nearly halfway across the universe, the smallest in size and mass known to exist at that distance, has been identified and studied by an international team of over a dozen scientists, including four at UCSC.</description><start-date>1191481200000</start-date><display-name>Scientists study tiny galaxy...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1624</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1624</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338411661</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338411661</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/10/images/einstein_ring_300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/10/images/einstein_ring_300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>einstein_ring_300.jpg</name><file-size>38068</file-size><width>300</width><height>292</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Keck Telescope image shows the bright elliptical lens galaxy and its Einstein ring.

<p>The galaxy is about half the size, and approximately one-tenth the "weight" of the smallest distant galaxies typically viewed with the Hubble Space Telescope, and it is 100 times smaller in mass than our own Milky Way. Astronomers were able to observe it because a massive galaxy in the foreground acts as a "gravitational lens," focusing light from the more distant galaxy.</p>
<p>"By using the foreground galaxy as a cosmic gravitational lensing telescope, we have multiplied by 10-fold the sharpening power of our Keck Telescope in Hawaii, giving us the equivalent of a telescope with a mirror the size of a football field," said David Koo, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC and a coauthor of the paper. "This gives us a glimpse of an ancient pygmy galaxy like those that may have built up our home galaxy, the Milky Way."</p>
<p>The Hubble Space Telescope and the Keck II Telescope in Hawaii were both used in this research, which will be published in the December 20 issue of the <em>Astrophysical Journal.</em> The article is now available <a href="http://www.arXiv.org">online</a>.</p>
<p>"Even though this galaxy is more than 6 billion light years away, the reconstructed image is as sharp as the ordinary ground-based images of the nearest structure of galaxies, the Virgo cluster, which is 100 times closer to us," said lead author Phil Marshall, a postdoctoral fellow at UC Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>Second author Tommaso Treu, assistant professor of physics at UCSB, explained that the image of the newly discovered galaxy appears as an "Einstein Ring" due to gravitational lensing. Light from distant galaxies is deflected on its way to Earth by the gravitational field of any massive object that lies in the way. Because the light bends, the galaxy is distorted into an arc or multiple separate images. When both galaxies are exactly lined up, the light forms a bull's-eye pattern, called an Einstein ring, around the foreground galaxy.</p>
<p>The combination of optical and near-infrared images from the Hubble Space Telescope and longer-wavelength images obtained from the Keck Telescope enabled astronomers to estimate the mass of the galaxy and infer that many of its stars had formed only recently.</p>
<p>"If the galaxy is representative of a larger population, it could be one of the building blocks of today's spiral galaxies, or perhaps a progenitor of modern dwarf galaxies," Treu said.</p>
<p>A key aspect of the research is the use of "laser guide star adaptive optics" at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Adaptive optics (AO) systems use a bright reference point in the field of view to measure the Earth's atmospheric blurring and correct for it by deforming the telescope's mirrors in real time. The Keck laser guide star AO system uses a powerful laser to illuminate a layer of sodium atoms in the Earth's upper atmosphere. The result is an "artificial star" bright enough to perform AO corrections at any position in the sky, thus enabling much sharper imaging over most of the sky.</p>
<p>Several members of the team are affiliated with the Center for Adaptive Optics (CfAO) at UCSC, including Claire Max, CfAO director and a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC; postdoctoral fellow Jason Melbourne; graduate student S. Mark Ammons; and David Le Mignant of the W. M. Keck Observatory. The Keck AO data were collected by Melbourne as part of the CfAO Treasury Survey (CATS).</p>
<p>Other researchers involved in the project are Raphael Gavazzi of UC Santa Barbara; Kevin Bundy of the University of Toronto, Canada; Adam S. Bolton of the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii; Scott Burles of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; James Larkin of the University of California, Los Angeles; Leon V.E. Koopmans of the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute, the Netherlands; Leonidas A. Moustakas of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology; Eric Steinbring of the University of Victoria, Canada; and Shelly A. Wright of UC Los Angeles.</p>
<p>This research is supported by NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the Sloan Foundation.</p>

<p>The university and the company are partnering to join the Energy Star Change a Light, Change the World Campaign, a movement to encourage people to help make a difference one energy-saving step at a time.</p>
<p>The nationwide campaign aims to build community, save energy, and help fight global warming through the use of energy-efficient lighting technology.</p>
<p>During October, campus representatives will distribute up to 5,000 compact fluorescent lightbulbs (CFLs) donated by PG&amp;E to the campus community. The giveaway is being conducted by the Green Campus Program, which is made up of four student interns (Francesca Benedetti, Rachel Shiozaki, Katie Landeros and David Chang), in coordination with UCSC.</p>
<p>The giveaway is a good awareness-builder, said Patrick Testoni, Physical Plant energy manager.</p>
<p>"The fact PG&amp;E is giving them away for free will have a big impact," he said.</p>
<p>Testoni estimated the 5,000 CFLs given away on campus would prevent 200,000 pounds of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere per year, the equivalent of taking 17 vehicles off the road.</p>
<p>The CFLs being handed out are certified by Energy Star, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy joint program, last 6-10 times longer than regular incandescent lightbulbs, use 75 percent less energy than ordinary bulbs, and individually can prevent more than 400 pounds of greenhouse gas emissions over their lifetime.</p>
<p>Green Campus interns will give away these bulbs in compostable goody bags containing informational handouts, energy-saving tip sheets, and instructions for proper bulb disposal. In exchange, participants must sign the Energy Star "Change a Light" pledge.</p>
<p>The interns will be at the following times, dates, and locations:</p>

But linguists estimate that nearly half of these will be gone within the next hundred years, an extinction rate equivalent to one language lost every two weeks.</p><p>Throughout history, language loss has been attributable to such human behaviors as war or to natural events like earthquakes or tsunamis. In recent decades, however, the erosion is driven more by economic and cultural pressures. "People are abandoning their native languages in favor of globally dominant tongues such as English, Spanish, Arabic, or Mandarin Chinese," notes UC Santa Cruz linguistics professor Judith Aissen. </p><p>"Parents around the world want their children to speak mainstream languages to give them an economic advantage," Aissen says. The result of this transformation: half of the world's population now speaks just 10 languages.</p><p>Aissen and other linguists liken the magnitude of this language loss to the decline of plant and animal species. "When a language dies, it takes with it a vast array of knowledge--the stories of plants and their medicinal uses, songs, history, art, culture, and the very identity of the people--which is embedded in their language," says Aissen. As a result, a concerted effort has been undertaken by experts in the past decade to document currently spoken languages and, where possible, reverse the trend.</p><p>Aissen's own research focus is on Tzotzil, a language spoken by about 250,000 people in Chiapas, the southernmost state of Mexico, and one of 30 Mayan languages still spoken in Mexico and Guatemala. Since 1995, she has made repeated trips to the area to teach indigenous Mayan speakers there how to analyze and help preserve their languages. </p><p>"I teach workshops in syntax to native speakers--undergraduates and grad students in linguistics-so they can do research on their own languages," Aissen says. "I'm giving them the analytical tools to play a leading role in the analysis and documentation of their languages. When you have people doing scientific work on a language, it has the effect of raising the importance of preserving it." </p><p>Aissen cites one student from these summer workshops--an indigenous Mayan speaker working toward a Ph.D. in linguistics at the University of Texas--who is going back to his community and digitally recording his native language. He is also employing assistants from the area and training them to help him. "When people in a community see documenting a language as a worthwhile thing to do, it reinforces the value of the language," notes Aissen. "It is viewed as a heritage worth passing on to their children, and this is essential if a language is to be saved from extinction." </p><p>Several Mayan languages are already extinct and others are highly endangered. While 250,000 remaining speakers of Tzotzil may seem like a large number, Aissen points out that preserving the language is a fragile balancing act, as more members of the community begin to learn Spanish and become bilingual. "The more roads that are built, the more access to education in Spanish, and the more TV sets that are broadcasting Spanish into households, all mean that there is less likelihood that the language will survive," says Aissen.</p><p>Aissen began studying Mayan languages in 1972 as a linguistics graduate student at Harvard where she participated in a long-term anthropology project sponsored by the National Science Foundation. She traveled to San Cristobal de las Casas, a colonial town in the highlands of Chiapas, where she conducted fieldwork with native speakers. After joining the UCSC faculty in 1983, Aissen continued to return to San Cristobal in the summers to carry out her own research. She eventually began teaching workshops under the auspices of research organizations in Mexico and Guatemala with the goal of helping to preserve the threatened Mayan languages.</p><p>But Aissen notes that saving endangered languages is more than the preservation of culture and historical traditions. It's also about exploring the connection between the grammars of different languages and learning more about the way in which the human brain processes language. </p><p>"Linguistics is the scientific study of language," says Aissen. "Linguists are interested in studying what the human capacity for language is; they want to understand the full range that humans can acquire. But a theory based on 5,000 languages will be much richer than one based on 50." </p><p>Or to cite an analogy from the plant world, it's the difference between a botanist having only a few different species to study in a flower shop, or assessing the amazing diversity of the Amazon rainforest.</p><p>"Languages that serve large numbers of people, such as English, become simplified because they have to serve the communication needs of so many people," adds Aissen. "Indigenous languages may actually be more complicated in grammatical structure, and that's a very compelling reason to document them. It's about preserving vital knowledge for future generations."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915359bd8072704601a012ffd692a34b"><name>1627</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Fall Open Staff Forum with Chancellor Blumenthal</title><start-date>1191481200000</start-date><display-name>Fall Open Staff Forum...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1627</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1627</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338412931</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338412931</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Staff Advisory Board will host the fall-quarter Staff "Brown Bag" Open Forum with Chancellor George Blumenthal on Wednesday, October 17, from 12:00 to 1:15 p.m., in the Stevenson Event Center.</p><p>This is the first Open Forum since the appointment of George Blumenthal as our new Chancellor.

At the same time, as part of a new training program in stem cell biology, faculty and students on campus are exploring the ethical issues raised by research involving human embryonic stem cells.</p><p>CIRM was established in 2004 with the passage of Proposition 71, the California Stem Cell Research and Cures Initiative. After overcoming legal challenges, CIRM has distributed more than $200 million in funding for stem cell research at the state's universities and research institutions. </p><p>"The people of California have made an incredible commitment to support this kind of research, which will help us answer important questions in developmental biology," says Sofie Salama, a research biologist in UCSC's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE). </p><p>The proposition that established CIRM was a direct response to restrictions on stem cell research imposed by the Bush administration. Currently, researchers using federal funding can study only the small number of human embryonic stem cell lines in laboratory use as of August 2001. Cell lines isolated after that date cannot be studied in laboratories built or equipped using federal funding. </p><p>A $2.7 million CIRM grant announced in June is funding a shared stem cell research facility in UCSC's Sinsheimer Laboratories Building. Because it is entirely funded by the state, research at this facility is not subject to the federal restrictions, allowing UCSC researchers to work with new lines of human embryonic stem cells. </p><p>Lindsay Hinck, an associate professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology who directs the facility, says the few lines of human embryonic stem cells approved under the federal policy have limited usefulness. "They don't grow well, many of them are contaminated, and they were derived in suboptimal conditions," she says. "So it is really important to be able to bring in new stem cell lines that can open up the potential for medical breakthroughs."</p><p>Growing and studying human embryonic stem cells in the laboratory is difficult and requires specialized equipment and expertise. The research is challenging, and it may take years to translate laboratory findings into medical advances. But the potential benefits are enormous. Hinck and her colleagues are thrilled about the new directions they can now pursue in their investigations. </p><p>"Most of us do basic research using model organisms, like fruit flies or mice, and incredible discoveries get made in simple organisms. But most scientists also want to do the next step, to see how their findings apply to human cells," Hinck says. "With a stem cell research facility at UCSC, we can follow up on our findings in a system where the results directly inform us about potential ways to improve human health."</p><p>	</p><p>Because stem cells are unspecialized, they are able to renew themselves indefinitely and can also differentiate into more specialized cell types. The ability to grow and manipulate human stem cells in the laboratory is already an extremely powerful tool for understanding human development and disease processes. Eventually, stem cells may be used therapeutically to replace damaged or dysfunctional cells in the body.</p><p>The use of human embryonic stem cells for research and, potentially, for medical therapies has raised ethical issues, mostly centering on how the stem cells are acquired. The process of taking stem cells from an embryo disrupts it; stem cells can be grown in culture dishes, but </p><p>the embryo is no longer viable. Human stem cell lines are derived from embryos created in fertility clinics through in vitro fertilization and donated for research purposes with the informed consent of the donors.</p><p>Many people regard the destruction of human embryos as unethical, says Ellen Suckiel, professor of philosophy and provost of Stevenson College. "The moral issues surrounding stem cell research are among the deepest challenges we face today," she says.</p><p>Suckiel teaches an ethics course as part of the stem cell training program, which includes a broad range of courses designed to offer a comprehensive education in stem cell science and ethics. The training program also provides funding for three predoctoral fellows (graduate students) and three postdoctoral fellows engaged in stem cell research. </p><p>UCSC's proposals have fared well in every round of the competition for CIRM grants. The campus has won funding on a par with much larger institutions, such as UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco.</p><p>"We have an interdisciplinary group of biomedical researchers who really interact well together, and we have done a great job coalescing around the goal of bringing stem cell research to Santa Cruz," Hinck says.</p><p>David Feldheim and Bin Chen, both assistant professors of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, received CIRM research grants in March. Feldheim studies the development of neural circuits in the brain, while Chen focuses on the development of cortico-spinal motor neurons, which control voluntary muscle movements and are affected in neurodegenerative diseases and spinal cord injuries.</p><p>"In theory, if we can learn how to create pure populations of neurons from stem cells in the laboratory, they could be transplanted back into people with neurodegenerative diseases," Feldheim says.</p><p>According to Chen, humans have hundreds of thousands of different types of neurons, and in the cortex of the brain there are tens of thousands, all generated from the same stem cell population. "How do the same cells give rise to so many different kinds of neurons? That's the mystery," Chen says. "We are looking for genes that, when they are expressed in stem cells, drive them to become certain types of cortical neurons."</p><p>This is the kind of fundamental information needed before successful stem cell therapies can be developed, says David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.</p><p>"The main thing missing is still basic knowledge about how human cells work," he says. "What happens in a cell as it differentiates from a stem cell into a liver cell or a neuron? We still don't understand how that process occurs. And UCSC is in as good a position as any other university in California to make important contributions in this area."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91535d0f8072704601a012ff7da5e54b"><name>1629</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Composed: A professional musician thrives as a student in UCSC's graduate program in composition</title><summary>This past January, the &lt;i&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/i&gt; identified Sylvain Carton as the "powerhouse alto saxophone player" in one of the Bay Area's "most provocative jazz ensembles."

It was richly deserved praise for the up-and-coming co-leader of the Mitch Marcus Quintet.</p>
<p>Carton, who earned a master of arts degree in music composition from UC Santa Cruz five months <em>after</em> the newspaper tribute, has artistic breadth that demands attention. His musical tastes run from Stravinsky and Bartok, to Mingus and Ellington . . . to Middle-Eastern surf-metal music. "I draw my influences from around the globe--Eastern European, African, Latin American--a lot of traditional music," Carton says. "I really like mixing it up."</p>
<p>As if to prove the point, Carton plays, tours, and records with a mind-boggling array of bands, incorporating a wild range of musical instruments, styles, and personnel.</p>
<p>He is the primary composer for the Japonize Elephants, an eclectic circus-gypsy-bluegrass-klezmer-jazz ensemble of musicians who play vibes, violin, bass, guitar, banjo, accordion, junk percussion, trumpet, flute, and saxophone. Carton also composes and arranges for Amaldecor, an Eastern European/French swing band; for Mega-Mouse, a "cinematic-rawkus-horn-driven spaghetti western" band; and for Aphrodesia, a 10-piece Afrobeat orchestra.</p>
<p>Born 40 miles southwest of Paris in the town of Chartres, Carton lived in France for just 24 days before moving with his parents to Salt Lake City. Over the next 18 years, his family also called Los Angeles and Statesboro, Georgia, home. Carton earned a bachelor of music degree at the Indiana University School of Music in jazz performance, studying classical saxophone and switching to jazz studies along the way. After spending several years playing and touring as a professional musician, he decided to return to school and enrolled in UCSC's graduate music program in 2005.</p>
<p>"The composition program, with its emphasis on world music traditions, was my main draw to UC Santa Cruz," recalls Carton. "The campus had just established a new graduate program in world music with faculty who have a lot of experience and knowledge in that area. So I thought it would be a great opportunity to expand my ideas of composition."</p>
<p>At UCSC, Carton stretched his already extensive musical palette, learning, for example, to play the <em>gayageum,</em> an ancient 12-string Korean instrument, in order to have the ability to compose in that medium. He noted that his adviser, music professor David Evan Jones, was a critical voice in helping him develop his original work.</p>
<p>"Because David was also heavily involved with world music in his own writing, I felt he was better able to understand some of the concepts in my pieces," Carton says. "He was someone I could bounce ideas off of because he understood what I was trying to go for in my compositions."</p>
<p>"It was nice to return to an academic setting and to have my ideas and work questioned by different faculty," Carton adds. "UCSC exposed me to many new ideas and outlooks and offered me a fresh view of my work. Analyzing other people's music also helped me to better express my own ideas about music."</p>
<p>Before earning his master's this past June, Carton had already been commissioned to create music for a PBS documentary, an independent film, and Oakland's Counterpointe dance company.</p>
<p>Since then, he's released a new album, <em>The Special,</em> with the Mitch Marcus Quintet, and he continues to play and compose for his half dozen other bands--including an extended 18-piece version of the jazz quintet called the MMQ + 13 Big Band. He also recently completed work on string arrangements for a new documentary film produced by <em>National Geographic.</em></p>

<p>"I'd like to do more composing for films," Carton says. "I want to use the skills I've gained at UCSC to continue to broaden my horizons with composition. One of the things I enjoyed most about UC Santa Cruz was meeting fellow students and professors with a multitude of interests, who combined to form a great community that inspires creativity."</p>

Within a week, a team led by UC Santa Cruz computer scientist Yi Zhang had already developed a computer algorithm that performed better than the Cinematch system Netflix currently uses to help customers identify movies they'll like.</p><p>The Netflix competition offered a well-defined problem right in line with Zhang's interests. An assistant professor of computer science in the Baskin School of Engineering, Zhang specializes in tools for managing large amounts of electronic information. She uses artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to develop computer systems that can learn about a user's interests and preferences from each interaction and thereby help people find the information they need more efficiently. </p><p>The Netflix contest, which will continue through 2011, now involves nearly 20,000 teams from 150 different countries. The company has made its enormous dataset-about 100 million movie ratings by customers--available to contestants, hiding personal information and the most recent rating of each customer. The challenge is to predict customers' most recent ratings based on their previous ratings of other movies. Zhang's team was in first place on the contest's online "leaderboard" for months and remains among the top ten teams.</p><p>"It's a very interesting problem, so I play with it when I have the time," she says. "This kind of recommendation system is the future of e-commerce--all the online stores want to make recommendations to their customers."</p><p>Lately Zhang has turned her attention back to ongoing research projects. Her Information Retrieval and Knowledge Management Lab is working on projects funded by companies such as Google, Yahoo, and Cisco, and collaborating with researchers in UCSC's Storage Systems Research Center (SSRC).</p><p>One of Zhang's goals is to develop better search engines for the Internet. She is approaching this problem in various ways, all of which involve computer systems that are able to learn from user feedback to improve the quality of search results over time. </p><p>Search engines like Google do an impressive job of finding web sites related to a search query. But web searches can be frustrating when the most useful sites are buried among thousands of less useful "hits." Zhang envisions a search engine that analyzes your choices as you browse through search results, learning what kinds of sites are most useful to you and using that information to guide subsequent searches. The system might also ask you questions to narrow the search.</p><p>"When you type in a search query, you typically leave out a lot of information about what you're looking for. A personalized search engine can learn to infer what's hidden in the query," Zhang says.</p><p>A related approach, called collaborative information retrieval, optimizes search results based on information from searches performed by other users. Again, it requires a computer system capable of active learning. "In collaborative filtering, the system learns from other people's choices and uses that to guide information retrieval," Zhang says. </p><p>Whereas search engines "pull" information from the web in response to a query, a personalized system could also be designed to "push" information without a query. Currently, savvy web surfers can have "RSS feeds" delivered automatically from their favorite web sites. But first they have to find those sites and request the feeds. What if your computer knew what kinds of information you were interested in and found it for you?</p><p>"The push-based scenario complements the traditional search engine to meet long-term information needs by delivering things like stock information, news, and entertainment. Of course, different users have different criteria, so the computer has to be able to learn from user feedback," Zhang says.</p><p>A computer system with such intimate knowledge of an individual's habits and preferences may be efficient and convenient, but it also raises privacy and security concerns. According to Zhang, however, good system designs can protect privacy and let users control how much information they want to share. "Good designs and good policies can protect privacy to the extent that the user desires," she says.</p><p>Zhang divides her time between an office on the UCSC campus and another at UCSC's Silicon Valley Center. She teaches classes in both locations, has students who work at companies in the valley, and often meets with industry representatives to discuss her research.</p><p>"UCSC is taking the initiative to be the UC campus for Silicon Valley," Zhang says. "I have many part-time students who are working in industry, as well as full-time students on campus. When I taught a data mining course last year at the Silicon Valley Center, I had students from Apple, Intel, and Yahoo." </p><p>Working engineers in Silicon Valley's high-tech industry are a primary target for new degree programs in Technology and Information Management that Zhang is helping to develop at the Baskin School of Engineering. Drawing from traditional fields such as computer science, </p><p>economics, and business management, Technology and Information Management focuses on the use of information technology for more effective management of businesses. </p><p>Zhang's work with SSRC researchers focuses on information retreival from massive databases, such as those maintained by business enterprises. In many respects, Zhang notes, retrieving information from enterprise databases is more challenging than her work on Internet search engines. "Enterprise search problems are pretty difficult. The underlying file system of the database has to be designed to support efficient and effective searching," she says. </p><p>The Netflix challenge, however, is relatively straightforward. The contest will award annual prizes to the team whose system delivers the biggest improvement in the accuracy of the recommendations. Winning the grand prize will require at least a 10-percent improvement over the Cinematch system. "It's a nice, well-defined problem," Zhang says. "But the competition is very tough."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915363168072704601a012ff28126188"><name>1631</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>We Are What They Ate</title><summary>Nathaniel Dominy calls himself a "food guy," because he explores the diet of hominins--the early human ancestors who lived 2 million years ago.</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Nathaniel Dominy, diet of hominins, anthropology</keywords><description>Nathaniel Dominy calls himself a "food guy," because he explores the diet of hominins--the early human ancestors who lived 2 million years ago.</description><start-date>1191567600000</start-date><display-name>We Are What They...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1631</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1631</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338415334</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338415334</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/10/images/dominy_nate.280.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/10/images/dominy_nate.280.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dominy_nate.280.jpg</name><file-size>29226</file-size><width>280</width><height>435</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Nathaniel Dominy's hunt for the dietary jackpot that propelled human evolution has led him underground. Were our early ancestors brainy enough to dig for their dinner? Maybe so, says Dominy. (photo by r. r. jones)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>If anthropologist Nathaniel Dominy had a time machine, he'd set the dial for 2 million years ago and transport himself back in time.</p><p>That way, he'd finally get definitive answers to the questions about human evolution that have fascinated him ever since he picked up a <i>National Geographic</i> magazine at the age of nine. </p><p>"Why are we so different from all other primates? That's the fundamental question," says Dominy, an assistant professor of anthropology at UCSC. "Everyone who studies the past has an innate curiosity about what it was like. We all wish we had time machines, but we have to settle for the fossil record."</p><p>Dominy calls himself a "food guy," because he explores the diet of hominins-the early human ancestors who lived 2 million years ago. His work is at the center of one of the hottest subjects in physical anthropology, because researchers now believe it was a nutritional jackpot that gave our forebears a major advantage over all other primates, fueling the development of bipedalism and big brains. </p><p>But what dietary bonanza changed the path of human evolution? Dominy's quest for answers has led him to bulbs and tubers, familiar to us as onions and potatoes. These nutrient-rich underground plant structures, referred to by the unwieldy moniker "underground storage organs" or USOs, are dietary mainstays of cultures around the globe. The Hadza people of Tanzania, among the world's last hunter-gatherers, rely on starchy tubers for up to 50 percent of their diet. </p><p>The classic way to infer diet is to study teeth, but Dominy has augmented what anthropologists have gleaned from the form and structure of teeth by drawing deeply from the fields of chemistry, molecular biology, and genetics. These interdisciplinary insights have enriched our understanding of the past and helped establish Dominy, 31, as one of the top young researchers in human evolution.</p><p>"Form follows function," explains Dominy, adding that low, flat molars with thick enamel are good for chewing hard foods, while teeth with thin enamel are well-suited for eating fibrous fruits and leaves. Dental similarities have helped shape theories about evolution--and have also misled researchers. For years, anthropologists believed orangutans were most closely related to humans in part because their molar teeth are most like ours, but breakthroughs in molecular biology in the 1980s helped establish that chimpanzees and gorillas occupy that perch on the evolutionary tree.</p><p>Such advances rock the study of human evolution on a fairly regular basis, and Dominy's work is at the cutting edge of the field. He recently weighed in on a conundrum that developed eight years ago when compelling new isotopic evidence gathered from fossilized hominin teeth suggested that our early ancestors subsisted on a diet primarily of grasses and sedges. Researchers were puzzled because their flat teeth appear better adapted for chewing seeds and nuts, rather than tough grass. </p><p>Intrigued by the grassy-diet postulation, Dominy collaborated with UCSC geochemist Paul Koch, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences, and anthropology graduate student Justin Yeakel to see if USOs leave the same chemical signature on tooth enamel as grass, and sure enough, they do. In a clever twist, the team analyzed the enamel of African mole rats, which subsist entirely on USOs. They also tested the fossilized teeth of mole rats taken from sites where hominin fossils were recovered. The enamel of both rat populations matched the hominin signature. So does that mean our distant predecessors ate side-by-side with rodents who lack a sense of smell and are so dumb they literally dig until they hit something to eat? Quite possibly, says Dominy. "We know hominins were advanced enough to use crude digging tools, and they might have been brainy enough to recognize that the dirt mounds left behind by rats were good indicators of where to dig," he says. </p><p>A tireless researcher, Dominy takes nothing for granted. In a line of inquiry that will help anthropologists refine their "form follows function" correlations between teeth and diet, Dominy has field-tested the toughness of roughly 100 edible plants gathered across Africa. "Anthropologists use the terms 'tough' and 'hard' interchangeably, but we need to be more precise about how we characterize hardness," he says. Such distinctions are important because primate teeth changed over the millennia, presumably as diets changed, and Dominy's baseline data help tighten those linkages.</p><p>Dominy's latest avenue of research harnesses one of science's newest tools, the human genome, to probe some of the oldest questions of human evolution. With the aid of molecular genetics, Dominy and his colleague P. J. Perry of Arizona State University have established that humans stand apart from apes in their ability to digest starch, and that the distinction emerged within the timeframe of modern humans-less than 2 million years ago. Moreover, among humans today, the genetic coding that regulates the capacity to process starch </p><p>varies among populations depending on the amount of starch in their diet. This finding suggests that selection favors a higher capacity among those who need it most--more evidence that USOs likely helped fuel human evolution. "It sure looks like a human-specific increase in the copies of a gene that regulates starch digestion might have coincided with an adaptive shift toward eating starchy foods like tubers," he says.</p><p>Regarded as a bold and creative researcher, Dominy is as adept in the field as in the lab. "You learn more from a week in the forest than a semester in the classroom," he says. Each summer, he spends as much time as possible in Africa, crisscrossing the continent to remote areas of Cameroon, Kenya, South Africa, and other countries. He matter-of-factly describes clandestine border crossings, rough four-wheel-drive roads, and 300-mile treks by motorbike followed by 30-mile hikes into the jungle. </p><p>Dominy credits his fieldwork with shaping his research agenda. For example, the hours he has spent observing pygmies foraging for food prompted him to rethink the widely held assumption that their short stature is the result of poor nutrition. Instead, Dominy wonders if being small could be an evolutionary bonus rather than a misfortune in the rainforest, where dense growth requires constant flexing of the hip and knee. </p><p>That kind of out-of-the-box thinking is trademark Dominy. The son of astrophysicists, he hopes one day to use laser technology to quantify the three-dimensional complexity of the forest canopy. It's one of numerous projects on his "to do" list. With his energy and passion, he clearly isn't waiting for a ride on that time machine. In fact, about the only thing he seems to struggle with is the concept of "down time." "I'm not good at that," says Dominy. "I never stop working. I'm always thinking."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915364498072704601a012ff20a04544"><name>1632</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Merrill College to host 'devastating' film on Darfur</title><summary>Merrill College will host Brian Steidle, former U.S. Marine captain and author of &lt;i&gt;The Devil Came on Horseback - Bearing Witness to the Genocide in Darfur.&lt;/i&gt;</summary><keywords>Brian Steidle, Darfur, Devil Came on Horseback</keywords><description>Merrill College will host Brian Steidle, former U.S. Marine captain and author of &lt;i&gt;The Devil Came on Horseback - Bearing Witness to the Genocide in Darfur.&lt;/i&gt;</description><start-date>1191567600000</start-date><display-name>Merrill College to host...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1632</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1632</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338415642</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338415642</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/10/images/devilonhorseback.280.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/10/images/devilonhorseback.280.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>devilonhorseback.280.jpg</name><file-size>29480</file-size><width>280</width><height>415</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Merrill College will host Brian Steidle, former U.S. Marine captain and author of <i>The Devil Came on Horseback - Bearing Witness to the Genocide in Darfur</i> at 6:45 p.m., October 15, in Classroom Unit II. </p><p>The discussion with Steidle will follow a showing of the film <i>The Devil Came on Horseback,</i> which is based on his photography and first-hand testimony.

Urey Prize in Planetary Science this week to Francis Nimmo, associate professor of Earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Nimmo will accept the prize and give an invited lecture on Tuesday, October 9, at a meeting of the division in Orlando, Florida.</p>
<p>The Urey Prize recognizes and encourages outstanding achievements in planetary sciences by scientists age 37 or younger. In announcing the award, the Division for Planetary Sciences praised Nimmo for contributions that have "strongly influenced current thinking about our solar system from Mercury to Neptune."</p>
<p>Nimmo is interested in understanding the structure and evolution of planets and moons. He studies the forces that shape planet surfaces as well as conditions deep inside them, starting with satellite observations and exploring them further with geophysical models. Among his more than 45 scientific publications, he has addressed heat flow on Mercury, plate tectonics on Venus, magma and crust on Mars, and magnetism in the Earth's core. He has also published findings on the outer solar system, including Jupiter's icy moons Europa and Ganymede. His first publication, in 1993, reported new plesiosaur remains from Scotland.</p>
<p>In recent work, Nimmo and his collaborators have made significant contributions to scientific understanding of Saturn's moon Enceladus (see <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1293">press release</a>). He is a member of the NASA Enceladus Science Definition Team and the Committee on Lunar and Planetary Exploration of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Nimmo also won the American Geophysical Union's Macelwane Medal, another honor bestowed on young scientists who demonstrate great talent and productivity.</p>
<p>"Both awards are very competitive and very prestigious," said Gary Glatzmaier, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC. "Winning both clearly means that Francis is currently the top young planetary scientist in the world."</p>
<p>In awarding the Urey Prize to Nimmo, the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society released the following commendation:</p>
<p>"The Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society awards the 2007 Harold C. Urey Prize for outstanding achievement in planetary research by a young scientist to Francis Nimmo, assistant professor of Earth sciences at UC Santa Cruz. A theoretical planetary geophysicist of exceptionally broad interests, Francis has made fundamental contributions to our understanding of the evolution of both terrestrial planets and icy satellites, using their observed surface topography and composition to investigate the evolution of forces responsible for their current states. His creative and provocative body of work has spanned the solar system, from estimates of the crustal thickness of Mercury, the surface and interior dynamics of Venus, and the evolution of the Martian crust to the interpretation of Triton's surface ridges as formed by diurnal tidal stresses. His work incorporates estimates of core and mantle convection, tidal and radiogenic heating, crustal extension and compression, impacts, volcanism, and fluvial erosion. Francis has the skill of defining important problems, devising clever ways to solve them, and developing successful collaborations. He writes with exceptional clarity, thoroughness, and open-mindedness to the idea that even the most beautiful theory is only as strong as its observational support. As a young planetary scientist whose work has strongly influenced current thinking about our Solar System from Mercury to Neptune, the Division for Planetary Sciences is pleased to award the 2007 Harold C. Urey Prize to Francis Nimmo."</p>
<p>Nimmo earned his B.A. and Ph.D. degrees at Cambridge University. He was an assistant professor at UCLA and conducted postdoctoral research at University College London, the California Institute of Technology, and Cambridge. He joined the UCSC faculty in 2005.</p>

Under the grant, a team led by James Kent, associate research scientist at UCSC's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE), will establish a Data Coordination Center for the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project.</p>
<p>In its pilot phase, ENCODE yielded provocative new insights into the organization and function of the human genome (see <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1392">earlier story</a>). Kent's group handled data coordination efforts during the pilot phase, which focused on just 1 percent of the genome. Now, NHGRI is scaling up the ENCODE project to survey the entire genome, awarding more than $80 million in grants to support this next phase.</p>
<p>"The data will be coming from about a dozen different labs, and they'll be generating data on a pretty large scale," Kent said. "Our role is to be good librarians for the data--somewhere between a resource library and Google. So we'll be capturing data from diverse sources, putting it into a database, and building tools that will make it easy for people to find what they're looking for."</p>
<p>Kent's team includes CBSE director David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering, as well as software developers Kate Rosenbloom and Rachel Harte, project manager Donna Karolchik, quality assurance manager Robert Kuhn, graduate student Daryl Thomas, and postdoctoral scholar Ting Wang.</p>
<p>Kent and Haussler played a crucial role in the international Human Genome Project, assembling the finished human genome sequence and making it publicly available to researchers worldwide through the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">UCSC Genome Browser</a>. Kent created the Genome Browser, which now incorporates a wide range of information on the genomes of many different organisms and is a valuable tool used by biomedical researchers throughout the world.</p>
<p>While the sequencing of the human genome was a major scientific achievement, it was just the first step toward the ultimate goal of using genomic information to diagnose, treat, and prevent disease. In recent years, researchers have made major strides in using DNA sequence data to help find genes, which are the parts of the genome that code for proteins. The protein-coding component of these genes, however, makes up just a small fraction of the human genome--about 1.5 percent. There is strong evidence that other parts of the genome have important functions, but very little information exists about where these other functional elements are located and how they work. The ENCODE project aims to address this critical goal of genomics research.</p>
<p>In June, the ENCODE research consortium published a set of landmark papers in the journals <i>Nature</i> and <i>Genome Research</i> that found the organization, function, and evolution of the genome to be far more complicated than most had suspected. For example, while researchers have traditionally focused on studying genes and their associated proteins, the ENCODE data indicate the genome is a very complex, interwoven network in which genes are just one of many types of DNA sequences with functional impact.</p>
<p>"Some of the most exciting parts of the project are telling us how the genome as a whole works together and how genes are regulated," Kent said. "Only about 2 percent of the genome is producing proteins and other molecules that we know are directly functional. It looks like as much or more of the genome is concerned with the control processes that keep the parts working smoothly together."</p>
<p>The ENCODE data will be incorporated into the UCSC Genome Browser as well as other existing tools for exploring and studying the genome. Kent's team will also develop tools specifically designed to handle ENCODE data. On the browser, different tracks enable users to view different kinds of information about a particular sequence in the genome. But the diversity of the ENCODE data, in addition to the shear quantity, presents a challenge.</p>
<p>"We don't want to end up with a thousand different tracks, which would be too much to sort through on the browser. So part of the work is to let users see the data at various levels and be able to dig down to deeper levels of information when they find an area that's particularly interesting," Kent said.</p>
<p>In addition to the Data Coordination Center, CBSE researchers are also working with ENCODE investigators at other institutions on different aspects of the project.</p>
<p>A related project funded by NHGRI, the model organism ENCODE (modENCODE) project, also involves UCSC researchers. Whereas the main ENCODE project focuses on the human genome, modENCODE aims to identify all of the functional elements in the genomes of two widely used model organisms--the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Susan Strome, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, is part of a $7 million modENCODE project to study DNA packaging in the roundworm.</p>

Not a Fallacy Anymore!" is the title of the Fall 2007 Synergy Lecture by Pradip Mascharak, professor of chemistry and biochemistry. The lecture will take place on Thursday, October 18, from 4 to 5 p.m. in the Current Periodicals Room of the Science &amp; Engineering Library. Light refreshments will be available.</p>
<p>Mascharak will discuss the fundamentals and potentials of an intriguing therapy using light to treat cancer and will highlight the unconventional use of nitric oxide in this process.</p>
<p>During the past two decades, the connection between skin cancer and long exposure to sunlight has been established quite firmly. The recent changes in climate related to global warming and the identification of ozone holes further add to this concern. Interestingly, many skin-cancer patients are treated with light of selected frequencies following administration of topical or systemic drugs. This is often referred to as photodynamic therapy.</p>
<p>Mascharak's research group has recently designed and synthesized several molecules that can selectively deliver high doses of nitric oxide to malignant sites and cause cell destruction under the total control of light exposure. The researchers are now testing the feasibility of using these unusual nitric-oxide donors in photodynamic therapy for skin cancer. These nitric-oxide donors may also be employed to combat other localized cancers, such as prostate and breast cancer.</p>

(Photos by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz stands alone as a pioneer of sustainable agriculture, and the campus took a moment Friday afternoon to honor Congressman Sam Farr for his early and visionary support of its agroecology programs.</p>
<p>Long before the concept of agroecology was recognized in Sacramento, then-Assemblyman Farr "consistently and forcefully supported agroecology, small-scale family farming and the need to protect California's environment with ecologically sound farming practices," said Chancellor George R. Blumenthal.</p>
<p>Despite "skepticism and even criticism" from the powerful voices representing traditional agriculture, Farr secured the "seed money" that established UCSC's Agroecology Program and has been a champion of sustainable agriculture research and education ever since, said Blumenthal. "Without Sam's support, we would not have this exemplary and renowned program."</p>
<p>Blumenthal presented Farr with a certificate recognizing his decades-long support of the campus.</p>
<p>Calling UCSC's programs "near and dear to my heart," Farr said there was no place he would rather have been than on campus among the pioneers and contemporary leaders of sustainable agriculture.</p>
<p>Farr hailed UCSC's spirit of innovation and ability to accomplish a lot with minimal resources, and he credited UCSC leaders with fighting for agroecology, even when it meant taking on vested interests within the University of California system who wanted to confine agriculture programs to the Davis and Riverside campuses.</p>
<p>Reading from remarks he entered into the Congressional Record on October 4 to honor the 40th anniversary of sustainable agriculture programs at UCSC, Farr called CASFS "one of the most prominent centers of agricultural research and education in the world." In Congress, Farr has helped secure more than $3 million to support CASFS research and extension projects.</p>
<p>Farr has been a proponent of organic farming since his service in the Peace Corps in Colombia in the 1960s, when he saw the importance of helping people improve their ability to grow food. In UCSC's programs, he recognized the relevance of developing small-scale, intensive, organic food production systems.</p>
<p>Over the years, Farr has made several landmark contributions to UCSC's programs, and CASFS director Patricia Allen thanked him for his commitment to sustainable food and agriculture research and education. As host of the program, Allen read from remarks prepared by environmental studies professor Stephen Gliessman, who was unable to attend the ceremony because he was teaching a class. "We owe the existence of agroecology and CASFS to Sam, and it is up to us to continue to carry his vision of sustainable food systems forward," Allen read on behalf of Gliessman, who was the first director of agroecology and who holds the Alfred E. Heller Chair in Agroecology.</p>
<p>Farr also authored the 1990 state law that established standards for organic food production and sales in California, which became the basis for recent federal organic food standards. In Congress, he has insisted that U.S. Department of Agriculture research stations include a focus on organic agriculture.</p>
<p>Former CASFS director Carol Shennan, a professor of environmental studies, thanked Farr for his recent support of research efforts, including UCSC's Central Coast water monitoring project that has helped farmers reduce pesticide runoff into the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, and for research on regional food systems.</p>
<p>As part of the celebration, Farr and Christof Bernau, manager of the Farm garden, planted an heirloom climbing rose--the first in a new rose garden established in Farr's honor. An adjacent plaque honors Farr for his "visionary support of sustainable food and agriculture research and education." The plaque was fashioned by the UCSC Sign Shop out of redwood reclaimed from the Farm's solar greenhouse, which was recently torn down to make way for a new facility.</p>

Dominy, a gifted young anthropologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has received a prestigious Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering from The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, it was announced today (Tuesday, October 9).</p><p>The Packard Fellowship, worth a total of $625,000, will support Dominy's pioneering study of human evolution. The fellowship is one of the nation's highest honors for young faculty members. Dominy, an assistant professor of anthropology, joined the UCSC faculty in 2004. </p><p>Dominy will receive $125,000 per year for the next five years to support his investigation of the diet and foraging behaviors of hominins, the early human ancestors who lived 2 million years ago. The Packard Foundation awards these fellowships to young scientists and engineers who show exceptional promise and creativity. Dominy is the eighth UCSC faculty member to receive a Packard Fellowship and the first social scientist to be recognized with the honor.</p><p>"Nate Dominy's work at the intersection of anthropology, ecology, and genetics is pushing through disciplinary boundaries and generating keen insights," said UCSC Chancellor George R. Blumenthal. "He works at the frontier of knowledge. I am thrilled to see his contributions acknowledged, and I look forward to following the endeavors this support will make possible." </p><p>Dominy's research interests center around the acquisition and consumption of food, which he believes fueled the development of bipedalism and big brains. Two of his recent studies made headlines around the world in recent months: The first added compelling new evidence to the hypothesis that hominins may have eaten starchy, nutrient-rich underground plant structures, including bulbs and tubers, while the second revealed that humans are uniquely equipped to digest starch. The revelation that humans have many more copies of the salivary amylase gene than any of their ape relatives bolsters the idea that starch was a crucial addition to the diet of early humans, and that natural selection favored individuals who could make more starch-digesting protein.</p><p>Dominy is known as a bold and creative researcher, and the Packard Fellowship will allow him to explore compelling ideas about links between foraging and stature, which he believes have value for the study of human evolution. After years spent observing the foraging behavior of pygmy hunter-gatherers in Africa, Dominy suspects that small stature has been an advantage in the cool, humid rainforest, where dense growth requires constant flexing of the hip and knee and where smaller body size would reduce heat loss. In other words, being small could be an evolutionary asset rather than a detriment.</p><p>"The classic hypothesis is that short stature is the result of poor nutrition, but then you'd expect to see people of short stature in other habitats where the food supply is limited, like the western desert of Australia," said Dominy. "Instead, short stature has arisen multiple times in rain forests, in Indonesia and northern Australia, as well as in Africa. That makes me think something else is going on."</p><p>Dominy will study 11 pygmy populations around the world, including the Mbuti of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Biaka of Cameroon, to study the biomechanics and metabolic costs of locomotion. He will use high-tech tools, including video-based motion analysis, thermographic imaging, and a telemetered heart rate and gas exchange analyzer, in his investigation of why natural selection may have favored short stature in the region. By analyzing DNA gathered in the field, he hopes to learn more about the molecular mechanisms that regulate human stature. The results will shed light on the selective advantages of stature and help estimate the timing of shifts in the evolution of these populations. They will also advance molecular genetics by improving understanding in ways that may generate medical treatments targeting the growth hormone pathway.</p><p>An interdisciplinary scientist, Dominy's long-term goal is to bridge the gaps among evolutionary theory, tropical ecology, and molecular genetics. "It's difficult to find support for this combination of genetics, biomechanics, and tropical ecology, because the gap among these disciplines is large," said Dominy,</p><p>Dominy will pursue the investigation of stature with Erin E. Butler, a biomechanical engineer at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University. </p><p>Additionally, two UCSC graduates were among the 20 fellowship recipients announced today: Andrew D. Jacobson, an assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Northwestern University, earned a bachelor's degree in earth sciences and chemistry in 1996. And Adam C. Siepel, assistant professor of biological statistics and computational biology at Cornell University, earned a Ph.D. in computer science from UCSC in 2005.</p><p>#####</p><p><b>Editor's Note</b>: For additional background on Dominy's research, see:</p><p><a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press_releases/text.asp?pid=1553">press release1</a></p><p><a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press_releases/text.asp?pid=1251">press release2</a></p><p><a href="http://review.ucsc.edu/fall07/text.asp?pid=1631">magazine profile</a></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915375508072704601a012ff45fc94bc"><name>1644</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Discovery of retinal cell type ends four-decade search</title><summary>Researchers have discovered a type of retinal cell that may help monkeys, apes, and humans see motion.</summary><author>Hugh Powell (831) 459-2495, hpowell@ucsc.edu; Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495, stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Alan Litke, retina</keywords><description>Researchers have discovered a type of retinal cell that may help monkeys, apes, and humans see motion.</description><start-date>1191999600000</start-date><display-name>Discovery of retinal cell...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1644</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1644</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338419957</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338419957</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/10/images/neuroboard_300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/10/images/neuroboard_300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>neuroboard_300.jpg</name><file-size>121959</file-size><width>300</width><height>296</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>A pinhead-size 512-electrode array in the center of this "neuroboard" records the output of retinal neurons.

Litke.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A research team combining high-energy physicists from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and neuroscientists from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif., has discovered a type of retinal cell that may help monkeys, apes, and humans see motion. The team's work appears in the October 10 issue of <em>Journal of Neuroscience.</em></p>
<p>The cell type has very similar properties to so-called Y retinal ganglion cells, which were first described in cats in 1966. Upon the Y-cell's discovery, scientists began a decades-long search for its counterpart in primates. The UCSC-Salk Institute team named the new cell type the upsilon cell, after the Greek uppercase letter written as "Y."</p>
<p>This week's discovery puts scientists one step closer to understanding how primates transform the chaos of light bombarding their eyes into a clear, steady, color picture of the world around them.</p>
<p>"This has been a fantastic journey through high-energy physics, neurobiology, technology, and human health," said senior author Alan Litke, adjunct professor of physics at UCSC's Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP). "We started out developing instruments to look for fundamental particles such as the top quark and the Higgs boson. Then we realized we could apply some of those technological concepts to studying neural systems. Now we are using the new technology for experiments that will help guide the design of future retinal prosthetic devices."</p>
<p>The retina is the paper-thin coating on the back of the eye that turns light into coded messages headed to the brain. The first step in the process is handled by rod and cone cells that transform arriving photons of light into electrical signals. Another three cell layers process those signals and then pass them on to ganglion cells like the Y and upsilon, which are middlemen that collate the signals and send them up the optic nerve to the brain. The eye has only about one retinal ganglion cell for every 100 rod and cone cells. Although biologists have identified at least 22 distinct types of primate retinal ganglion cells, the functions of only about a half-dozen of them are known.</p>
<p>"People have looked at cell morphology, but that can't tell us in any detail how the cell responds to light," Litke said. "If we're interested in how the retina is processing visual information, we really want to focus a movie on it and see what it reacts to--to find out if it's seeing color, responding to motion, or whatever it might be doing."</p>
<p>The upsilon cells went undetected for so long, Litke suggested, mainly because they are only a tiny fraction of all the ganglion cells. This small number makes the cells very difficult to detect with traditional physiological techniques, which typically monitor only one cell or a tiny patch of retina at any one time.</p>
<p>So Litke and his colleagues developed a new detection system inspired by their research detecting particles in high-energy-physics collisions. The device crammed 512 electrodes into an area of 1.7 square millimeters (about the size of a pinhead). Each of the team's experiments, conducted in the Salk Institute lab of neurobiologist E. J. Chichilnisky, recorded the electrical activity of more than 250 cells simultaneously, five to 10 of which were upsilon cells.</p>
<p>"The high density and large number of the electrodes gave us the ability to pick out individual neurons and at the same time examine a whole collection of cells," Litke said. "If you had only a few electrodes, you might detect a single cell with unusual properties, but you wouldn't know what to do with it--it might just be a sick cell. Now we can identify a significant number of these cells in a single preparation, all with the same properties. That gives us confidence in our results."</p>
<p>To figure out how the upsilon cells handle information, the researchers projected simple movies through a microscope lens and onto a patch of retina. As rod and cone cells picked up the images, they sent electrical signals to a wide variety of retinal nerve cells. After picking up the signals on the electrode array, SCIPP postgraduate researcher Dumitru Petrusca matched them with the movie, allowing him to map out the light-sensitive regions of each cell. The team found that the collection of upsilon cells forms a mosaic across the retina, with nearly continuous coverage and very little overlap.</p>
<p>The sensitive regions of upsilon cells measured 300 to 500 microns across, considerably larger than most other retinal ganglion cells (a micron is one-millionth of a meter; 300 microns is about three times the width of a human hair). Upsilon cells showed particular sensitivity to oscillating fields of stripes, the sort of input they might receive when a textured surface moves across their field of view.</p>
<p>Together, these qualities suggest an ability to sense motion. Amid a flood of information heading to the brain, sensitivity to changing patterns would emphasize the parts of the picture that are moving. And the large size of the cell's sensitive region would be better suited to sensing motion than providing pinpoint resolution on a stationary object.</p>
<p>If the upsilon cells prove to be connected to the brain the way cat Y-cells are, then they likely feed their information to two separate processing centers. One, called the lateral geniculate nucleus, is a waystation to the visual cortex. The other, the superior colliculus, helps turn the eyes and the head toward a stimulus. Litke said this would strengthen the suggestion that the upsilon cells help detect motion.</p>
<p>"You see something coming in your peripheral vision, and you turn your head because maybe it's a lion coming to attack you," he said.</p>
<p>With their 512-electrode array, Litke and his colleagues are planning to keep on filling in the blanks of other unknowns. "We're working on many other cell types," Litke said. "This is just the tip of the iceberg."</p>
<p>In addition to Litke, Petrusca, and Chichilnisky, the paper's authors include graduate student Matthew Grivich and assistant researcher Alexander Sher of SCIPP and Greg Field, Jeffrey Gauthier, Martin Greschner, and Jonathon Shlens of the Salk Institute. Critical contributions to the technology development were made by SCIPP researchers Serguei Kachiguine and Alex Grillo, and by Wladyslaw Dabrowski and his integrated circuit design team at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow, Poland.</p>

<p>Renowned for lightning-fast fingers and revolutionary playing techniques, Shimabukuro views the ukulele as an "untapped source of music with unlimited potential." Playing jazz, blues, funk, classical, bluegrass, folk, flamenco, and rock, Shimabukuro's mission is to show that the ukulele is capable of so much more than only the traditional Hawaiian music many associate with it.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old Shimabukuro toured with Jimmy Buffett in 2005, 2006, and 2007 and contributed to the soundtrack of the Buffett-produced film <em>Hoot</em>. He has also toured with Bela Fleck &amp; the Flecktones (2002, 2005, 2006) and recorded on the band's <em>Little Worlds</em> (2003) album, as well as being featured on Ziggy Marley's Grammy Award winning <em>Love is My Religion</em> (2006).</p>
<p>Concerts are held at the Arboretum's Amphitheater Stage; doors open at 5:30 p.m. and the show begins at 6:30 p.m. Tickets are $20 at the gate and $18 in advance and at all times for Arboretum Members. Tickets may be purchased now at Norrie's Gift Shop at the Arboretum, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily, and at Logos bookstore in downtown Santa Cruz, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily.</p>
<p>Tickets also available by phone, (831) 427-2998, Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. (NOTE: If you do not get a live person on the phone, call back.

The dean selects recipients from a list of recommendations compiled by a faculty committee based on nominations put forth by department chairs. The committee, chaired by politics professor Daniel Wirls, consisted of environmental studies professor Daniel Press, sociology professor Andrew Szasz, and associate professor of psychology Heather Bullock. </p><p>In addition, the following awards were also presented during the convocation:</p><p>. Psychology professor Bruce Bridgeman is the first recipient of the Martin M. Chemers Award for Outstanding Research in the Division of Social Sciences. New this year, the award recognizes a senior faculty member who has made a major impact on her or his discipline through research and publications. Bridgeman, who studies vision and perception, received a plaque and a check for $2,500.</p><p>. Graduate students Monika Thomas of economics and Florencia Marchetti of community studies each received the 2007 Milan-McGinty-Kaun Award for Distinguished Teaching. The recipients were presented with their awards by David Kaun, the professor of economics who funded the award to recognize outstanding teaching by graduate students. The award is named after its first recipients, Garrett Milam and Matt McGinty, who inspired Kaun to endow the award when they were students in UCSC's doctoral program in international economics. Thomas and Marchetti each received $1,000.</p><p>. Staff members Garfield Byrd, chief financial officer at the New Teacher Center, and Gillian McGuire, manager of the Education Department, received the 2007 Social Science Staff Recognition Awards. Each recipient received a plaque and a check for $1,500 in recognition of their outstanding service to the Division of Social Sciences and to UCSC. </p><p>Finally, four student recipients of 2007 Community Studies Walsh Scholarships were announced: Liza Sawyer of Aptos; Julie Thatsophone of San Pablo, CA; Sophia Gottlieb of Santa Cruz; and Monica Morales of Burlingame, CA. Each student received a $500 scholarship.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91537ce58072704601a012ff920736ec"><name>1651</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Slug swim team braves cold, jellies in eighth annual bay crossing</title><summary>Neither jellyfish nor sharks nor the stinging-cold waters of the Monterey Bay deterred the UC Santa Cruz swim team from spending a recent Sunday completing the eighth annual transbay swim--a grueling, 26-mile test of endurance the team does to raise funds</summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-5312; gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>UC Santa Cruz swim team, transbay, Ian Carney</keywords><description>Neither jellyfish nor sharks nor the stinging-cold waters of the Monterey Bay deterred the UC Santa Cruz swim team from spending a recent Sunday completing the eighth annual transbay swim--a grueling, 26-mile test of endurance the team does to raise funds</description><start-date>1192172400000</start-date><display-name>Slug swim team braves...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1651</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1651</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338421928</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338421928</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/10/images/swim_finish.320.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/10/images/swim_finish.320.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>swim_finish.320.jpg</name><file-size>18367</file-size><width>320</width><height>203</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Members of the UCSC swim team exit the water in Monterey after completing a 26-mile transbay relay swim.

But the event has also become a remembrance for the late UCSC swimmer Ian Carney, who competed with UC Santa Cruz from 2002 to 2004. Carney participated in the transbay swim all three years he was on the team. He died in a glissading accident on Mount Tallac in Lake Tahoe in 2004. He was 20. </p><p>Carney was "one of those kids who didn't have any fear about trying stuff," said UCSC swim coach Kim Musch.</p><p>That spirit came through during the swim, in which 12 hearty members of the team swam in two relay teams, taking individual 20-minute intervals from Santa Cruz to Monterey. They gathered on the cold sand of Seabright Beach before dawn and started as first light peeked over the Santa Cruz Mountains. The first team finished in 10 hours, 30 minutes; the second team finished in 11 hours, 13 minutes, according to Musch. The rest of the swim team--which consists of 60 members total, as well as seven divers--was waiting to greet the transbay swimmers on the beach in Monterey. </p><p>The water temperature hovered between 50 and 51 degrees. They encountered some serious wind chop and some serious jellyfish. Payam Saljoughian, one of the team captains, was stung on his left arm by one of what he said were "hundreds" of jellies that make their home in the bay. </p><p>The sting shocked Saljoughian more than it actually hurt, he said. But the cold was a constant factor. </p><p>"When you dove in, you lost sense of direction and gravity--it was overwhelming," said Saljoughian. "But as our bodies warmed up, we got more accustomed to it."</p><p>For safety, the swimmers were surrounded by three other swim team members paddling kayaks. There were also two support boats, where each swimmer could rest and warm up between swimming shifts. </p><p>Getting out of the water and onto the boat was the hardest "because you were shivering so much," Saljoughian said.</p><p>You realize you're on your own when you're way out there, said Musch. The feeling may be a bit spooky, but the sunrises and the sea life make the journey worthwhile, he said. </p><p>"We've seen whales, seals, otters, sunfish, and blue sharks," he said. </p><p>What about--gulp--the "man in the gray suit"?</p><p>"We've never seen any great whites," said Musch. "But two humpbacks trailed one of the boats last time. You hear them breathing first before you see them." </p><p>Getting a spot on the transbay team is a coveted position. Seniors get first dibs, then juniors, then sophomores, said Musch. </p><p>"But we generally don't get any freshmen or sophomores who get to swim. They haggle over it," said Musch.

The artificially intelligent pieces of art are the work of Michael Mateas, assistant professor of computer science at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Mateas and five other programmer-artists are featured in an ongoing exhibition titled <em>Grand Text Auto</em>, named for their collective blog about video games and art. Their work is on display through December 15 at UC Irvine's Beall Center for Art and Technology.</p>
<p>The name is a twist on <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>--perhaps the archetypal blood-guns-and-crime video game. But the artwork on show is far removed from anything you might see on a Sony PlayStation. Mateas's work attempts to build expressiveness into artificial intelligence, or AI. He writes programs capable of inspiring empathy, then uses them to study how people regard machines. He also strives to make the projects look cool.</p>
<p>"Each piece is simultaneously a research project, where we're doing AI research and user experience research, and it's an art piece," Mateas said. "My goal is that every piece is worthy of being shown in a gallery."</p>
<p>Mateas is the co-creator of <em>FaÃ§ade,</em> a video-game melodrama structured as a 20-minute, one-act play. The game, on display at the exhibition, thrusts the player into an awkward evening at the apartment of a bickering couple. The player's participation can determine the fate of the couple's relationship.</p>
<p>He or she can try to smooth things over, egg the couple on, or nervously change the subject. The game understands each comment and advances the story by choosing an appropriate snippet of dialog from five hours of pre-recorded possibilities. To make it work, Mateas and collaborator Andrew Stern spent five years inventing a new programming language and teaching the computer a rudimentary understanding of English.</p>
<p>Also on display is <em>AR FaÃ§ade,</em> an "augmented reality" version of the game, which is played on an actual set of the couple's apartment. The player wears special goggles that superimpose 3-D versions of the couple on the scene, allowing all three characters to move around at will.</p>
<p>"In a sense the impetus for <em>AR FaÃ§ade</em> was like, 'How close can we get to the Holodeck?'" Mateas said, referring to the holographic rec room that was a staple on <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation.</em> "And we already had the AI part of that in FaÃ§ade, so let's see if we can actually extend this out into the physical world."</p>
<p>But <em>FaÃ§ade</em> and <em>AR FaÃ§ade</em> aren't just 20-minute amusements. They've also led Mateas to some unexpected research insights. He found that the more-realistic characters of <em>AR FaÃ§ade</em> forced some players toward social norms, making them reluctant to try out off-the-wall behavior. And many players preferred typing their words in <em>FaÃ§ade</em> to speaking them in <em>AR FaÃ§ade.</em></p>
<p>"Having the computer you can talk to is one of these holy grails, and it's usually just sort of an untested assumption that, of course, speaking is going to be better than typing," Mateas said. "Typing is just sort of this interim step--we have to put up with these keyboards before we finally have a computer that can listen to us. Well, actually, typing has some positive features. When you're speaking, as soon as it's out of your mouth it's out of your mouth."</p>
<p>Mateas's other projects in the exhibit include <em>Terminal Time,</em> a 30-minute documentary of the past millennium that edits itself in response to audience feedback. The result is a version of history tailored to the audience's particular biases. Also on display will be <em>Tableau Machine,</em> a program that turns patterns of human activity into abstract art. Mateas and his collaborators designed the piece to hang in the home, where it would provide an alien perspective on ordinary life.</p>
<p>"It almost becomes an alien member of the family," Mateas said. "It becomes sort of like this alien dog, basically, that communicates via creating these abstract compositions."</p>
<p>The <em>Tableau Machine</em> uses four cameras to monitor its surroundings. A program dissects the images and assesses activity in terms of energy, density, and flow. At first, the machine represents the activity with vaguely mechanical shapes like circles, bulls-eyes, and pulleys. As time goes by, the program learns to recognize characteristic patterns of activity and refines the elements into a distinct style of composition for each activity.</p>
<p>Mateas programmed the system to understand basic tenets of composition, but steered away from giving the machine too much artistic advice. "The idea is not to build AI systems that replicate what human beings do, but that have their own kind of idiosyncratic subjectivity," he said. "Then they reflect that alien understanding back to people."</p>
<p>Completing the circle, Mateas has a research project under way in which a family lives with <em>Tableau Machine</em> for six weeks. Through periodic interviews, the family members report their impressions of what the machine has been trying to say about them.</p>
<p>The exhibition also features works from Grand Text Auto's five other contributors. Among them, <em>[giantJoystick]</em> is a fully functional, 10-foot-tall Atari joystick, so massive that it takes two people to control. Exhibit attendees can take turns playing a variety of vintage Atari games, including <em>Space Invaders</em> and <em>Yar's Revenge.</em></p>

<p>In a piece called <em>Screen,</em> text appears on three walls of a darkened room. As the player reads the text, words appear to peel off the wall and then abruptly fly toward the viewer, who must swat the words aside before the whole passage collapses onto the floor.</p>
<p>The Donald R. and Joan F. Beall Center for Art and Technology opened in 2000 with the intention of melding technology with the museum experience. Exhibits often focus on applying digital technology to the tasks of creating art and forging new relationships between art and the sciences.</p>
<p>In addition to Mateas, the five exhibitors are Noah Wardrip-Fruin of UC San Diego; Mary Flanagan of Hunter College, New York; Nick Montfort of M.I.T.; Scott Rettberg of the University of Bergen, Norway; and Andrew Stern of Procedural Arts, L.L.C.</p>
<p>In addition to Mateas and Stern, <em>AR FaÃ§ade</em> is the work of Steven Dow, Blair McIntyre, and Manish Mehta. <em>Tableau Machine</em> was created by Mateas, Zach Pousman, Mario Romero, and Adam Smith. <em>Terminal Time</em> is the work of Steffi Domike, Mateas, and Paul Vanouse. <em>[giantJoystick]</em> was created by Flanagan. <em>Screen</em> is the work of Wardrip-Fruin, Josh Carroll, Robert Coover, Shawn Greenlee, Andrew McClain, and Ben Shine.</p>

<p>Shelley Stamp, chair of the UC Santa Cruz Film &amp; Digital Media Department, provides the audio commentary for <em>Where Are My Children?</em> in <em>Treasures III: Social Issues in American Film, 1900-1934</em> (Image Entertainment).</p>
<p><em>Where Are My Children?</em> is a 1916 look at birth control and abortion that was one of the most controversial--and popular--films of that year.</p>
<p>The box set, a new release by the National Film Preservation Foundation (NFPF), showcases films from an era when no issue was deemed too controversial to bring to the silver screen. Prohibition, birth control, race relations, unions, tuberculosis, atheism, police corruption, immigration, homelessness, loan sharking, and the vote for women are just some of the many issues brought to life in the films. They range from Cecil B. De Mille's reformatory expose, <em>The Godless Girl</em>, to a patriotic "striptease" cartoon for war bonds, and the earliest surviving union film.</p>
<p>"In film's first decades, activists from every political stripe used movies to advance their agenda," noted Academy Award-winning director Martin Scorsese, who serves on the NFPF Board of Directors. "These films are an important and fascinating glimpse of history. They changed America and still inspire today."</p>
<p><em>Where Are My Children?</em> was written and directed by Lois Weber, one of silent cinema's most respected filmmakers, and the first and only woman granted membership in the Motion Picture Directors' Association.</p>
<p>Four years ago, Stamp was named one of two 2003 Academy Film Scholars by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The youngest scholar and second woman ever given such an award, she was honored with a $25,000 grant to support research for an upcoming book that will be titled <em>Lois Weber in Early Hollywood</em>. Stamp noted that Weber's career spotlights the importance of activist filmmaking in the early years of the American film industry.</p>
<p>"Weber was a director/screenwriter who made films about social problems in the 1910s," said Stamp. "She took on all of the hot-button issues of the decade, including contraception, capital punishment, drug abuse, religious intolerance, and women's wage equity. Her career flourished during a period when the industry was open to a model of socially engaged cinema. By the '20s, that era was largely gone, as the industry shifted more towards glamour, entertainment, and escapism."</p>
<p>The NFPF is a nonprofit organization created by Congress to help save America's film heritage. The motion pictures in the new box set are all drawn from the preservation work of the country's early film archives: George Eastman House, the Library of Congress, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Archives and the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive.</p>
<p>"Thanks to the efforts of the film archives and the NFPF, Weber's film and all of the other titles in this DVD set can now be seen by a whole new generation of viewers," Stamp said. "Perhaps some will even be inspired to revive Hollywood's tradition of activist cinema."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915382d68072704601a012ff97356208"><name>1655</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>Craig Reinarman wrote an opinion piece for the Washington Post about a drug case before the Supreme Court . . . and more</summary><keywords>UCSC in the news</keywords><description>Craig Reinarman wrote an opinion piece for the Washington Post about a drug case before the Supreme Court . . . and more</description><start-date>1192172400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1655</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1655</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338423462</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338423462</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</em></p>

Stanley Williams, a senior fellow at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories and founding director of HP's Quantum Science Research group, will discuss nanoscale computing in a free public lecture on Thursday, October 25, hosted by UC Santa Cruz's Baskin School of Engineering and Silicon Valley Center. Williams's talk, titled "Computing at the nanoscale will employ different physics and logic operations," will take place at 4 p.m. in the World Room, Building 943, NASA Ames Research Center.</p>
<p>This will be the final event in the Distinguished Lecture Series marking the 10th anniversary of UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering. Williams will describe several new results that have been achieved in the past year by his Quantum Science Research group, which is exploring new electronic-device concepts and logic operations.</p>
<p>According to Williams, as the size of electronic-device components continues to shrink to the scale of a few nanometers, the fundamental physics governing the properties of the electrons is becoming more quantum mechanical. Therefore, present-day circuit designs and concepts that implicitly regard electrons as classical objects are becoming less valid. Eventually, continued increases in computing capacity at fixed cost will require new device and logic concepts that explicitly incorporate quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Established in 1994, the Quantum Science Research group is focused on preparing HP for the challenges and opportunities ahead in electronic, photonic, and mechanical device technology as features continue to shrink to the nanometer scale, where quantum mechanics becomes important.</p>
<p>Williams is one of just five active Senior Fellows at HP. For the past 30 years, his primary scientific research has been in the areas of solid-state chemistry and physics, and their applications to technology. This research has evolved into the areas of nanostructures and chemically assembled materials, with an emphasis on the thermodynamics of size and shape. Most recently, he has examined the fundamental limits of information and computing, which has led to his current research in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics.</p>
<p>Williams has received numerous awards for business, scientific, and academic achievement, including the 2004 Joel Birnbaum Prize (the highest internal HP award for research), the 2003 Herman Bloch Medal for Industrial Research, the 2000 Julius Springer Award for Applied Physics, the 2000 Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology, the Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award, and a Sloan Foundation Fellowship. He was named to the inaugural <em>Scientific American</em> 50 Top Technology leaders in 2002 and then again in 2005 (the first to be so named twice).</p>
<p>Williams has been awarded more than 50 U.S. patents and has published more than 280 papers in reviewed scientific journals. In 2005, <em>Small Times</em> magazine named the U.S. patent collection he has assembled at HP as the world's top nanotechnology intellectual property portfolio.</p>
<p>Williams received a B.A. in chemical physics from Rice University and Ph.D. in physical chemistry from UC Berkeley in 1978. He worked at AT&amp;T Bell Labs from 1978 to 1980 and was a faculty member in the Chemistry Department at UCLA from 1980 to 1995.</p>
<p>Building 943 is located next to the NASA Exploration Center at NASA Ames (see <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/directions.html">directions</a>).</p>

<p>In all, the campus will be closed for eleven days of which four days are scheduled holidays (December 24, 25, 31, 2007, and January 1, 2008), four days are weekend days, and three (December 26, 27 and 28, 2007) are campus closure days.</p>
<p>The closure may result in employees being required to use vacation, accrued compensatory time off, or leave without pay for the three days of December 26, 27 and 28, 2007. Employees without sufficient accumulated vacation will be allowed to use up to three days of vacation leave prior to actual accrual. Employees normally required to wait six months before using accrued vacation will be allowed to use vacation even if the required waiting period hasn't been completed.</p>
<p>Due to the diverse responsibilities of academic appointees and the flexibility in performing their obligations, it is anticipated that some academic appointees will continue working during campus closure. Fiscal-year appointees will be expected to use vacation for this period, if the closure precludes their working.</p>
<p>Units planning to maintain operations as usual during the campus closure period should refer to the "Exceptions to Campus Closure" memo that will be forthcoming in November 2007. This memo will explain the required procedure to ensure that heat is supplied to appropriate working areas.</p>

Who are the "Cave People" at the Santa Cruz Boardwalk? Why were two giant white stone cats erected by Highway 17 in Los Gatos? What is the real story behind the Greco-Roman-style Pulgas Water Temple built on the San Francisco Peninsula?</p><p>These questions and more are revealed in <i>Local Girl Makes History: Exploring California's Kitsch Monuments</i>, a new book by UC Santa Cruz historian Dana Frank. Blending investigative reporting, historical analysis, and personal anecdotes--along with multiple plot twists and surprises--Frank focuses on four landmark Northern California sites to reflect on the culture and politics of history. </p><p>As Frank notes in the book's preface:  "This is not your usual local history book...it's about the unexpected ways in which larger historical politics are embedded in the landscapes of everyday life."</p><p>The seed for the book was first sown in 1991 when Frank--who grew up in Los Altos--returned to Northern California to teach at UCSC after a decade spent in the East and Midwest. She began imagining writing little essays about the sites for local papers, carrying around these ideas in her head for nearly a decade before deciding to investigate further and pursue a book. </p><p>"I started thinking about looking at some of my favorite childhood landmarks with a new lens--not only as an adult, but also as a historian with an understanding of the cultural and political context from which they had emerged," said Frank.</p><p>Frank begins the book by revisiting a slice of an ancient redwood tree on display at Big Basin Redwood Park. She wonders why the little metal markers by the tree's growth rings--indicating dates of various world events--all refer to conquests and invasions. As she uncovers more information, Frank discovers why the north coast is often referred to as the Redwood Empire.</p><p>She then moves on to an exposé of the two bohemian poets who in the 1920s built two 20-foot-tall, Sphinx-like stone cats on the side of Highway 17, marking the entry to a mysterious road leading into the hills. After a chance encounter with someone working on her house, Frank sets out to explore the lives of the poets who lived behind the cats, and their relationship with their Italian immigrant servants.</p><p>"It was amazing to hear the difference between accounts by the servants and their masters," said Frank. "In their diaries, the two poets describe the servants as happy, loyal members of the family. But when I interviewed the granddaughter  of one of the servants, she told me that 'they nearly worked my grandmother to death.' "</p><p>Frank also makes fascinating discoveries about the Pulgas Water Temple, located at the point where the city of San Francisco's water supply flows into Crystal Springs Reservoir after passing through dams, pipes and tunnels from Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy Valley. She learns that it was built as a public relations device--a stage and symbol for a huge press conference that took place in 1934 on the day the waters first flowed--where Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes gave a nationally broadcast radio speech. </p><p>Frank said that when she began her research for the book, she had no idea where her investigations would lead; she just wanted to see what each story would discover and take the reader with her. </p><p>"I didn't have a clue that the Pulgas Water Temple was a political ploy," said Frank. "I just wanted to explore where historical knowledge shades over into mythical imagination. It illustrates how malleable the historical record is."</p><p>							</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91538ce28072704601a012ffca6a6540"><name>1662</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Small-scale fishing in Mexico rivals industrial fisheries in accidental turtle deaths</title><summary>New research shows that a small-scale Mexican fishery--operated by hand from small open boats--can kill as many critically endangered loggerhead sea turtles as all of the industrial fishing fleets in the North Pacific Ocean put together.</summary><author>Hugh Powell (831) 459-2495, hpowell@ucsc.edu; Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495, stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Hoyt Peckham, loggerhead turtles</keywords><description>New research shows that a small-scale Mexican fishery--operated by hand from small open boats--can kill as many critically endangered loggerhead sea turtles as all of the industrial fishing fleets in the North Pacific Ocean put together.</description><start-date>1192604400000</start-date><display-name>Small-scale fishing in Mexico...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1662</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1662</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338426027</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338426027</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/10/images/hooked.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/10/images/hooked.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hooked.jpg</name><file-size>68639</file-size><width>250</width><height>276</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Longlines set by Mexican fishermen inadvertently hooked large numbers of loggerhead turtles.

Peckham.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Industrial fishing operations take plenty of blame for both depleting fish stocks and inadvertently catching innocent bystanders such as dolphins, sharks, seabirds, and sea turtles--a phenomenon known as "bycatch."</p>
<p>But new research shows that a small-scale Mexican fishery--operated by hand from small open boats--can kill as many critically endangered loggerhead sea turtles as all of the industrial fishing fleets in the North Pacific Ocean put together. On a per-hook or per-net basis, the Mexican fishery is 10 to 100 times as deadly, the study found. The research has already resulted in a voluntary turnaround in the fleet's fishing practices and the declaration of an offshore turtle refuge.</p>
<p>"The impacts of small-scale fisheries have been overlooked because they are inherently difficult to study," said lead author Hoyt Peckham, a Ph.D. candidate in ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Peckham and colleagues worked alongside Mexican fishermen to simultaneously measure and reduce the accidental turtle catches. Their findings suggest that small fishing operations, which are ubiquitous along coastlines the world over, can have drastic, unintended effects on ocean wildlife such as sea turtles. The work appears in the October 17 edition of the online, open-access journal <em>PLoS ONE.</em></p>
<p>"It was really surprising to me, because when I think of bycatch I think of massive factory trawlers with huge catch rates decimating the oceans," Peckham said. "What's striking in this work is that some small-scale fleets can kill many more turtles, because they fish where turtles are most abundant."</p>
<p>One such place is off the coast of Baja California Sur, Mexico, where perennially rich turtle feeding waters overlap with a small patch of favored fishing grounds. Local fishermen ply these waters for halibut and other bottom-dwelling fish using gill nets and strings of hooks known as longlines. Their <em>pangas</em>--small boats around 20 feet long--usually fish within about 3 miles of shore, where there are few turtles. But when the fishermen venture farther offshore they share the water with thousands of turtles that spend decades fattening up on the abundant food.</p>
<p>Many turtles are snared inadvertently. Peckham and his coworkers estimated the bycatch at more than 1,000 turtles per year based on their observations accompanying fishermen on day trips and surveying local beaches for washed-up turtle carcasses. Bycatch happens so commonly, Peckham said, that many locals at first didn't even realize the turtles were endangered.</p>
<p>By comparison, U.S. officials are so concerned about loggerhead turtles that in 2002 they shut down Hawaii's 20-boat, $55 million swordfish fleet to develop ways to avoid bycatch. The fishery reopened three years later but included an automatic cap that shuts down the season if the fleet as a whole hooks more than 17 turtles. In 2006, the cap was reached just three months into the 10-month season, Peckham said.</p>
<p>Loggerheads are medium-sized sea turtles whose shells reach about a meter (3.3 feet) in length. They live for 50 years or more and nest on beaches in many parts of the world, including the southeastern U.S., the Mediterranean, Oman, Australia, and Japan.</p>
<p>North Pacific loggerheads nest exclusively in Japan, where records from the past 50 years show they are plunging toward extinction. At some nesting beaches, numbers have dropped 50 percent to 90 percent in the last decade. Fewer than 1,500 adult females are thought to nest each year in the entire North Pacific, according to Peckham.</p>
<p>But in addition to those adults, there are many thousand adolescent turtles that spend several decades roaming the North Pacific--and feeding in the waters off Baja California--before beginning to breed. Losing 1,000 or more per year in Mexican waters alone is likely to put a dent in breeding numbers that will be felt decades into the future.</p>
<p>"You can protect hatchlings on beaches all you want, but if you don't protect juveniles during those 30 years on their foraging habitats, it's never going to work," Peckham said.</p>
<p>After realizing the scale of the bycatch, Peckham planned his dissertation research in a way that would help solve the problem. Through the regional conservation network Grupo Tortuguero, he employed Mexican high school and university students to go out on fishing boats and record turtle catches. He set up meetings with local fishermen to brainstorm ways to avoid the problem, including testing alternative fishing gear, bringing Japanese and Hawaiian fishermen to Mexico to share oceanwide perspectives, and spreading the word about bycatch through comic books, impromptu movie showings, murals, and festivals. (See <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1597">related story</a>.)</p>
<p>After seeing the global consequences of their activities, the fishermen quickly made strides to curb their fleet's impact. Last year, a traditionally rich fishing locale that also produced much of the turtle bycatch was voluntarily made into an off-limits "Fishers' Turtle Reserve" by the fishermen themselves. Efforts to declare the area an official national reserve with legal protection are under way. And earlier this year, Peckham said, the owner of the area's biggest fishing fleet chose to retire his longlines from duty in turtle-rich waters.</p>
<p>"In the realm of saving ocean wildlife, we rarely see opportunities as powerful as this," said Wallace J. Nichols of the Ocean Conservancy, a coauthor of the paper.</p>
<p>"These Mexican fishermen are bringing about probably the biggest reduction in bycatch by any single action that we can imagine. That fleet's switch away from bottom-set longlines will spare hundreds of loggerheads a year," Peckham said.</p>
<p>In addition to Peckham and Nichols, the study's authors include David Maldonado Diaz and Georgita Ruiz of Grupo Tortuguero A. C., and Larry B. Crowder of Duke University.</p>
<p>Peckham directed the conservation side of his research through Grupo Tortuguero with support from foundations and agencies including the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Japan Foundation, and the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service.</p>

Its objectives are to collect and preserve natural specimens from throughout the country and to organize exhibits that promote a better understanding of the nature and environment of Ho Chi Minh City and the country of Vietnam. The San Francisco-Ho Chi Minh Sister City Committee is among the cooperating organizations involved in the project.</p><p>At the conference, Harder presented ideas for the development and design of the museum's botanical garden, herbarium collections, and educational exhibits and outreach associated with the botanical side of the museum. Other participants included experts from the Smithsonian Institution, the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, and the Cologne Zoo in Germany.  </p><p>"It was a wonderful opportunity for me to connect to Vietnam's first effort to develop a natural history museum and take part in the historical process of planning this new museum," Harder said. "Public education about Vietnam's rich biodiversity and its endangerment is a key first step to developing a stronger conservation ethic within Vietnam and raising global awareness of the threats to this rich floristic region."</p><p>Before coming to UCSC, Harder spent several years in Vietnam as founding director of a botanical conservation program for the Missouri Botanical Garden. Working with Vietnamese botanist Nguyen Tien Hiep and other collaborators, his team has added about 10 percent to the total number of species known from Vietnam. Included in their findings were new species of orchids, begonias, and conifers, including the rare golden Vietnamese cypress (see <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/01-02/01-14/conifer.html">earlier story</a>).</p><p>During the recent conference, Harder and other attendees enjoyed field trips to the mangrove swamps at Con Gio in the Mekong Delta and to the diverse myrtle forests of Nam Cat Tien National Park. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915390978072704601a012ff0f4a9f6f"><name>1665</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Join the Women at Work Retreat planning effort</title><summary>The Women at Work Retreat planning team is looking for volunteers to help with fundraising and serve on planning committees.</summary><keywords>Women at Work Retreat</keywords><description>The Women at Work Retreat planning team is looking for volunteers to help with fundraising and serve on planning committees.</description><start-date>1192604400000</start-date><display-name>Join the Women at...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1665</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1665</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338426975</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338426975</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/10/images/women.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/10/images/women.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>women.300.jpg</name><file-size>66213</file-size><width>300</width><height>217</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The annual two-day Women at Work Retreat provides a relaxing setting for campus staff to get to know one another.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Women at Work Retreat planning committee has put out the call for volunteers.</p>
<p>Every spring the staff organization Women at Work puts on a two-day off-campus retreat organized for and by staff women. The event, in its 22nd year this spring, is sponsored by the UCSC Women's Center, Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action, and Staff HR. Campus units also provide funding for their staff to attend. Since 1992, a significant portion of the retreat budget has been generated by the fundraising activities of Women at Work.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to get involved in the 2008 retreat. One way is by participating in activities that raise money for partial scholarships for women who would like to attend the retreat but who do not receive full sponsorship from their units. These activities include:</p>

<p>The "Building a Culture of Collaboration" resource centers cluster fair featured speakers including Chancellor George Blumenthal and Paul Ortiz, associate professor of community studies; skits; roundtable discussions; and workshops.</p>
<p>The aim of the event was to increase collaboration between the resource centers and the campus as a way to support the university's intersecting student populations. It was also meant to increase the centers' visibility.</p>
<p>"Collaboration is a key part of UC Santa Cruz," said Blumenthal in his remarks to the event participants. "Much of the work we do here is collaborative in one form or another."</p>
<p>The campus cares about issues of diversity and inclusiveness and wants to improve in those areas, said Blumenthal. To that end, he said he planned to establish a Chancellor's Council on Diversity, representing faculty, staff, students, and others.</p>
<p>Diversity on campus is more than just a moral obligation, said keynote speaker Ortiz.</p>
<p>"Supporting diversity in a research university is important not because it's the right thing to do," said Ortiz, "but because it's the only way we can fulfill our charter to serve the people of California."</p>
<p>The resource centers that organized the event were the African American Resource and Cultural Center, the American Indian Resource Center, the Asian American/Pacific Islander Resource Center, the Chicano/Latino Resource Center, the Cultural Arts &amp; Diversity Center, the Lionel CantÃº Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex Resource Center, and the Women's Center.</p>

"They are being marketed as 'recreational,' but many consumers do not take these tests lightly."</p><p>The tests raise serious questions about how societies define race, and they can have profound impacts in terms of personal identity and the allocation of resources, said Reardon.</p><p>Consumers have varied and often deeply personal reasons for taking the tests, which typically cost between $100 and $900, according to the authors. Some hope to validate genealogical records, fill in gaps in family histories, or find connections to specific groups or places, while others have used the tests in hopes of tracing ancestral links lost during the slave trade or to establish Native American tribal affiliations, or challenge tribal membership decisions. Since 2001, more than 460,000 people have purchased the tests.</p><p>"Not all the companies that market these tests spell out their limitations, yet the results can have serious consequences," said Reardon, the author of <i>Race to the Finish: Identity and Governance in an Age of Genomics</i> (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2005). Based on genetic test results, people have relocated and made other major life-changing decisions, said Reardon.</p><p>The coauthors argue that the assumptions and limitations of the tests make them less informative than many realize, and commercialization has led to misleading practices that reinforce misconceptions. The authors call upon the scientific community to better educate the public about the limitations of the tests and to develop policy statements that make clear the limitations and potential dangers of genetic ancestry testing.</p><p> </p><p>Some of the tests' limitations discussed in the article include:</p><p>. Most tests analyze only a small portion of an individual's DNA and trace only a fraction of an individual's ancestry;</p><p>. Test results are based on incomplete databases of samples gathered around the world; as databases grow, results are likely to change over time;</p><p>. Most companies consider results proprietary, which hampers public access to the broadest-possible database that would yield the most comprehensive findings;</p><p>. There is no clear-cut connection between DNA and racial/ethnic identity.</p><p>"Because these tests are purportedly scientific, they suggest that race is a biological issue that can be determined by looking at genes," said Reardon. "However, if someone who considers herself white takes a test that suggests she is of 10-percent African ancestry, does that make her African American? How should she report her race on governmental forms or college and job applications? Genetic ancestry testing raises bigger issues about how we define race, and those issues need to be on the table."</p><p>"These tests are not recreational at all," said Reardon. "They require greater scrutiny and oversight before being sold to the public."</p><p>#####</p><p><b>Note to reporters</b>: Reardon can be reached via e-mail at reardon1@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9153965e8072704601a012ff8197f266"><name>1669</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Salaries, parking, child care are topics for Blumenthal at fall staff brown bag</title><summary>Chancellor George Blumenthal updated staff on a number of ongoing campus issues and answered questions about salaries and benefits, parking costs, and child care in his first staff brown bag forum as permanent chancellor October 17.</summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-5312; gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Chancellor George Blumenthal, staff brown bag forum, Staff Advisory Board</keywords><description>Chancellor George Blumenthal updated staff on a number of ongoing campus issues and answered questions about salaries and benefits, parking costs, and child care in his first staff brown bag forum as permanent chancellor October 17.</description><start-date>1192777200000</start-date><display-name>Salaries, parking, child care...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1669</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1669</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338428421</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338428421</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Chancellor George Blumenthal updated staff on a number of ongoing campus issues and answered questions about salaries and benefits, parking costs, and child care in his first staff brown bag forum as permanent chancellor October 17.</p><p>Blumenthal opened his remarks by encouraging UC Santa Cruz staff to apply for the position of staff advisor to the Regents, saying it was time UCSC had a larger voice with the board.</p><p>The Staff Advisor program is meant to improve direct communication between UC employees and the Board of Regents and to help staff make input into the board's deliberations and decisions.</p><p>On the university's environmental study of its long-range growth plan, Blumenthal said he hopes the university, the City of Santa Cruz, and others can solve their differences through resolution and discussion rather than continuing legal action. </p><p>The university is in talks with the city and the other involved parties, said Blumenthal.</p><p>"Our responsibility as public servants is to find a way to solve these disputes," he said.</p><p>Blumenthal spoke for about 15 minutes and answered questions for an hour. The majority of questions centered on salaries and benefits, with several members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), the public employee and health care workers union, inquiring about parity issues and a timetable for step raises.</p><p>"It's important we try to raise the salary of all workers to appropriate levels," said Blumenthal in response. "Everyone at UC is underpaid. It's an endemic problem for UC."</p><p>But, he said, custodial employees got raises retroactively from money set aside last year.</p><p>"I argue I've already made a commitment to you with real money," Blumenthal said.</p><p>That said, Blumenthal repeatedly stated that all pay levels at the university require review.</p><p> "I'm a strong supporter of moving all salaries to the market rate," he said.</p><p>Parking costs, however, will remain the same for the time being. One questioner asked about the potential for tiered parking costs dependent on salary level.</p><p>"Right now, the policy is everyone pays the same," said Blumenthal. As for future increases in parking fees, he said, "I don't want to see parking fees go up, but I also feel an obligation to act responsibly."</p><p>Another query, asked anonymously via e-mail, questioned Blumenthal about the state of UCSC's child care, saying the system is "broken" and asking how the chancellor would address the problems.</p><p>"There are real problems now," he admitted, referring to the Granary Child Development Center. "We need to make sure we can operate that facility safely."</p><p>UCSC has taken action with personnel changes, a new coordinator, staff training and plans to increase the number of staff members.</p><p>About 300 staff members attended the brown bag forum, organized by the Staff Advisory Board and held at the Stevenson Event Center. The forum was available as a live audio webcast for campus staff unable to attend. It has been archived and is also available for listening or downloading on the <a href="http://sab.ucsc.edu">Staff Advisory Board Web site</a>.</p><p>Blumenthal invited staff to communicate with him via e-mail, saying he reads everything sent to <a href="mailto:chancellor@ucsc.edu">chancellor@ucsc.edu</a>, though he may not answer every email. Also, he conducts office hours people can sign up for.</p><p>Or, he said, just find him on campus. It's not a hard task, he joked: "I'm the only person wearing a tie."</p><p>The next brown bag is scheduled for noon to 1:15 p.m. February 20, 2008. The location is to be determined.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915397908072704601a012ff9e747539"><name>1670</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz economists discuss global capital markets during free public workshop Nov. 9 at NASA Research Park</title><summary>Four economists will discuss the implications of turmoil in global capital markets, during a free public workshop Nov. 9 at UCSC's Silicon Valley Center.</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-4399; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>economics, global capital, workshop</keywords><description>Four economists will discuss the implications of turmoil in global capital markets, during a free public workshop Nov. 9 at UCSC's Silicon Valley Center.</description><start-date>1192777200000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz economists...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1670</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1670</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338428759</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338428759</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Economics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>With global financial markets more interdependent than ever before, economists and financial managers are keeping a close eye on developments. On Friday, November 9, leading economists from the University of California, Santa Cruz, will be joined by top practitioners and analysts from the financial sector for a candid discussion of the implications of turmoil in global capital markets.</p><p>The public workshop, "Rough Seas for Global Capital Markets: Implications for India, China, and the United States," will take place from noon to 5 p.m. in the Eagle Room, Building 943, at NASA Research Park, Moffett Field. Admission is free and lunch will be served, but advance registration is required by Oct. 28. For more information and to register, visit <a href="http://cgirs.ucsc.edu/globalcapitalmarkets.html">more info</a>.</p><p>"The spillover of the U.S. subprime crisis to Europe and Asia highlights the possible vulnerability of global financial markets," said Nirvikar Singh, professor of economics at UCSC and organizer of the workshop. "We have to ask ourselves if the global prosperity of the past 20 years is eroding, and if so, what does it mean for three of the world's major and emerging economic powers?"</p><p>The workshop consists of two panel discussions on the state of global capital markets. The first session features UCSC economics faculty members Joshua Aizenman, Michael Dooley, and Michael Hutchison; it will be chaired by Carl Walsh, also a professor of economics at UCSC.

"The founders set out to create a distinctive and innovative campus in a spectacular setting."</p><p>Donna Murphy, vice chancellor of university relations, noted that it was 50 years ago--October 1957--that the UC regents voted to establish three new campuses to accommodate the expected surge of university students in the 1960s, '70s and '80s. Four years later, the regents selected the historic Cowell Ranch in Santa Cruz for one of those campuses. (The others were in San Diego and Irvine.)</p><p> </p><p>Four years after that--1965--Cowell College opened with some 650 students.</p><p>Founders Day attendees included pioneer faculty, staff and students, along with community members and government and business leaders. They viewed <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/founders/">video presentations highlighting the achievements of the evening's honorees</a>--Dr. Gary Heit, Professor Stanford Woosley, U.S. Rep. Sam Farr and his family, and Chancellor Emeritus Robert Sinsheimer. </p><p>Heit, a 1977 Oakes College graduate, received the Alumni Achievement Award presented by the UCSC Alumni Association for his development of deep brain stimulation, a treatment for neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and chronic pain.</p><p>Woosley was honored as the Faculty Research Lecturer, selected by members of the Academic Senate for his pioneering work in understanding the end-stage evolution of massive stars. He promised an "explosive" presentation at the lecture scheduled for February 12, 2008.</p><p>The Farr Family of Carmel was given the Fiat Lux Award, presented by the UC Santa Cruz Foundation for its role in shaping and strengthening the UCSC campus. </p><p>In accepting the award on behalf of his family, Sam Farr recalled his father Fred Farr's "passion for higher education." For my father, it was not just about power, it was about empowerment," he said.  Referring to the motto "Fiat Lux"--let there be light--Farr said, "all along the way I followed his path and the light that led the way."</p><p>Fred Farr was an attorney, environmentalist and state senator. He was a tireless champion of UCSC and served as a UC Santa Cruz Foundation Board trustee from 1983 until his death at age 86 in 1997. Sam Farr provided key support the Center for Agroecology and </p><p>Sustainable Food Systems and the Monterey Bay Education, Science and Technology Center (MBEST) at Fort Ord.</p><p>Robert Sinsheimer, Chancellor Emeritus, received the Foundation Medal in honor of his significant breakthroughs in the field of genetic research by artificially creating functional strands of DNA. Sinsheimer served as UCSC's fourth chancellor from 1977 to 1987.  "This is an award not only to me but to the many people at UC Santa Cruz," Sinsheimer said. </p><p>Blumenthal congratulated the winners. "Each of these individuals and the entire Farr family has put into action the vision and promise of UC Santa Cruz's founders," he said. </p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91539c678072704601a012ffbda254d4"><name>1675</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Regional History Project publishes oral histories of two visionary UCSC professors</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1193209200000</start-date><display-name>Regional History Project publishes...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1675</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1675</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338429975</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338429975</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Library</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/10/images/haraway_and_cayenne.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/10/images/haraway_and_cayenne.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>haraway_and_cayenne.250.jpg</name><file-size>49346</file-size><width>250</width><height>166</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Donna Haraway with her dog Cayenne (photo by Rusten Hogness)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/10/images/pepper_commencement_circa1980.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/10/images/pepper_commencement_circa1980.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pepper_commencement_circa1980.250.jpg</name><file-size>32207</file-size><width>250</width><height>151</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Jim Pepper, speaking at commencement (circa 1980) </image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Library's Regional History Project has just announced the publication of two new oral histories featuring visionary professors who have helped shape the academic development of the campus. </p><p>The first volume, <i>Edges and Ecotones: The Worlds of Donna Haraway at UCSC</i>, spotlights one of UCSC's preeminent multi-disciplinary thinkers. A professor of history of consciousness and women's studies at UCSC since 1980, Haraway helped build both departments over the past 27 years and is considered one of the country's leading scholars in feminist theory, animal studies, philosophy, and technoscience. </p><p>Haraway received the J. D. Bernal Prize in 2000, a lifetime achievement award from the Society for Social Studies in Science. Her archive is housed at Special Collections in UCSC's McHenry Library, and the new oral history illuminates many of those materials. </p><p></p><p>The second publication, <i>Jim Pepper: The Evolution of Environmental Studies at UC Santa Cruz</i>, is part of the Regional History Project's continuing series of interviews with prominent UCSC professors who retired in the early 1990s. Between his arrival in 1972 and his retirement in 1994, Pepper helped to build a flagship program in environmental studies at the campus.</p><p>Pepper brought to UCSC's new program his practical experience and background as a professional landscape architect and planner, as well as his probing interest in the philosophical and ethical questions at the heart of environmental issues. In these two interviews, conducted by former Regional History director Randall Jarrell and current director Irene Reti, Pepper describes UCSC's environmental studies program as one that "had both a theoretical dimension to it and an applied dimension.a program that integrated theory and practice."</p><p>Outside of academia, Pepper has had a 45-year distinguished career in environmental planning, site planning, and urban design. His projects include the formulation of an earthquake recovery plan for downtown Santa Cruz after the Loma Prieta Earthquake of 1989.</p><p>Copies of Pepper's oral history are available on the UCSC Library's web site: <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/haraway.html">library web site</a>, in Special Collections, and in the circulating stacks of McHenry Library, as well as at the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p>Haraway's oral history is available in both full text (PDF) and audio (MP3) on the UCSC Library web site, or through the Library's Cruzcat catalog. Copies of the transcript are also available in Special Collections, the Feminist Studies library, and at the Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley.</p><p>For more information, contact the Regional History Project at (831) 459-2847 or e-mail ihreti@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p><p>						</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91539eb98072704601a012ff57dde060"><name>1676</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Helping the ocean, one bite at a time</title><summary>With the growth of an innovative program created by a pair of UC Santa Cruz graduate students, colored signs on the offerings at the fish counter are helping food shoppers combat what scientists say is one of the world's most pressing issues: the decline </summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-5312; gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>FishWise, Teresa Ish, Shelly Benoit, Sustainable Fishery Advocates, Marc Mangel, bycatch</keywords><description>With the growth of an innovative program created by a pair of UC Santa Cruz graduate students, colored signs on the offerings at the fish counter are helping food shoppers combat what scientists say is one of the world's most pressing issues: the decline </description><start-date>1193036400000</start-date><display-name>Helping the ocean, one...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1676</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1676</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338430580</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338430580</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/10/images/fishwisedisplay.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/10/images/fishwisedisplay.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fishwisedisplay.300.jpg</name><file-size>14225</file-size><width>300</width><height>212</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>FishWise helps seafood consumers make environmentally responsible choices. </image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Red, yellow, and green have long been known to drivers as the primary colors of stop, slow and go. But with the growth of an innovative program created by a UC Santa Cruz alumna and a Ph.D. candidate, the colors have also now become a way for food shoppers to help combat what scientists say is one of the world's most pressing issues: the decline of the oceans' health.</p><p>FishWise, developed by Teresa Ish and Shelly Benoit, is a color-coded system aimed at helping consumers easily identify sustainable seafood choices while they're making selections at the fish counter. No need to dig out a Seafood Watch card from the Monterey Bay Aquarium to double check whether mahi mahi is OK or search foggy memory banks for the status of arctic char. The colors--green for healthy populations and environmentally responsible practices, yellow to indicate some concern, and red for overfished or unsustainable--are right there on the fish, on small signs stuck into the display.  </p><p>The program, used locally in New Leaf Community Markets, is poised to explode, according to the UC Santa Cruz professor who advised Ish while she and Benoit developed the program and founded the Santa Cruz nonprofit that runs it, Sustainable Fishery Advocates.</p><p>"I think the organization is going to go through a fantastic growth spurt," said Marc Mangel, professor and chair of applied mathematics and statistics. "The time is absolutely right for their product." </p><p>FishWise, begun in 2002, started out at New Leaf Community Markets in Santa Cruz County; it's now used in 34 stores in California, and in August found roots outside the state, at Greenlife Grocery stores in Tennessee and North Carolina.  </p><p>That expansion has been a positive development, though the nonprofit would like to see more progress, said Tobias Aguirre, executive director of Sustainable Fishery Advocates, which counts six employees. </p><p>"It's a little slower than we would have liked, but we're ambitious and want to see conservation as soon as possible," said Aguirre. </p><p>Outside of global warming, unsustainable fishing is "one of the main threats facing the ocean," said Ish in a phone interview from her office in New York City, where she now works for Environmental Defense. Though she gave up her day-to-day role with the nonprofit when she moved to New York, she still serves on its board. </p><p> </p><p>"The way we think about seafood is different than how we think about land food, and it's one of the areas where the most education has to occur," said Ish, 29, explaining her and Benoit's passion for sustainable fishing practices and seafood choices. Ish earned a master's degree in marine science in 2003. Benoit earned an undergraduate degree from UC Davis and is a Ph.D. candidate at UCSC in ocean sciences. </p><p>Benoit, 34, is now on a yearlong global mountain trek with husband Rod Georgiu. She also serves on the board for Sustainable Fishery Advocates, calling in via Internet phone for meetings.</p><p>Ish moved east over the summer after having lived in Santa Cruz for seven years. Her husband, Eric Logue, is in a postdoctoral program at New York University after earning a Ph.D. at UC Berkeley. Both Ish and Logue also completed undergraduate degrees at UCSC; Ish majored in environmental studies and biology, while Logue majored in molecular cellular biology. </p><p>Mangel, the UC Santa Cruz professor, sat on the Sustainable Fishery Advocates board for four years, stepping down in July with the idea of allowing for some rotation of board members. </p><p>The public needs education about sustainable fishing because seafood consumption is increasing and putting pressure on world fisheries to supply the demand, said Executive Director Aguirre. </p><p>"That's resulted in significant environmental challenges, whether overfishing or habitat destruction," said Aguirre. "Our program gives consumers an opportunity to make a difference with their dollars."</p><p>Markets pay $150 per month per store to get set up and trained in the FishWise program. The vast majority of the organization's funding--85 percent--comes from foundations and grants, according to its 2005 annual report, the latest available; 10 percent comes from retailer fees, and 5 percent is from individual donations. </p><p>The retailer investment in the program pays off, said Aguirre: On average, participant retailers have seen an 11 percent total increase in their seafood sales. </p><p>And, he said, "the conservation side of that is they're clearly buying more of the environmentally responsible options and less of the non-environmentally responsible options." </p><p>Aguirre estimates that FishWise has reduced bycatch by 170,000 pounds, a number Sustainable Fishery Advocates calculates by gathering the number of pounds of each species sold by its retailers over time and using bycatch data specific to each fishery, then comparing the resulting figures with data for subsequent years. </p><p>Bycatch is the unintended catch of non-target species that can happen with less-selective fishing methods such as longlines or bottom trawlers, said Aguirre. It can include juveniles, seabirds, sea turtles, and sharks. </p><p>Ish and Benoit took a novel approach to applying their research in developing a nonprofit and seeing grocery stores as partners, said Mangel. </p><p>"It's sort of a perfect example of what we might like to see happen in terms of innovation and application of our academic work by our students," Mangel said. "They saw a need, they created a niche, they filled that niche. Teresa used all her academic skills and training she got in quantitative population biology to make FishWise a happening thing."</p><p>But also, he said, Ish's and Benoit's success comes in part from "not wanting to be environmental activists as much as environmental educators," said Mangel. "In addition to having the scientific background, they had the right personal skills to be able to convince somebody to give it a try."</p><p>Sustainability, at least with seafood, is something mainstream markets are talking about, said Ish. FishWise representatives are preparing to approach major grocery chains and food service companies next year, according to Aguirre. </p><p>The program's success and its future possibilities are exciting, said Ish. </p><p>"I'm fortunate in having the skills that can actually do something positive for a part of our world that people feel so connected to," she said. </p><p>For information, visit the <a href="http://www.fishwise.org">FishWise Web site</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9153a0658072704601a012ffd74266dc"><name>1677</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Information about moth spraying</title><start-date>1193122800000</start-date><display-name>Information about moth spraying...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1677</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1677</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338431001</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338431001</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As you may already know, the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) is planning pheromone applications for the Santa Cruz area as part of a program to eradicate the light brown apple moth, a pest that damages crops and other plants.

Langenheim Endowed Chair in Plant Ecology and Evolution. Parker is the first faculty member to hold the endowed chair, established by a gift of $350,000 from Jean Langenheim, professor emerita of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p><p>The endowment provides funds to support and encourage research and teaching in the area of terrestrial plant ecology and evolution, including studies of human impacts on plants, such as global warming, introduction of invasive plants, and ecosystem destruction.</p><p>"I wanted to support a continuation of the long-standing research at UCSC for understanding the relationships of plants to their environment, and their evolution to meet ever-changing conditions," Langenheim said. "We are very fortunate to be surrounded by such diverse flora and vegetation in this area, so this is a logical place to promote this kind of research. And I hope the chair will also enable faculty and students to expand their research to other parts of the world, particularly the tropics."</p><p>Langenheim is an eminent plant ecologist who has served as president of the Ecological Society of America, the International Society of Chemical Ecology, the Association for Tropical Biology, and the Society for Economic Botany. She has traveled throughout the world in the course of her research, focusing on tropical trees in her studies of the evolution of resin-producing trees and the origins of amber (fossil resin). She also studied the chemical ecology of redwoods and other Pacific Coast plants. </p><p>A UCSC faculty member since 1966, Langenheim was the campus's first female faculty member in the natural sciences and the first woman to be promoted to full professor. Although she retired in 1993, she continues to supervise graduate students and remains active in research. </p><p>Parker joined the UCSC faculty in 1998. Her research includes investigations of invasive plant species and the evolutionary interactions of plants and plant pathogens. She has ongoing research projects on invasive plants in California, from Monterey County to the Sierra Nevada, and is investigating a new disease of coconut palms in Panama with her husband Gregory Gilbert, professor of environmental studies. </p><p>"It is such an honor to be associated with Jean, who is a real pioneer in plant ecology and evolution," Parker said. "The endowment will provide valuable support for the projects of students who are working in plant biology on campus."</p><p>Her plans for using funds from the endowed chair include helping graduate students to participate in courses in tropical ecology offered in Costa Rica by the Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS). Langenheim has represented UC on the OTS board and helped establish some of these special graduate courses as the academic vice president of OTS. Several UCSC faculty members, including Parker, took the courses themselves as graduate students.</p><p>Parker also wants to use the funds to support UCSC's annual plant research symposium, which brings together faculty and students involved in plant research from various departments and divisions on campus.</p><p>The endowed chair is an honor that comes at an especially meaningful time for Parker, who spent much of the past year on partial medical leave while she underwent treatment for cancer.</p><p>"Being nominated by my department meant so much to me because it was a real vote of confidence looking toward the future. Last year was tough, and it's wonderful to be back," she said. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9153a3f38072704601a012ffd7a71e01"><name>1679</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Annual Computer Security Reminder</title><start-date>1191222000000</start-date><display-name>Annual Computer Security Reminder...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1679</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1679</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338431912</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338431912</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We write to remind you of the need to evaluate and protect sensitive data stored on computers and other electronic devices.

<p>The council of the 120,000-member society voted this year to award fellowships to 471 scientists and engineers. Each will receive a certificate and commemorative pin during the 2008 AAAS meeting in Boston.</p>
<p>Faber was recognized for "contributions to our understanding of galaxies, dark matter, and the formation of large-scale structure in the universe, and for scientific leadership in the community," according to a AAAS statement.</p>
<p>Faber uses the Hubble Space Telescope and the world's largest ground-based optical telescopes to study how galaxies form, learn about the evolution of structure in the universe, and look for exceedingly faint objects such as nuclear black holes. She has also made significant contributions to the technology used to study the heavens, leading efforts to construct more sensitive spectrographs, which are used to peer across the universe and far back in time.</p>
<p>Faber earned her Ph.D. in astronomy from Harvard in 1972. She joined the faculty of UCSC and the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory the same year and in 1995 was made University Professor, the highest honor for faculty in the UC system. In 2002, <em>Discover</em> magazine named Faber one of the country's top 50 women scientists. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.</p>
<p>In making Zhang a fellow, AAAS recognized his "distinguished contributions to the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology, particularly ultrafast studies of nanomaterials and their optical applications in energy conversion and biomedical detection."</p>
<p>Zhang's research capitalizes on the peculiar qualities of semiconductors, metal oxides, and metals and investigates how they may be useful as nanomaterials, tiny structures on the scale of atoms. Zhang studies these small structures--illuminated with laser flashes shorter than a billionth of a second--to explore ways to harness light energy for uses such as generating hydrogen fuel from water. His group also studies the use of nanomaterials for detecting cancer biomarkers. He cowrote a textbook, published in 2002, about self-assembly of materials at the nanoscale.</p>
<p>Zhang earned his B.Sc. at Fudan University, Shanghai, and his Ph.D. at the University of Washington in 1989. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1992.</p>
<p>AAAS, the world's largest general scientific society, was founded in 1848 and began its tradition of electing AAAS fellows in 1874. The society's peer-reviewed magazine, Science, is the world's highest-circulation scientific journal, with an estimated total readership of one million. The nonprofit organization is open to all and fulfills its mission to "advance science and serve society" through initiatives in science policy, international programs, science education, and more.</p>

"Environmental science and policy is one item on Chancellor Blumenthal's new list of six major themes for the campus, and this study is basically a measure of how strong we already are."</p><p>The study's authors, led by Jacqualine Grant of Michigan Technological University, used a measurement called the Hirsch index to gauge each institution's research impact. The index balances the total number of publications against how often other articles have cited those papers. </p><p>Citations are a useful indication of respect. Each published article contributes an idea or a finding to a field of study, and subsequent researchers acknowledge that contribution each time they cite a paper. In general, the more insightful the idea or innovative the finding, the more often it will be cited.</p><p>The Hirsch index gives smaller institutions, like UCSC, a chance against larger ones with more overall publications. In the <i>Conservation Biology</i> study, the seven universities ranked immediately below UC Santa Cruz had produced more conservation papers than UCSC scientists, but the UCSC papers tended to be cited more often.</p><p>Such rankings are common in other disciplines, and other UCSC departments have fared well in them, including scoring first among U.S. universities in space sciences (in 2003) and physics (in 2000 and 2007), and second worldwide in physical sciences (in 2001). But this study was the first to attempt such rankings for the relatively new field of conservation biology. The attention underscores the rigorous scientific work that has come to dominate the field, which in its early years was often regarded as an offshoot of environmentalism. </p><p>"Our campus and other UC campuses have been really paving the way with recognition of conservation biology as an academic endeavor," said Peter Raimondi, professor and chair of ecology and environmental biology. "There are two reasons why: The campus lends itself to the ideas of conservation biology because of the natural setting we're in. And--for marine groups--around Monterey Bay there's a huge number of affiliated institutions that are interested in similar topics, so there's a synergy."</p><p>Marine research at UCSC includes now-classic studies of sea otters and kelp forests as well as work on elephant seal biology, seabird migration, whale populations, island conservation, and a recent breakthrough for loggerhead sea turtles, among other projects. </p><p>That's not to say that UCSC biologists have overlooked conservation research on land. Among its faculty, the campus can count ecologist Michael Soulé, professor emeritus of environmental studies, who co-founded the Society for Conservation Biology and has been called the "father of conservation biology." John Thompson, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, is a leading authority on coevolution and its implications for conservation. President-elect of the American Society of Naturalists, Thompson was recognized as one of the most highly cited researchers in "ecology/environment" in a 2003 analysis.</p><p>Thompson was the founding director of the STEPS Institute for Innovation in Environmental Research, created in 2002 to enable interdisciplinary research between members of the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences and the Division of Social Sciences, along with collaborators from organizations outside UCSC. The STEPS Institute is presently under the interim directorship of James Estes, adjunct professor of marine sciences.</p><p>In the study's ranking, UC Santa Cruz appears just under list-toppers Oregon State University, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Davis. UC Berkeley ranked sixth; in all, nine UC schools made it into the top 40. The study's authors represented institutions ranked seventh (University of Washington, Seattle), eleventh (University of Montana, Missoula), fourteenth (University of Florida, Gainesville), and thirtieth (Michigan Technological University).</p><p>"It's very flattering," said Sheldon Kamieniecki, dean of social sciences. "We have a number of very good people here whose research is being paid attention to across the country."</p><p>"Our natural reserves provide a terrific opportunity for scholars to come here and do research in this area and do it well--to provide insights you wouldn't get in any other part of the country," Kamieniecki added. "It's another example of how taking advantage of our natural setting has been fundamental to the success of our campus."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9153ad3a8072704601a012ff2c4cde5c"><name>1685</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Rainbow Theatre to perform six works in November</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Rainbow theatre, theater, diversity, culture, students</keywords><start-date>1193295600000</start-date><display-name>Rainbow Theatre to perform...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1685</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1685</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338434290</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338434290</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/10/images/rainbow.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/10/images/rainbow.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rainbow.250.jpg</name><file-size>51961</file-size><width>250</width><height>332</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Rainbow Theatre is on a mission to create a greater understanding of the different cultures that make up the campus community</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Rainbow Theatre will present six works directed or written by students this November as the troupe heads into its 14th season at UCSC.</p>
<p>Founded by Don Williams, director of Cultural Arts and Diversity for the Student Affairs Division, Rainbow Theatre is on a mission to create a greater understanding of the different cultures that make up the campus community.</p>
<p>"By giving students an opportunity to experience new literature and materials from other cultures through lectures and productions, Rainbow Theatre serves to enhance the cultural climate of UCSC," said Williams. "Our mission is to foster a spirit of unity by breaking down cultural walls, providing an outlet for creative talents of various ethnic groups, and focusing on the concerns of our communities."</p>
<p>Rainbow Theatre is both a class and a company of 115 students. Members may participate by writing, acting, directing, or producing, as well as working on sound, props, lighting and costumes for the annual productions. In class, they choose the plays and learn about the historical context of each work.</p>
<p>"We motivate students by giving them a better understanding of various cultures," said Williams. "For example, a lot of students don't know about the Japanese internment camps that were created after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. So we are doing a play about that, and we had a guest come to class who was actually in one of the camps and could give the students a personal sense of history."</p>
<p>Williams added that this year Rainbow Theatre has for the first time organized its own outreach group to perform off campus. Made up of 14 students, the group will perform a mix of spoken word, songs, and vignettes about life issues and political trends.</p>
<p>The 2007 fall shows include:</p>
<p><strong>Chicano/Latino Production</strong></p>
<p>Directed by Karla Flores and Yvonne Franklin</p>
<p><em>Black Butterfly, Jaguar Girl, PiÃ±ata Woman and Other Superhero Girls Like Me</em></p>
<p>By Luis Alfaro</p>
<p>Several beauties blossom on the streets of East Los Angeles as the playwright follows the journey of five young women as they struggle with pressing issues that arise in their lives. As they mature, all the wonders they fly through bring these girls together and empower them. These women bring the diverse community of East L.A. to the rest of the world through their message of sadness and strength.</p>
<p><strong>Asian American Production</strong></p>
<p>Directed by Quincy Surasmith and Rachel Bennish</p>
<p><em>12-1-A</em></p>
<p>By Wakako Yamauchi</p>
<p>Wakako Yamauchi's <em>12-1-A</em> is a beautiful and poetic story of the Tanaka family's endurance, and identity, as seen through the context of day-to-day life. The Tanaka family, whose experiences mirror Yamauchi's own, is forcibly removed from its home and sent to an internment camp at the beginning of the U.S. entry into World War II. The family is sequestered alongside 120,000 other Japanese and Japanese Americans living on the West Coast of the United States. Living in the barrack for which the play is named, the Tanakas deal with questions of loyalty, citizenship, rights, and their relationship to the United States and to each other. While the war continues and their futures remain uncertain, the Tanaka family members struggle to stay together, unsure of whether they will ever experience freedom once more.</p>
<p><strong>African American Production</strong></p>
<p>Directed by Lisa Evans and Antonio Glass</p>
<p><em>Taking of Miss Janie</em></p>
<p>By Ed Bullins</p>

<p><em>The Taking of Ms. Janie</em> examines interracial relationships of the 1960s and '70s--one of the most socially turbulent times in American history. This era was a time of massive social change, and this play strives to discuss how the ideas, culture, and beliefs of the times affect the way blacks and whites interact, both romantically and socially.</p>
<p><strong>Poets Corner</strong></p>
<p>Directed by Sampada Aranke and Charley Fierro</p>
<p>By members of Poets Corner</p>
<p>A collective consisting of writers, dancers, singers, and artists who work together to write and create a showcase based on each member's own personal story. Because of the unique nature of Poets Corner, each year the final showcase depicts a different aspect of our multicultural community.</p>
<p><strong>The Fifth Element</strong></p>
<p>Directed by Valerie Gibbins and Zury Ruiz</p>
<p><em>Twilight</em></p>
<p>By Anna Deavere Smith</p>
<p>In 1992, a verdict was announced that acquitted four LAPD officers of the violent beating of an African American man, Rodney King. This sparked a series of events that have brought to light prejudices within the judicial system of Los Angeles and the nation. <em>Twilight</em> is a compilation of monologues derived from interviews with various people involved in the riots incited by the verdict. These monologues range from first-hand accounts to public speeches, each contributing to the depiction of the turmoil felt by the city of Los Angeles and the greater nation.</p>

<p><strong>Community Outreach</strong></p>
<p>Directed by Irlanda Pulido &amp; Pedro Rivas</p>
<p><em>En La Tiendita</em></p>
<p>By Pedro Rivas</p>
<p>A play telling a story of untold stories seeking the impossible.

There are many ways in which members of the campus community can provide support to the victims of the recent Southern California fires. This <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1695">special web page</a> lists several ways.</td>

This week's events remind us that providing for the well-being of our students, staff, and faculty is a very high priority on our campus.<br/>
<br/>
<p>Therefore, I would like to encourage any students experiencing emotional stress as a result of this tragedy to make use of the services available from our Counseling &amp; Psychological group at the Student Health Center. Contact information is available at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/counsel">www2.ucsc.edu/counsel</a></p>
<p>This kind of critical support is also available to our faculty and staff through UCSC's Employee Assistance Program. Information on the program can be found at: <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/topics/benefits/eap">shr.ucsc.edu/topics/benefits/eap</a></p>
<p>Later this week a more detailed <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/messages/text.asp?pid=1692">message will be sent directly to all students from Student Affairs Vice Chancellor Felicia McGinty</a>. The message will provide information about emergency financial assistance, academic accommodation, and campus outreach to students directly affected by the fire.</p>
<p>We also expect to provide follow-up information soon about volunteer and donation activities.</p>
<p>Please join with me in extending our deepest condolences to the many, many people affected by this week's events.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9153b2038072704601a012ff843510f8"><name>1689</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Safety tips from Physical Plant</title><summary>With the onset of winter, be careful walking and driving around campus.</summary><description>With the onset of winter, be careful walking and driving around campus.</description><start-date>1193382000000</start-date><display-name>Safety tips from Physical...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1689</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1689</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338435542</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338435542</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As you make your way around campus, remember to be cautious about slipping hazards, which can be more of a problem as it gets dark earlier and the rainy weather begins.

Work is slated to begin Monday, October 29, and continue weekdays through Tuesday, November 6, with the most disruptive work scheduled for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Campus commuters should anticipate some traffic delays between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. as construction crews conduct their work.</p><p>When construction is underway, the Bay/High traffic signal will be switched to "flashing red" with flaggers present to provide traffic control through the intersection.  The left-turn lane exiting campus's Main Entrance onto High Street will be closed to traffic during these times.  Additionally, a pedestrian crosswalk at the Bay/High intersection will be closed while construction is underway; signs will direct pedestrians to the crosswalk on the opposite side of High Street.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Office of Public Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9153b75f8072704601a012ffd01dd344"><name>1692</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Support for students affected by Southern California fires</title><start-date>1193382000000</start-date><display-name>Support for students affected...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1692</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1692</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338436889</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338436889</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I want to acknowledge the concerns, sorrow and grief that many of you may be experiencing as a result of the Southern California wildfires.  The massive evacuations, extensive loss of property, disruption of daily life and in some cases, loss of life, have personally touched our community. Although we do not yet know the full extent of the damages that will result from this catastrophe, we know that many of you and many in our community have been and will be affected in some way. To support you during this time, I want to provide a brief summary of several of the resources that are available to students on the campus.</p><p>Counseling Services:</p><p>Support and assistance is available to any UCSC student who is experiencing stress as a result of the wildfires or other emotional challenges.  Contact information is available at <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/counsel/">http://www2.ucsc.edu/counsel/</a> or students may call (831) 459-2628.</p><p>College and Housing Residential Staff:</p><p>UCSC has a very well trained, responsive and available residential staff. Many members of our residential staff have a background in advising and solid experiences in crisis response/crisis management.  These staff members can provide assistance and advice on the resources available on campus.  I have asked the staff at the Colleges to make direct contact with campus residents who are from the impacted Southern California counties to check-in with you directly about the impacts of the fires and assistance that you may need.</p><p>Emergency Financial Support:</p><p>Emergency short term loans of varying amounts are available to any registered student.  Loan application forms are available at the Financial Aid Office (Hahn Student Services Building, room 205) or online at <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/fin-aid/emergency_loan.shtml">http://www2.ucsc.edu/fin-aid/emergency_loan.shtml</a>  These loans usually require repayment in 30 to 60 days and are interest free.  The Financial Aid Office can also assist with federal student loan increases to your current loan amount for those that are eligible.  These loans do not require repayment until after graduation. Financial Aid staff can be reached at (831) 459-2963.</p><p>Academic Accommodation:</p><p>If this catastrophic event impacts your studies, I encourage you to speak with your College Academic Advisor, Department Advisor or professors to understand the accommodations that might be made for you given your circumstances.</p><p>Volunteerism and Opportunities for Giving:</p><p>For those in our campus community that would like to provide support to residents directly impacted by the fires, the Student Volunteer Center web site (<a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/svc/"> http://www2.ucsc.edu/svc/</a>) provides links to organizations that accept donations.  Please continue to visit the Student Volunteer Center web site for information regarding other opportunities to participate in relief efforts.</p><p>In closing, I want to again extend my support to any student who may be impacted by the firestorms and encourage you to use the resources that are available through campus support services.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>All Students</audience><admin>Vice Chancellor Felicia E.

The campus's petition was approved last month at the society's annual convention, and the California Alpha Delta Chapter of Tau Beta Pi will be officially installed at UCSC in February 2008. </p><p>Founded in 1885, Tau Beta Pi recognizes students of distinguished scholarship and exemplary character, emphasizing integrity, excellence, and dedication to service. It represents the entire engineering profession, with a current membership of almost 500,000 and chapters at 232 U.S. colleges and universities. </p><p>"Tau Beta Pi is the nation's second oldest honor society for undergraduates. It's not just about getting a certificate for good grades, but really emphasizes a commitment to service," said faculty adviser Richard Hughey, professor of computer engineering.</p><p>UCSC's petition was led by the <a href="http://honors.soe.ucsc.edu">Engineering Honor Society</a>, established by students in the Baskin School of Engineering in 2004. A preliminary petition was approved in 2006, leading to a site visit from the national organization and several California chapters.</p><p>Erik Pasternak, current president of the Engineering Honor Society, led the UCSC delegation to the 2007 Annual Convention of Tau Beta Pi, held October 11 to 13 in Dearborn, Michigan. The delegation also included vice president Andrew Parra and previous presidents Andrew Hill and John Burr, as well as Hughey.</p><p>"The convention was particularly impressed with the sense of community within our Engineering Honor Society, the continued involvement of alumni, and the society's outreach to local schools and other service projects," Hughey said.</p><p>Pasternak and Parra, who gave a presentation at the convention, agreed that UCSC stands out for the number of projects and the high level of participation in the honor society. The group has organized workshops and campus tours for high school students from the Santa Cruz and San Jose areas, using fun and challenging projects such as a "nanomouse" to convey different aspects of engineering (see <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/05-22/outreach.asp">earlier story</a>). </p><p>Another project that made a favorable impression at the convention, according to Hughey, is the Undergraduate Hardware Lab, a collaboration of the Engineering Honor Society and the UCSC chapters of the IEEE and the Society for Women Engineers (SWE). The lab was established this year with a $90,000 equipment donation from Agilent Technologies.</p><p>"The students wanted a space where they could work on independent projects that aren't associated with their classes. They sought out donors, gave a great presentation to Agilent about a year ago, and the equipment arrived just before the delegation left for the convention. So now they've got their own room with $90,000 of equipment where they can work on their own projects," Hughey said.</p><p>The top fifth of seniors and the top eighth of juniors may be considered for election based on achievement, service, and character. Initially, students and alumni in computer engineering and electrical engineering will be eligible for membership. Students from other engineering majors will be considered for eligibility once the chapter is established, Hughey said.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9153bef78072704601a012ffcb858bfb"><name>1698</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Undergraduates tailor UCSC Genome Browser to aid malaria research</title><summary>UCSC undergraduates have created a genome browser for studying the malaria parasite, enabling a team of UCSC researchers to discover previously unknown genes that could help in the search for antimalarial drugs.</summary><author>Hugh Powell (831) 459-2495, hpowell@ucsc.edu; Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495, stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Manuel Ares, undergraduate research, malaria, genome browser</keywords><description>UCSC undergraduates have created a genome browser for studying the malaria parasite, enabling a team of UCSC researchers to discover previously unknown genes that could help in the search for antimalarial drugs.</description><start-date>1193727600000</start-date><display-name>Undergraduates tailor UCSC Genome...</display-name><path>/2007/10/1698</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/10/1698</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338438844</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338438844</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/10/images/tim_jonathan_250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/10/images/tim_jonathan_250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tim_jonathan_250.jpg</name><file-size>52056</file-size><width>250</width><height>188</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Timothy Sterne-Weiler and Jonathan Deans developed the malaria genome browser.

A team of UCSC researchers used the new browser to discover previously unknown genes that could help in the search for antimalarial drugs. Their findings appear in the November issue of the journal <em>RNA.</em></p>
<p>Timothy Sterne-Weiler and Jonathan Deans, bioinformatics majors who graduated earlier this year, based their malaria genome browser on the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Genome Browser</a>, a widely used research tool developed for studying the human genome and maintained by UCSC's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering. Sterne-Weiler and Deans did the work as members of the Hughes Undergraduate Research Lab, an interdisciplinary group started by Manuel Ares, Jr., professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, with support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.</p>
<p>Over the lab's four-year tenure, 60 undergraduates collaborated with graduate students and research staff to complete their own research. Ares said that bioinformatics students made up about a third of the group and were key to sorting through the data-rich results of experiments.</p>
<p>"There's a whole revolution in biology going on right now, where computer science is colliding with classic biological science approaches," Ares said. "At that interface, there's a lot that can be done."</p>
<p>Students typically spent two to three years in the program, which required a time commitment of one class per quarter, including summers. Ares gave the students more autonomy than typically afforded undergraduates, including keys to the lab. They worked with graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to pursue their own research, gaining an appreciation of life in academic research along the way. Ongoing projects in the lab included work on the SARS virus, malaria, and the basic biology of yeast cells.</p>
<p>Sterne-Weiler said he appreciated the opportunity to come to grips with real, unsolved problems. "I got into the lab and I was actually doing all the things I was really interested in, and learning a lot more than I ever could out of classes," he said. "It kind of kept me going, because I had a focus that I could see in front of me."</p>
<p>That's not to say they found research a breeze. One of the main skills the students learned was resourcefulness. "You're chugging along and all of a sudden you hit a wall. It's like, 'Well, what do I do now? I've never done this before,' " Deans said. "I'm not a computer administrator; I don't know what these errors mean. But you start to learn to think on your feet."</p>
<p>The new malaria genome browser brings together on a single screen the full DNA sequences of eight species of the malaria parasite <em>(Plasmodium),</em> alongside experimental results and previously discovered genes culled from the literature. The program allows users to search through the 26 million letters and 14 chromosomes of the parasite's genome, enter their own sequence data and notes, and quickly compare findings across species. In the weeks since the malaria genome browser went live, it has received more than 5,000 hits from six continents, and has been linked in a forthcoming version of PlasmoDB, the international repository for information on <em>Plasmodium</em> genetics.</p>
<p>Once the malaria browser was up and running, members of the Ares lab led by research biologist Kausik Chakrabarti used the system to search for undiscovered "structural RNA" genes. The browser enabled Chakrabarti to predict the locations of DNA regions that produce the RNA sequences he is interested in. After this computer-bound, "dry side" of the operation, he and other colleagues perform "wet side" experiments that isolate those sequences and find out if the predictions are correct.</p>
<p>RNA is a single-stranded counterpart of the DNA double helix. Whereas DNA stores genetic information inside a cell's nucleus, RNA copies of genes are ferried out into the cell, where structures called ribosomes use the information to assemble proteins. But some genes make small pieces of RNA that don't code for proteins. These so-called structural RNA molecules perform jobs such as splicing together other sections of RNA or combining with proteins to make specialized enzymes, such as the ribosome.</p>
<p>Because structural RNA performs key tasks in the cell, researchers study it for ways to disrupt disease organisms. The well-known antibiotic erythromycin, for example, works by exploiting a difference between the ribosomal RNA of humans and that of bacteria. When a patient takes erythromycin, it disrupts the bacteria's ability to make proteins, but not the patient's.</p>
<p>Chakrabarti hopes to find similar drug targets by studying the newfound RNA sequences and looking for differences between the human and malarial versions. Among his targets is an enzyme called telomerase that is made up of both RNA and protein. The enzyme repairs a chromosome region that happens to control malaria's virulence. If Chakrabarti can find a way to shut off the enzyme in <em>Plasmodium</em> but not in humans, the result could be a potent antimalarial drug.</p>
<p>He is also interested in telomerase because it works as a reverse transcriptase, synthesizing new DNA from RNA. That's one of the characteristics that allows HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to commandeer human cells so successfully.</p>
<p>"Basically, we're trying to hit two diseases with one stone," Chakrabarti said.</p>
<p>The Hughes Undergraduate Research Lab finished operation in 2006, and the Ares lab's malaria work is also coming to a close. Chakrabarti hopes to get more funding, but for now the malaria genome browser is being kept alive by the volunteer work of Deans, Sterne-Weiler, and John Paul Donohue, a research specialist in Ares's lab and coauthor of the paper.</p>
<p>"With malaria, since it's a tropical disease, most of the funding is private," Chakrabarti said. Despite the millions malaria kills each year, federal funding priorities emphasize diseases that strike closer to home, he said. Grants increasingly come from smaller private foundations, as large philanthropic trusts focus on research into treating the disease rather than basic biology of the parasite, he said.</p>
<p>Sterne-Weiler is now a UCSC graduate student pursuing a master's degree in bioinformatics. Deans, who now works at Santa Cruz Biotech, also plans to pursue a graduate degree. Their accomplishments represent the kind of experience Ares had in mind when he designed the undergraduate lab.</p>
<p>"When someone goes through our current university system, they're actually being forced to think in a disciplinary fashion," Ares said. "The idea was to break this down, to create an experience where students learn that to solve a research problem you really can't do it with any one discipline."</p>
<p>In addition to Chakrabarti, Sterne-Weiler, Deans, Ares, and Donohue, the paper's coauthors include UCSC graduate student Michael Pearson and postdoctoral fellow Leslie Grate. The malaria genome browser can be accessed at the <a href="http://areslab.ucsc.edu/">Ares Lab web site</a>.</p>
