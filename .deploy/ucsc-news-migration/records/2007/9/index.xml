The award, valued at over $120,000, includes 42 tablet computers, additional hardware, and $15,000.</p>
<p>HP's gift to UCSC fits well with the vision of a fully wired classroom long held by Patrick Mantey, UCSC's Jack Baskin Professor of Computer Engineering. In 2004, Mantey designed such a classroom for the Baskin School of Engineering. Called the Simularium, it allows up to 16 computers at a time to upload and download from four projection screens, freeing students from the long, uninterrupted lectures that Mantey calls "death by PowerPoint."</p>
<p>"The more students you have in a classroom, the less interactive and participatory it becomes. So I've been trying to find ways to put more excitement and engagement into classes," Mantey said. "The HP grant is letting us fill the gaps for students who don't have their own computers, so that every student in every seat has a computer. And the tablets have some nice features."</p>
<p>Since 2004, HP reports it has given away more than $40 million to 850 schools worldwide. "HP's Technology for Teaching grant program is intended to stimulate new ideas about the role of computers in the classroom," said Jim Vanides, manager of the Higher Education Philanthropy program at HP.</p>
<p>Tablet computers are similar in size to notebook computers but feature a digital pen that allows users to draw directly on the screen. Wireless connections allow all the machines in a single classroom to link together even without a wi-fi connection. For a student, it's like writing in a notebook, watching a lecture, and standing at the blackboard all at the same time.</p>
<p>Among a half-dozen engineering faculty who use the tablets, Gabriel Elkaim, assistant professor of computer engineering, records his lectures on the fly directly from his tablet, right down to the notes he writes in the margins of his slides. The result, so far, has been better attendance and more participation in class, he said.</p>
<p>Elkaim's recordings go online five minutes after a lecture ends. The archived files free students from furiously transcribing notes, allowing them to think about the material and ask questions, Elkaim said. After class--or just before an exam--students can return to Elkaim's lectures and fast forward to the parts they're having trouble with.</p>
<p>The tablets also thrust students into the middle of classroom action. "I can assign them a little quickie exercise where I have them fill in the blanks on a PowerPoint slide I put up, or write a segment of code, or draw a diagram," said Charlie McDowell, professor of computer science. "Students fire that off to me in class, and I can bring some of them up on the screen for discussion. And it's not threatening, because it's anonymous."</p>
<p>But will students take the new computers and immediately start surfing YouTube in class? "I look at it this way: If students don't want to pay attention in class, they don't need the Internet for that," Elkaim said.</p>
<p>McDowell, too, was philosophical. "If I'm not doing something in class that makes them feel like they want to pay attention, that's partly my problem," he said.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz was chosen for the grant based on the engineering school's success in implementing a 2005 HP grant that allowed the school to use HP technology to enhance instruction, to demonstrate a measurable, positive impact on student achievement, and to propose innovative plans to expand its programs. This year's grant, awarded to the top 10 performers among previous grantees, is nearly double the value--and nearly triples the number of tablets--of the 2005 award.</p>
<p>Someday soon, Mantey said, wirelessly networked classes where students participate equally with teachers won't be innovative, they'll be routine. With grants like HP's, he said, the Baskin School of Engineering is getting closer to that day.</p>

<p>The new telescope will collect starlight on an 8-foot (2.4-meter) primary mirror and direct it into a world-class spectrometer to be named for the Levys. When the instrument begins its work next May, it will devote all its time to searching for the telltale light shifts that indicate a planet orbiting around a distant star. The new spectrometer will bring within reach one of astronomy's longest-held goals: the discovery of an Earth-sized planet in another solar system.</p>
<p>A spectrometer's job is to split a pencil-sized beam of starlight into a rainbow of constituent colors and then measure very accurately the positions of dark "absorption lines" in the rainbow. The new instrument marks a pinnacle in the career of veteran spectrometer designer Steven Vogt, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. Vogt's past designs include the two most successful planet-finding spectrometers in operation today--the high-resolution "HIRES" spectrometer, mounted on the 10-meter Keck I Telescope at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, and the Hamilton spectrometer on the 3-meter Shane Telescope at Lick Observatory.</p>
<p>Over his career, Vogt said, "I've gathered a lot of knowledge about the right ways to do things, and I've poured everything I know into this design."</p>
<p>Vogt is one of the principal scientists on the California-Carnegie Planet Search team, a group of astronomers who search the skies for extrasolar planets, or planets beyond our solar system. Other members of the group's science team include Geoffrey Marcy of UC Berkeley, who was Vogt's first graduate student, Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and Debra Fischer of San Francisco State University.</p>
<p>"We're beyond delighted that Ken Levy is going to make this search for other Earths possible," Marcy said.</p>
<p>The team has an extraordinary record of finding extrasolar planets, having discovered around 140 of the 240 found so far. Most of those planets have been the size of Jupiter or Saturn--roughly 300 times the size of Earth.</p>
<p>"It's quite remarkable. They've opened a brand-new branch of science, the science of extrasolar planets," said Michael Bolte, director of UC Observatories/Lick Observatory (UCO/Lick).</p>
<p>The Automated Planet Finder will set its sights on small, Earth-like planets, ones that orbit their stars at the right distance for water to exist as a liquid and that might feature a rocky surface where water could pool and serve as a cradle of life.</p>
<p>The instrument will check in on 25 stars per night during every clear night of the year, using an intelligent program that decides which stars to watch based on criteria such as sky conditions, the Earth's position in space, and results from previous observations. Over the next decade, the telescope will study 1,000 nearby stars, all within about 50 light-years.</p>
<p>Finding planets that are trillions of miles away is no small feat. Researchers do it by watching for shifts in the colors emanating from stars. The principle involved is similar to the way a radar gun can measure the speed of a car or a pitcher's fastball. Astronomers use Doppler shifts in the wavelengths of starlight as evidence that the star is speeding up or slowing down in response to the gravitational tug of an orbiting planet.</p>
<p>"We're looking for shifts in the spectrum on the focal plane of the spectrometer that are on the order of a thousandth of a pixel," Vogt said. "And we have to be able to find those shifts and track them from year to year, summer to winter, spring to fall. The shifts we're looking for amount to a distance of about 80 atoms on the surface of the CCD [camera]."</p>
<p>To be sure a planet is there, scientists must observe the star through several of the planet's orbits, and that can take six months to several years for the kinds of planets the team hopes to detect. With observational time on the world's elite telescopes limited to only a few nights in a row for any one project, the team realized their best bet was to build their own.</p>
<p>The Automated Planet Finder telescope is less than a quarter the size--and gathers less than one-sixteenth the light--of the 10-meter Keck Telescopes, the largest optical telescopes currently in use. Vogt said he "bought back" much of the difference with superlative optical components and a new spectrometer design. The result is an efficiency two to four times greater than that of the Keck and other leading telescopes. "Thirty percent of the photons are usable by science," Vogt said.</p>
<p>To conserve light, Vogt decided to forgo the standard fiberoptic cables that carry telescope light to a spectrometer inside a climate-controlled room. Fiberoptics can squander as much as 30 percent of the light, Vogt said, so he shrank his design enough to bolt it directly onto the telescope. The new spectrometer is the size of a phone booth, he said, compared to previous models that were twice the size of his office.</p>
<p>Vogt surrounded the spectrometer with a steel and magnesium skeleton that passively adjusts its shape as temperatures change, keeping the system's optics in perfect alignment. The rigid, lightweight frame also keeps the spectrometer from flexing or sagging as the rotating telescope carries the instrument away from the vertical.</p>

<p>Other innovations include silver instead of the standard aluminum mirrors and antireflective lens coatings that Vogt had custom-made at the Lick Optical Laboratory on the UCSC campus. The computer program that makes sense of the spectrometer readings, written by Butler, accounts for everything from Earth's spin to the way relativity warps starlight as it speeds past the Sun.</p>
<p>Kenneth Levy became interested in the hunt for distant planets after hearing Marcy speak about the project. Later, Marcy and Levy toured the Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton, east of San Jose. The two spent an hour examining the optical system that occupies a room nicknamed "the Dungeon" beneath the Shane Telescope.</p>
<p>Levy, whose background is in electrical engineering, "very quickly captured the notion of the extraordinary optical engineering that UCO/Lick does," Marcy said. "He is a connoisseur of some of the best optical engineering in the world, so we appreciate each other."</p>
<p>Levy built his career around a pioneering Silicon Valley firm, KLA (now KLA-Tencor), that he founded in the 1970s. He was the firm's CEO for more than 20 years and served as chairman of the board from 1999 until he retired in 2006. He and his wife, Gloria, are involved in philanthropy through their foundation.</p>
<p>When Levy learned that the Automated Planet Finder would employ an even more sophisticated optical system, albeit one built on the astronomical version of a shoestring, he asked what he could do to help, Marcy said.</p>
<p>Additional funding for the APF has been provided by the U.S. Naval Observatory, NASA, the National Science Foundation, and UCO/Lick.</p>
<p>The Automated Planet Finder will be the seventh major telescope at the Lick Observatory, located on the summit of Mt. Hamilton at an elevation of 4,200 feet. Founded in 1888, Lick remains one of the most productive research observatories in the world. UCO/Lick, headquartered on the UCSC campus, operates the Lick Observatory and is a managing partner of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.</p>

<p>A native of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Pilak has an extensive background in arts management that spans both coasts. She became the first festival manager at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC, where she was responsible for coordinating regional, national, and international performing arts festivals. During her tenure, she produced the annual Kennedy Center Open House Arts Festival, a one-day festival of more than 300 artists on seven stages, attracting 100,000 attendees. She also served as director of programs for the 30,000-member Friends of the Kennedy Center and the National Symphony Orchestra.</p>
<p>In 1993, Pilak moved to the West Coast to become director of programming and marketing at the Hult Center for the Performing Arts in Eugene, Oregon, where she managed a 30-event annual performance series, as well as Cuthbert Amphitheater, a summer outdoor venue.</p>
<p>Pilak moved to Portland in 2000 to become the director of the Oregon Creative Services Alliance, a trade association with an economic development mission to create a regional brand awareness of the more than 6,000 creative firms in Oregon. For the past several years, she has worked as an independent management consultant, serving nonprofit and economic-development clients across the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>"I'm looking forward to working with the entire UCSC campus community," said Pilak. "In my first incarnation as a performing arts presenter, I was driven by a love for the arts and a deep respect for the artists. Now, after several years of working in the area of cultural economic development, I have a much broader appreciation for the foundational role the arts plays in our communities," she added.</p>

Primack is the senior cosmologist on the National Research Council (NRC) committee that issued the report, which recommends pursuing at least two ambitious space missions that should yield extraordinary results for astrophysics researchers at UCSC and around the world.</p>
<p>"These missions address key questions that will take science beyond the achievements of the Einstein century," Primack said.</p>
<p>The recommendations include a mission to investigate dark energy and the expansion of the universe, and another to explore black holes and gravity waves. These are among the most exciting areas of current cosmological research, Primack said.</p>
<p>NASA's "Beyond Einstein" program originally had outlined a robust astrophysics program involving numerous space missions, all of which were indefinitely postponed in 2004 when President Bush announced a new "Vision for Space Exploration." The Bush plan made NASA's top priority to put astronauts back on the Moon and eventually send them to Mars, but scientists were disappointed to see funding for science missions cut. NASA's decision to cancel a mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope caused such an outcry, not only among scientists but also from the general public, that it was eventually reversed.</p>
<p>In 2004, Primack chaired a panel of the American Physical Society that issued a report on the Bush Administration's Moon-Mars program, predicting it would have dire effects on U.S. space-based astronomy.</p>
<p>"I am hopeful that the NRC Beyond Einstein report will help the U.S. restart our promising programs for exploration of the universe," he said.</p>
<p>Other UCSC faculty have also been at the forefront of efforts to restore funding for space-science programs. Professor of astronomy and astrophysics Garth Illingworth, for example, who chairs the congressionally chartered Astronomy and Astrophysics Advisory Committee, testified before Congress in May about the effects of budget cutbacks on NASA's science program (see <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2007/05/1266.html">earlier story</a>).</p>
<p>The NRC committee, established under pressure from Congress, was charged with reassessing NASA's Beyond Einstein program and recommending which of the program's five proposed mission areas should be developed and launched first.</p>
<p>The committee gave first priority to the Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM), a joint program of NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy to measure how the universe's expansion rate has changed over time. In 1998, scientists studying supernovae discovered that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. This led to the idea of dark energy, a mysterious force that permeates the universe and drives its rate of expansion. But dark energy remains one of the most puzzling concepts in modern cosmology.</p>
<p>Three groups are working on proposals for the JDEM mission, and NASA will choose which proposal to fund. All three proposals aim to precisely measure the expansion history of the universe to determine whether the contribution of dark energy to the expansion rate varies with time.</p>
<p>The committee's second priority is the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a mission that has been in development for some 20 years. Its primary objective is to detect gravitational waves, ripples in space-time caused by the movement of massive bodies such as black holes. These waves are predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity, but have yet to be directly detected. LISA would be used to study the mergers of supermassive black holes and to probe the early universe. According to Primack, NRC committee members estimated that three Nobel Prizes could ultimately be awarded on the basis of results from the LISA mission.</p>
<p>Although implementation of NASA's Beyond Einstein Progam has been delayed, Primack said the committee has recommended that all of the original missions still be supported and considered for eventual implementation.</p>
<p>"All of the mission areas in the Beyond Einstein program have the potential to fundamentally alter our understanding of the universe," said committee co-chair Charles F. Kennel of UC San Diego. "But JDEM will provide direct insight into a key Beyond Einstein science question and is the most technically feasible option for immediate development."</p>

<p>The regional K-12 teacher workforce will be the focus of the conference, which will take place at the UCSC Music Recital Hall from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>"Despite great progress, the region continues to have far too many underqualified math, science, and special education teachers," said Lora Bartlett, assistant professor of education at UCSC and a keynote speaker at the conference. "This is an issue of teacher recruitment and retention, and it's an issue of educational equity and social justice. This summit is bringing together the people committed to improving learning conditions for all of our region's students."</p>
<p>A specialist in teacher workforce issues, Bartlett will present her findings as chair the research committee of the Teacher Workforce Initiative, a three-year collaborative effort to generate a detailed portrait of the region's teacher workforce, including qualifications, job satisfaction, turnover, and retention.</p>
<p>The Sept. 21 conference, "2020 Vision: The Future of Education in the Monterey Bay Region," is being hosted by the UC Santa Cruz Educational Partnership Center (EPC) on behalf of the Monterey Bay Educational Consortium (MBEC). The consortium is made up of top administrators of local schools, colleges, and universities, who collaborate to raise the educational achievement of all students in the region.</p>
<p>"The quality of teaching is a critical factor in improving the academic success of students, and this summit lays the groundwork for educators to work together to find solutions to local teacher workforce issues," said Carrol Moran, executive director of the EPC.</p>
<p>Although school districts are required by law to provide the state with annual data regarding teachers, districts often lack the resources to analyze the data in a timely way. Bartlett expanded the data-collection effort to include detailed information about salaries, benefits, school-based working conditions, and teacher turnover rates, which affect the quality of classroom instruction and student achievement.</p>
<p>Educators from schools, colleges, universities, and educational organizations around the Monterey Bay will attend the conference. MBEC co-chairs George R. Blumenthal, acting chancellor of UCSC, and Dianne Harrison, president of California State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB), will welcome participants.</p>
<p>A morning panel moderated by Cabrillo College President Brian King will focus on teacher recruitment and retention. Panel participants include Rodney Ogawa, professor of education and chair of the Education Department at UCSC; Betty Achinstein of the UCSC New Teacher Center (NTC); John Ittelson professor of information technology and communications design at CSUMB; and Louis Denti, distinguished professor in special education at CSUMB.</p>
<p>An afternoon panel moderated by Santa Cruz County Superintendent of Schools Michael Watkins will discuss math, science, special education, and the needs of English language learners. Participants will include Bartlett, Gretchen Andreasen, a resource center director with the California Teach Program at UCSC; Edward Landesman with the UC Office of the President; Judit Moschkovich, associate professor of education at UCSC; Jerome Shaw, assistant professor of education at UCSC; and George Bunch, assistant professor of education at UCSC.</p>
<p>Following each panel presentation, participants will form smaller moderated breakout sessions for further discussion and problem solving. Monterey County Superintendent of Schools Nancy Kotowski will provide a wrap-up of the day before EPC Executive Director Moran offers closing remarks. A full schedule is available online at</p>

The center will allow researchers to perform up to 30,000 experiments per day as they test chemical compounds for usefulness in fighting disease or understanding fundamental aspects of a cell's life. A half-day symposium and reception will mark the opening day.</p>
<p>The screening center will be shared by UCSC faculty in the Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry; Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology; and Environmental Toxicology. Researchers will use its six robots and library of 55,000 compounds to study cancer, malaria, Parkinson's disease, cholera, and the mechanics of inflammation, among other ailments. Additional projects include studies of cell division, DNA transcription, and the ways in which genes regulate cell life.</p>
<p>The $500,000 center gives an enormous boost to UCSC's capability in the field of high-throughput screening. "It's where robotics meets biotechnology," said Scott Lokey, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry and lead investigator of the center. "We harness the ability of robots to do thousands of tedious manipulations in parallel, so we can focus on analyzing data."</p>
<p>Scientists searching for new disease treatments have an embarrassment of riches, Lokey said. Hundreds of thousands of chemical compounds look promising on paper. But with so many possibilities, testing each compound's activity against a welter of diseases, metabolic pathways, and reaction conditions can quickly fill up a lifetime's to-do list.</p>
<p>The answer is automation. "We're sort of taking the shotgun approach," Lokey said. "We throw tens of thousands of compounds at a problem until we find one that hits."</p>
<p>The new center consists of six robots. Three act as steady-handed lab technicians that unerringly handle tiny droplets of chemicals down to one-tenth of a microliter, or about four millionths of a fluid ounce. Needles flit across a plate containing 384 pen-cap-sized reaction wells, adding a variety of solutions to eight wells at a time. An automated stacker hovers over the machine holding another 49 plates, each awaiting the same treatment.</p>
<p>A fourth machine handles cleanup between reaction steps. The fifth and sixth measure experimental results by either detecting a light signal or recording an image through an automated 60-power microscope. Image-recognition software then identifies basic characteristics of the cell's life cycle and assembles preliminary results overnight to greet the researcher in the morning.</p>
<p>The new devices mark a huge improvement over the old method, Lokey said, which included manual equipment and a used machine that a pharmaceutical company had donated years earlier.</p>
<p>"We were doing 10 plates in a day, maximum, and it was very painful," he said. "And the way we were doing it led to a lot of inaccuracies because it was so tedious. With robots, you have a lot of inherent reproducibility in the manipulations that you don't have when you're doing it all by hand. Now you can put in 50 plates, come back after a cup of coffee, and have your compounds added. It lowers the barrier for biologists who want to do screening."</p>
<p>Drug companies routinely use high-throughput screening to test perhaps a million samples per day, Lokey said. Although the UCSC center is smaller, it's not as concerned with sheer volume.</p>
<p>"Instead of focusing on finding a blockbuster drug, we can be a bit more broad and discover compounds that could be used for basic research as well," Lokey said. "We are also going after infectious diseases like malaria and cholera that are still big health issues in the developing world. Drug companies have tended to shy away from these diseases, and it's up to academic screening centers to pick up the slack."</p>
<p>The diversity of research being performed at UCSC helps accomplish the center's broader goals. For example, typical drug discovery centers often focus on synthetic chemicals that are easy to produce and to modify; Lokey has a freezer full of more than 40,000 synthetic compounds to choose from when conducting analyses.</p>
<p>Added to this number are naturally occurring products with very different chemical structures and properties, compounds that have been painstakingly collected and purified by the research teams of Phil Crews, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and Roger Linington, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry.</p>
<p>"About half of all drugs on the market come from natural sources," Lokey said. "Plants and many marine organisms have this uncanny ability to create diversity and complexity in terms of the molecules they produce. These molecules are much, much more complex and interesting from a chemical point of view than synthetic compounds. We've got two world-class natural-products chemists right down the hall from us, and we're hoping our work together will stimulate a lot of new discoveries."</p>
<p>Over several decades of work with marine sponges, Crews has compiled a screening library of 1,000 natural compounds that are unlike the substances produced in any other organisms. The UCSC group also has plans to collaborate with natural-products chemists at the Eijkman Institute of Indonesia and the Russian Academy of Sciences, among others.</p>

<p>The symposium will begin at 2:30 p.m., September 21, in room 240 of the Physical Sciences Building on the UCSC campus. A keynote address at 3 p.m. by Professor Jim Wells of the Small Molecule Discovery Center at UC San Francisco will be followed with a tour and ribbon cutting at the new center. A reception and scientific poster session will be held in the building's atrium.</p>
<p>The Chemical Screening Center was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of State, and the California Institute for Quantitative Biomedical Research.</p>
<p>In addition to Lokey, Crews, and Linington, other UCSC professors using the new center include Manuel Ares, Jr., professor of molecular, cell, and developmental (MCD) biology; Grant Hartzog, associate professor of MCD biology; Ted Holman, professor of chemistry and biochemistry; Tony Fink, professor of chemistry and biochemistry; Melissa Jurica, assistant professor of MCD biology; Douglas Kellogg, professor of MCD biology; John Tamkun, professor of MCD biology; Karen Ottemann, associate professor of environmental toxicology; and Fitnat Yildiz, assistant professor of environmental toxicology.</p>

Dominy.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>To think that world domination could have begun in the cheeks. That's one interpretation of a discovery, published online September 9 in <em>Nature Genetics,</em> which indicates that humans carry extra copies of the salivary amylase gene.</p>
<p>Humans have many more copies of this gene than any of their ape relatives, the study found, and they use the copies to flood their mouths with amylase, an enzyme that digests starch. The finding bolsters the idea that starch was a crucial addition to the diet of early humans, and that natural selection favored individuals who could make more starch-digesting protein.</p>
<p>"Extra gene copies are an easy way for evolution to ramp up expression of a protein," said Nathaniel Dominy, assistant professor of anthropology at University of California, Santa Cruz, and one of the paper's authors. "Why wait for chance mutations to improve gene function? Natural selection can favor duplicate copies of a gene that already works well, and enzyme production will increase."</p>
<p>Other primates eat mainly ripe fruits containing very little starch. A new ability to supplement the diet with calorie-rich starches could have fed our large brains and opened up new food supplies that fueled our unrivaled colonization of the planet, Dominy said.</p>
<p>The researchers sampled saliva from 50 European-American undergraduates and found as many as 15 copies of the amylase gene per person. By comparison, all 15 chimpanzees they sampled had exactly two copies each. Students with more copies of the gene also had higher concentrations of the enzyme in their spit.</p>
<p>Next, the team studied groups of humans with differing diets. They found a similar correspondence between the amount of starch in a group's diet and the average number of amylase gene copies its individuals possessed. For example, the Yakut of the Arctic, whose traditional diet centers around fish, had fewer copies than the related Japanese, whose diet includes starchy foods like rice, Dominy said. The same pattern existed for two Tanzanian tribes--the Datog, who raise livestock, and the Hadza, who primarily gather tubers and roots.</p>
<p>"Even though they're closely related genetically and live close to each other geographically, still there are big differences in the average number of copies in these populations," Dominy said. "So we felt like geography and relatedness are not driving these differences. It's got to be diet."</p>
<p>For Dominy and his coauthors, the finding goes beyond the mouth. In pondering human origins, Dominy said, anthropologists have long been stumped by the sudden, nearly simultaneous increases in our brain size, body size, and geographic range, while other apes changed little. Early humans simply must have found some source of better nutrition to make it all possible, they reasoned.</p>
<p>"That's the big mystery of paleoanthropology," Dominy said. "What changed? Why did our earliest human ancestors deviate from the pattern we see in living apes to evolve this incredibly large brain, which is very energetically expensive to maintain, and to become a much more efficient bipedal organism?"</p>
<p>For years, the answer was thought to be the growing importance of meat in the diet, as early humans learned to hunt. But, Dominy pointed out, "Even when you look at modern human hunter-gatherers, meat is a relatively small fraction of their diet. They cooperate with language, use nets; they have poisoned arrows, even, and still it's not that easy to hunt meat. To think that, two to four million years ago, a small-brained, awkwardly bipedal animal could efficiently acquire meat, even by scavenging, just doesn't make a whole lot of sense."</p>
<p>Some anthropologists have begun to suspect the new source of food consisted of starches, stored by plants in the form of underground tubers and bulbs--wild versions of modern-day foods like carrots, potatoes, and onions. Once early humans learned to recognize tuber-forming plants, they opened up a food source unknown to other apes.</p>
<p>"It's kind of a goldmine," Dominy said. "All you have to do is dig it up."</p>
<p>Tubers may have been especially critical for the first widely successful humans, known as <em>Homo erectus,</em> who may have learned to cook with fire. Since this idea was proposed, about a decade ago, researchers have been looking for evidence to support or refute it--no easy task for a theory that concerns highly perishable food consumed two million years ago. But in work earlier this year, Dominy and his colleagues found that animals eating tubers and bulbs produce body tissues with an isotopic signature that matches what has been measured in early fossilized humans (see earlier <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1251">press release</a>).</p>
<p>The new discovery is a separate line of evidence pointing to the importance of starch in human beginnings, Dominy said. When early humans mastered fire, cooking starchy vegetables would have made them even easier to eat, he added. At the same time it would have made extra amylase gene copies an even more valuable trait.</p>
<p>"We roast tubers, and we eat French fries and baked potatoes," Dominy said. "When you cook, you can afford to eat less overall, because the food is easier to digest. Some marginal food resource that you might only eat in times of famine, now you can cook it and eat it. Now you can have population growth and expand into new territories."</p>
<p>Dominy's coauthors include George Perry, Katrina Claw, John Werner, Rajeev Misra, and Anne Stone of Arizona State University; Arthur Lee and Charles Lee of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Mass.; Heike Fiegler, Richard Redon, and Nigel Carter of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton, UK; Fernando Villanea, a former graduate fellow at UCSC who is now at the University of Costa Rica; and Joanna Mountain of Stanford University.</p>

Acting on the recommendation of President Robert C. Dynes, the UC Board of Regents appointed Blumenthal the tenth chancellor of UC Santa Cruz during the board's meeting in Davis. The selection culminates a five-month, nationwide search that attracted more than 550 prospective candidates.<br/>
<br/>
<p>Blumenthal has been serving as acting chancellor for the past 14 months, following the death in June 2006 of Chancellor Denice D. Denton.</p>
<p>"In naming George Blumenthal to this important position, we are choosing a person who has contributed significantly to UCSC's richly deserved reputation for producing world-class research and student-focused instruction," Dynes said. "George Blumenthal's thoughtful, collegial and constructive leadership style will solidify UCSC's stature as one of the premier research universities in the nation."</p>
<p>"I am deeply honored by this appointment to lead a campus so distinctive and effective in fulfilling its mission," said Blumenthal. "UCSC has a bold vision and superb programs. Our students are outstanding, and our faculty are exceptional scholars committed to giving students uncommon learning and research opportunities. I will proudly work with the campus community, our accomplished alumni, and the many communities we serve to continue UCSC's upward trajectory."</p>
<p>During Blumenthal's tenure as acting chancellor, he united the campus community after the death of Chancellor Denton, presided over the development of a new campus academic plan, effectively reached out to Santa Cruz leaders and neighborhood groups concerned about UCSC's projected growth, strengthened ties to Silicon Valley's business and higher education communities, and broadened external support for UC Santa Cruz (the campus' endowment exceeded the $100 million-milestone during Blumenthal's tenure as acting chancellor).</p>
<p>Blumenthal, 61, has been a UC Santa Cruz faculty member since 1972 with a research focus on theoretical astrophysics. His work spans subjects ranging from gamma ray bursts, compact X-ray sources, and active galactic nuclei to cosmology, and the origin of structure in the Universe. He helped lead the way in developing the "cold dark matter theory" of galaxy formation, which has over the last 20 years become the standard paradigm for how structure forms in the Universe.</p>
<p>As one of the first generation in his family to attend college, Blumenthal earned his B.S. degree from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and his Ph.D. in physics from UC San Diego. He is the co-author of one of the leading astronomy textbooks, 21st Century Astronomy.</p>
<p>In addition to his distinguished scholarship, Blumenthal has broad experience as an academic leader both at UC Santa Cruz and within the University of California system. He served as chair of the UC Academic Senate for the 2004-05 year. He was the faculty representative to the UC Regents from 2003 to 2005. In these statewide roles, Blumenthal's leadership helped change UC's eligibility criteria to meet UC's mandate to provide access to the top 12.5 percent of high school graduates and enhance the ability of community college students to transfer to UC.</p>
<p>He also chaired the UC Santa Cruz Division of the Academic Senate from 2001 to 2003, and twice previously chaired the campus's world-renowned Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. He also served on the campus' Silicon Valley Initiative task force, which established the vision for UC Santa Cruz's engagement and activities in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Blumenthal is a founding faculty member of Oakes College, one of UCSC's 10 residential colleges; Oakes, which is committed to serving students from diverse backgrounds, emphasizes multicultural approaches to its "living and learning" activities.</p>
<p>He has been an aggressive champion of diversity, both as a member of the Regents' Study Group on Diversity (on which he serves as chair of the working group on diversity in graduate and professional schools) and in pushing a number of new campus initiatives, including the creation of the first-ever Chancellor's Advisory Council on Diversity.</p>
<p>"George Blumenthal's success as acting chancellor presages an extraordinarily successful chancellorship," said UC Board of Regents chairman Richard C. Blum. "He has demonstrated he has the talent and skills, the respect of the campus and the community, and the support of the Regents to help write an exciting new chapter in the history of a unique and important campus in the University of California system."</p>
<p>In addition to serving as chancellor, Blumenthal will continue to hold his faculty appointment at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>He is married to Kelly Weisberg, a professor of law at UC Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco. They have two children.</p>

The pilot program in nine states supports 150 beginning secondary math teachers. Support for the program was provided by a $500,000 grant from the Goldman Sachs Foundation.</p><p>By creating a new national online network, the Electronic Mentoring for Student Success (eMSS) program has established a content-focused professional development community for beginning math teachers. Novice teachers receive one-on-one mentoring from a veteran teacher in their state; pairs are established based on course content and grade level. In addition, curriculum that focuses on math content and pedagogy is available in a larger online community where teachers share case studies, lesson plans, and common challenges. The network also provides access to expert mathematics content specialists, allowing teachers to deepen their knowledge in the field. </p><p>The New Teacher Center (NTC) plans to offer the eMSS for Mathematics program to additional school districts following the successful conclusion of the pilot program. The new program is modeled on the eMSS for Science program that the NTC developed in partnership with the National Science Teacher Association and Montana State University. Originally launched in 2002, the science program now includes more than 425 mentors and 500 new teachers throughout the country. </p><p>"We are excited about this opportunity to expand our professional development support to new mathematics teachers," said Ellen Moir, executive director of the NTC. "We believe that we can reduce teacher turnover and improve student achievement by providing an environment where new teachers receive discipline-specific tools coupled with personal mentoring. This award helps us offer dedicated and enthusiastic new teachers the support they need to thrive."</p><p>"Improving mathematics education is critical for all students," said Stephanie Bell-Rose, president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation. "We identified the New Teacher Center at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and their eMSS online mentoring program as the ideal partner to help us advance achievement in mathematics, especially in hard-to-staff districts that serve underrepresented students." </p><p>#####</p><p><b>About The Goldman Sachs Foundation:</b> The Goldman Sachs Foundation is a global philanthropic organization funded by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

<p>Electronic Workflow is a CruzPay system function that allows employees and supervisors to submit and approve timesheets online, with no need to print paper copies. For most employees using CruzPay the only change will be eliminating the Custom Timesheet Report print step. Employees and supervisors will continue to have the option of printing a Custom Timesheet Report for personal records.</p>
<p>We successfully phased in small groups of employees throughout the summer, and are now ready to roll out this new functionality to all CruzPay users.</p>
<p>This will happen during September and October 2007, with approximately half of the campus units transitioning for September time reporting, and the rest for October time reporting.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://cruzpay.ucsc.edu">cruzpay.ucsc.edu</a> for a listing of the units and employees using Electronic Workflow beginning in September or October. Employees and supervisors will also be notified individually via UCSC e-mail in the appropriate month with instructions on how to electronically submit and approve timesheets.</p>
<p>Academic supervisors of staff employees will also use CruzPay to approve those employees' timesheets. Additional information will also be provided via UCSC e-mail to academic supervisors regarding their use of CruzPay.</p>

The new phones, easily identified by their tall rectangular shape, are part of an ongoing effort to improve the safety and security of students, faculty, and staff--especially those who are on campus during evenings and weekends. The new phones bring the total number of blue light phones on campus to 54.</p><p>Each large parking lot (West Remote, North Remote, Hahn, and East Remote) now has three new blue light phones, located at the entrance, center, and back of each lot. In addition, there are phones at the Cowell bus stop (near Quarry Plaza) and the Oakes bus stop (near the lower College Eight parking lot). The Core West Parking Structure has three older style emergency phones on each parking level, at the east and west ends, as well as at the middle stairwell near Baskin Engineering.) </p><p>An <a href="http://emergency.ucsc.edu/bluelight.html">online map</a> of the new locations is now available at the campus emergency web site.</p><p>The phones are activated by pressing the large "emergency" button; the caller will be automatically connected to the campus Dispatch Center. At the same time, a high-intensity strobe light at the top of the phone will activate, providing a beacon for police officers to locate the person in distress. </p><p>For more information about emergency procedures on campus, visit <a href="http://emergency.ucsc.edu">emergency.ucsc.edu</a> or contact Chris Gaylord at (831) 459-2342.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9153195b8072704601a012ffe3e92396"><name>1577</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Vice Chancellor for Information Technology finalists to make presentations</title><start-date>1190271600000</start-date><display-name>Vice Chancellor for Information...</display-name><path>/2007/09/1577</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/09/1577</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338396457</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338396457</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The search committee for the Vice Chancellor, Information Technology (VCIT) has identified three finalists for the position.

These funds provide crucial support for everything from improved teaching in the nation's classrooms to a state-of-the-art automated planet-finder telescope. Donors also created new endowed faculty positions in four areas of study.</p><p>"Every gift enhances our ability to educate students and seek solutions to the challenges facing the world," said UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal. "This impressive level of commitment will make a tremendous difference throughout UC Santa Cruz. We are enormously grateful to our many donors for supporting our academic initiatives as well as our service to the wider community." </p><p>UCSC's program to help public schools across the nation retain new teachers in the profession received an especially strong vote of confidence, raising nearly $8 million. The New Teacher Center received its largest grant from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, which gave $3.8 million to advance the center's work. The New Teacher Center collaborates with school districts in more than 30 states to improve retention and instruction for beginning teachers, and recently has extended its assistance to school principals. Other major supporters included the Carnegie Foundation, the Morgan Family Foundation, the James Irvine Foundation, the Joyce Foundation, the Lloyd A. Fry Foundation, the Stupski Foundation, the Payne Family Foundation, and the MetLife Foundation. </p><p>Looking far beyond the classroom, the Gloria and Kenneth Levy Foundation provided $600,000 to help fund an integral part of the Automated Planet Finder Telescope-a state-of-the-art spectrometer now being built at Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton. Lick Observatory is one of two ground-based observatories operated by the University of California Observatories (UCO). Headquartered on the UC Santa Cruz campus, UCO is also managing partner of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The new telescope will collect starlight, directing it into the spectrometer, bringing within reach the goal of discovering Earth-sized planets in other solar systems.</p><p>Donors also showed a strong commitment to supporting faculty by establishing endowed funds for faculty positions, increasing the number of such funds to 23. The new endowed positions are the Jack Baskin Endowed Chair in Technology and Information Management; the Peggy Downes Baskin Endowed Humanities Chair for Interdisciplinary Studies in Ethics; the Jean H. Langenheim Endowed Chair in Plant Ecology and Evolution; and the Sarabjit Singh Aurora Endowed Chair in Sikh and Punjabi Studies. </p><p>In addition, $2.27 million was raised through Annual Giving programs, including more than $509,424 from alumni. Alumni also contributed $182,881 in reunion giving. Trustees of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, which supports the campus through advocacy and private fundraising efforts, gave $1.4 million. UCSC students helped raised an additional $549,605 by reaching out to alumni and parents through the student-run Telephone Outreach Program, in which donors direct their contributions to specific campus needs.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91531c8b8072704601a012ff82202522"><name>1579</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Appointment of UCSC Chancellor</title><start-date>1190185200000</start-date><display-name>Appointment of UCSC Chancellor...</display-name><path>/2007/09/1579</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/09/1579</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338397268</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338397268</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>George R.

The first day of instruction in the fall quarter is Thursday, September 27. The fall-quarter "move-in" for students living on campus was scheduled to continue through Sunday, September 23.</p><p>Here are some facts and figures about this year's new students, new academic programs the campus is offering, and new buildings that are under construction. </p><p><b>Freshman Class:</b></p><p>UCSC's new freshman class, which is projected to include about 3,750 students, will be the most diverse entering class ever. About one-quarter (25.8 percent) of the incoming freshmen identified themselves as African American, Chicano, Latino, or American Indian, and another quarter (25.4 percent) identified themselves as Asian/Asian American. This is the largest percentage of underrepresented freshmen ever at UCSC. </p><p>More than 65 percent of the freshmen have declared a major. The most popular majors among the incoming freshmen include biology (201 students), business management economics (246 students), and psychology (252 students). Another 221 students are expected to enroll in engineering majors. The average grade-point average (G.P.A.) of admitted freshmen is 3.69.</p><p>About 31 percent of new freshmen come from the Bay Area/Northern California, while another 37 percent come from Southern California.</p><p><b>Transfer Students:</b></p><p>The new students projected to enroll at UCSC this year include about 825 transfer students.

The projects include:</p><p><b>McHenry Library Expansion:</b> After 10 years of planning, the McHenry Library Addition and Renovation Project took a giant step toward reality as construction began two years ago. The expanded and renovated McHenry Library will provide increased space to better serve library users. The project, scheduled for completion in 2009, will provide the campus with an outstanding, architecturally designed building in a setting of terraced reading gardens, redwoods, and cherry trees.</p><p><b>Digital Arts Building:</b> Grading of the site has begun and the building is scheduled for completion in May 2009. Located near the Elena Baskin Visual Arts Center, the state-funded $25 million arts building is slated to house the expanding digital arts program as well as to provide 10 studios for art faculty, a photography studio, and expanded space for music and theater arts classes.</p><p><b>Ranch View Terrace:</b> Site preparation work is under way on the Ranch View Terrace project, which will provide 45 single-family homes in its first phase. The three- and four-bedroom homes will be located in the southern section of campus, adjacent to the Arboretum, and south of the Farm and Garden. The site has the capacity to include an additional 39 homes in subsequent phases. The first units are expected to be available for occupancy in the fall of 2008.</p><p>For more information about these and other projects, please go to: <a href="http://construction.ucsc.edu">construction.ucsc.edu</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915321248072704601a012ffdb6afe6c"><name>1583</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Quentin Williams appointed chair of UCSC Academic Senate</title><summary>Quentin Williams, professor of Earth and planetary sciences, has been appointed chair of UCSC's Academic Senate.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Quentin Williams</keywords><description>Quentin Williams, professor of Earth and planetary sciences, has been appointed chair of UCSC's Academic Senate.</description><start-date>1190617200000</start-date><display-name>Quentin Williams appointed chair...</display-name><path>/2007/09/1583</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/09/1583</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338398429</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338398429</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Appointments</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/09/images/williams.105.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/09/images/williams.105.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>williams.105.jpg</name><file-size>40712</file-size><width>105</width><height>121</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Quentin Williams</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Quentin Williams, professor of Earth and planetary sciences, has been appointed chair of UCSC's Academic Senate, effective September 1.

(Photo: Karin Higgins)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As the news of George Blumenthal's appointment as chancellor spread across campus Wednesday, cheers erupted in hallways, high-fives were exchanged, and the campus rejoiced at the selection.</p><p> </p><p>In Kerr Hall, about 30 staff members from several units, including the Chancellor's Office, took a break and gathered in a conference room to listen to the audio broadcast of the UC Regents meeting. The Regents voted to approve Blumenthal's selection Wednesday afternoon, and when the vote was announced, the celebrations began.</p><p> </p><p>"It was a lot of fun--there was clapping, shouting, and high-fives," said Paula Towle, manager of the Chancellor's Office. "There was a lot of joy. It's just thrilling."</p><p> </p><p>During the busy lunch hour in Terra Fresca Restaurant at University Center, a woman shouted the news across the room after receiving a text message. "She held up her phone and shouted, 'It's George!,' " recalled Liz Sandoval, director of development for the Humanities Division. "It was so cute--everyone started holding up their phones, and people were shouting across the room. It was a big celebration. People were very happy."</p><p> </p><p>Earlier in the day, librarians monitoring the web cast of the Regents meeting heard UC Regents Chair Richard Blum inadvertently leak the news when he referred to the pending announcement of Blumenthal's appointment. "They rushed in to tell me, and there was a lot of excitement," said University Librarian Virginia Steel. "People were really pleased. The campus has had an opportunity to work with George for 14 months, and we have a lot of respect for him. People feel he's just part of UCSC."</p><p> </p><p>Prior to his appointment, Blumenthal served as acting chancellor following the death in June 2006 of Chancellor Denice Denton.</p><p> </p><p>Economics professor Lori Kletzer was in her office when she learned the news via email and promptly joined colleagues in the hallway. "Everybody was pleased," said Kletzer. "We are all very lucky. We're ready to move forward."</p><p> </p><p>Connie Croker, a library budget analyst and a new member of the Staff Advisory Board, said she, too, was thrilled by the news. "It's exciting, because people really wanted it to happen," she said. "I heard on the bus that there was dancing in the Psychology Department. And I know the Staff Advisory Board is really looking forward to working with George Blumenthal."</p><p> </p><p>Faculty from every academic discipline embraced the news of Blumenthal's appointment, according to Academic Senate Chair Quentin Williams, a professor of Earth sciences. "I've talked to a lot of faculty, and people are ecstatic," said Williams. "To some extent, the news was anticipated and hoped for, but you never know until it happens. Now we'll hit the ground running. This is a chance for us to really move forward on achieving our promise and potential."</p><p> </p><p>Underscoring Williams' comments, theater arts professor Kathy Foley was beaming as she said, "People in the arts and humanities have been acting, praying, singing, and dancing that someone such as George would represent us!"</p><p> </p><p>Ted Holman, associate professor of chemistry, expressed the sentiments of many when he said the news was welcome on "two levels," because Blumenthal is "a known quantity, and he's a great guy."</p><p> </p><p>Social Sciences Dean Sheldon Kamieniecki said he looks forward to building on the campus's recent efforts to raise its profile and increase fundraising. "We did fairly well under unstable conditions, and I think the collective feeling now is, 'My goodness, what can we do with stable conditions?' " he said.</p><p> </p><p>By Friday morning, Blumenthal had received 250 email messages from well-wishers across the country and abroad. "My wife and I got home last night and had 15 phone messages on the machine," said Blumenthal, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics who joined the UCSC faculty 1972 "To be honest, I'm a bit uncomfortable when it's all about me. I prefer it when it's all about the campus, but it has been very heartwarming. I must say, it's been heartwarming."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915324938072704601a012ff849c6842"><name>1585</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Check before you dial: '502' phone prefix expanding</title><summary>Beginning June 2007, campus phone numbers with the prefix "502" will be assigned to newly hired faculty and staff e.g., (831) 502-1234.</summary><keywords>prefix, telephone, numbers</keywords><description>Beginning June 2007, campus phone numbers with the prefix "502" will be assigned to newly hired faculty and staff e.g., (831) 502-1234.</description><start-date>1190617200000</start-date><display-name>Check before you dial:...</display-name><path>/2007/09/1585</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/09/1585</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338399322</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338399322</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Campus phone numbers with the prefix "502" are being assigned to newly hired faculty and staff e.g., (831) 502-1234.</p><p>The campus also assigns phone numbers that begin with the "502" prefix to student residences.

<p>Beaty portrays a cast of 40 characters--including a homeless man, a scientist, a Republican business executive, and an 11-year-old boy from the projects--who all react to the phenomenon of a slave ship suddenly rising out of the Hudson River in front of the Statue of Liberty in 2006.</p>
<p>Utilizing a surprisingly fresh and quirky approach that includes slam poetry, satire, and song, Beaty offers a stirring commentary on modern black life, as he explores what centuries of slavery have done to the pysche of humanity.</p>
<p>In a National Public Radio interview recently aired on <em>All Things Considered</em>, Beaty said he views his play as "a whole community on stage," adding, "there are so many residual feelings and emotions and issues from the experience of slavery--you can be wealthy, working in corporate America, or you could be living in the projects, and still have some of those issues haunting you."</p>
<p>Described by <em>New York Magazine</em> as "funnier than most serious plays and vastly smarter than most funny plays," <em>Emergence-See!</em> was honored in May with a 2007 Village Voice Obie Award--the Off-Broadway equivalent of a Tony Award--for Outstanding Writing and Performance.</p>
<p>Beaty has performed throughout the U.S., Europe, and Africa including appearances at The White House, The Kennedy Center, on HBO's <em>Russell Simmons Presents Def Poetry</em>, and The Apollo Theater. His work has been showcased at such venues as The Public Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM), New York Theater Workshop, La Mama, American Conservatory Theater, Yale University, and The NAACP National Convention. Beatty is also the 2004 Grand Slam Champion at the world famous Nuyorican Poets CafÃ©.</p>
<p><em>Emergence-See!</em> is just the first in a series of 16 shows to be presented by UCSC's Arts &amp; Lectures in the 2007-08 season. Upcoming events this fall will include performances by Grammy Award-winning violinist Hilary Hahn, Oct. 17; Ravi and Anoushka Shankar, Nov. 4; renowned Brazilian guitarist/songwriter Caetano Veloso, Nov. 16; and Senegalese vocalist Youssou N'Dour, Nov. 28.</p>
<p>The season opener also marks the first show for new Arts &amp; Lectures director Jeanette Pilak, who said she is greatly anticipating the wide range of performances that UCSC will offer throughout the coming year.</p>
<p>"In a world where we get our 'news' from <em>The Daily Show</em> and our entertainment from YouTube, I am eager to experience the thought-provoking work of Daniel Beaty's <em>Emergence-See!</em>," Pilak noted. "I expect to be re-invigorated by the efforts of this 30-something artist, whose passion has created a work I hope all of Santa Cruz will experience."</p>

<p>"Here at UC Santa Cruz, our faculty are making breakthroughs relentlessly. Our students are exploring new ideas and opportunities at a pace they've never before experienced. Our graduates are changing the world. Our programs are defining education and reshaping the future," said Blumenthal, who received two enthusiastic standing ovations from the capacity crowd in the Music Center Recital Hall.</p>

Blumenthal called the campus "a place that fosters a culture of excellence, inquiry, creativity, diversity, and public service while developing solutions to the world's most critical challenges." He pledged to work together with faculty, students, staff, alumni, community members, government officials, and campus supporters to "accelerate UCSC's upward trajectory."<br/>
<br/>
<p>Blumenthal delivered his address on Monday, September 24, after being formally presented by UC President Robert Dynes. "This is a day of celebration," said Dynes, who began the custom of introducing new chancellors when he took office in 2003. "Usually, I talk about how well the new chancellor will fit into the culture of the campus," he said, acknowledging that there was no need for that this time. "George was the best we found, and he was here at home." (See <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1566">appointment press release</a>.)</p>
<p>Noting milestones in fundraising and other areas reached during Blumenthal's 14-month tenure as acting chancellor, Dynes said, "Imagine what he's going to do as your permanent chancellor. I can hardly wait."</p>
<p>Earlier, Michael Brown, chair of the UC Academic Senate and a professor of counseling/clinical/school psychology in the Graduate School of Education at UC Santa Barbara, said the campus feels poised for greatness. He summed up the sentiments of many when he said, "You can just feel things ready to take off."</p>
<p>Blumenthal, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics, spoke of his long personal connection with UCSC. He recalled his experience arriving at UCSC 35 years ago as a "very young assistant professor" and joining the "community of scholars," where faculty reach out across disciplines and learn from each other. That interdisciplinary spirit energizes the teaching and research environment of UCSC, which he called a "place born of innovation."</p>
<p>He cited the accomplishments of UCSC graduates, as well as the work of faculty from a range of disciplines, and he briefly outlined the campus's new academic plan. Calling the campus "a place utterly unlike any other," Blumenthal said UCSC will remain dedicated to undergraduates even as graduate programs grow, and he renewed his commitment to campus sustainability efforts.</p>
<p>The UCSC community is made up of "rebels and visionaries. . . people who think. People who care. Care enough to act. To give themselves to the world. And to change it."</p>
<p>"I am honored to be standing with you," he said.</p>

Photo by Jenn Yost.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A new survey has determined that the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum's collection of eucalyptus trees and shrubs is the most diverse anywhere outside of Australia. The finding is the result of an inventory conducted this summer by Matt Ritter, a visiting scholar at the Arboretum. Ritter is assistant professor of biological sciences at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and director of the Cal Poly Plant Conservatory.</p><p>Initial investigations led Ritter to declare the UCSC eucalyptus collection the largest in California, but he upgraded his assessment as he continued his work cataloging the collection. The project led him 100 feet into the air to sample leaves and flowers from towering eucalyptus trees. At first he worked from a cherry-picker truck, but when the lift topped out short of the lowest branches on some trees, Ritter and Cal Poly graduate student Jenn Yost turned to ropes and harnesses.</p><p>For most Californians, the word eucalyptus brings to mind the hulking blue gum trees that line many coastal highways. But more than 300 other species have been introduced to the state, Ritter said. About 100 of those grow in the UCSC Arboretum, and some species don't grow anywhere else in the state, he added.</p><p>Highlights of the Arboretum collection, Ritter said, include the oldest spinning gum in the state and two karri trees that, at nearly 200 feet high, are likely the tallest in the state. A whipstick mallee ash is probably the only tree of its kind in California, he said. This information is from a forthcoming article by Ritter in the <i>Bulletin of the UCSC Arboretum Associates.</i></p><p>When it comes to eucalyptus, the UCSC Arboretum's closest competitors are botanical gardens in the Los Angeles area and at UC Davis, Ritter said. California's climate, which closely matches that of the trees' home range in Australia, is the key to their success here. In many other parts of the world, the trees just can't handle the weather. </p><p>Some eucalyptus species--notably the blue gums--have become pests that crowd out native California vegetation, said Stephen McCabe, director of education at the Arboretum. During his time at the Arboretum, Ritter examined which eucalyptus species are capable of reproducing in California, as a way to investigate which of them might become pests. Ritter identified 10 species whose seeds had begun to grow in the grove and which might be better left out of other California nurseries, McCabe said.</p><p>Over the next few months, Ritter plans to install larger labels throughout the collection and to plant appropriate understory plants. When he's finished, he hopes the eucalyptus grove will provide visitors an authentic Australian forest experience. </p><p>The Arboretum's eucalyptus collection was started by UCSC's first chancellor, Dean McHenry. Chosen from 80 species donated by Max Watson, the first plantings were made in summer 1965 by forestry students from Cabrillo College as UCSC prepared for its first year of operation. By 1970, the eucalyptus collection tallied 160 trees of 56 varieties.</p><p>The Arboretum is already known for having the largest assemblage of Australian plants outside of Australia. The Arboretum's collections of other, slightly more obscure plant groups may also be unrivaled outside of Australia, including the Arboretum's more than 150 <i>Grevillea</i> and 40 <i>Banksia</i> species. </p><p>Ritter's work builds on that of a previous researcher, Grace Heinz, who was sponsored in her work by Donald and Diane Cooley. Additional species have been collected since Heinz's work at the grove in the 1970s.</p><p>The Arboretum is located off High Street in Santa Cruz. It is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily and can be reached at (831) 427-2998. The gift shop is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily.

Photo by Tim Stephens</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California, Santa Cruz, and Zipcar, North America's largest on-campus car-sharing service, have formed a joint partnership to provide Zipcars to campus faculty, staff, and students, as well as community residents, as an environmentally friendly alternative to the costs and hassles of keeping a car on campus. The partnership continues UCSC's commitment to provide sustainable transportation options that decrease the parking demand on campus and reduce traffic impacts on the community, and grows Zipcar's on-campus programs to more than 50 university partners.</p>
<p>Beginning today, seven self-service Zipcars--three Toyota Prius Hybrids, two Honda Elements, a Mazda 3 and a Toyota Matrix--will be available for use 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The cars will be located on the main campus at the OPERS parking lot by the East Field House and at the upper College 8 parking lot, as well as off campus at UCSC's 2300 Delaware Avenue site and downtown to serve the University Town Center at Cathcart and Cedar Streets.</p>
<p>"This partnership with Zipcar enables us to offer car sharing conveniently on campus to all of our students at low rates. It is a natural fit with both our environmental initiatives and our desire to decrease parking demand and traffic impacts," said Larry Pageler, director of UCSC's Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS). "The program complements UCSC's existing alternative transportation program and will allow our students the mobility they need to travel off campus for shopping, errands, and recreation without the need to bring their personal cars to the area. Car sharing also gives TAPS the opportunity to introduce the Santa Cruz community to another viable, sustainable transportation program."</p>
<p>Studies by Zipcar have shown that their car-sharing programs have many "green" benefits to campuses and local communities. Each Zipcar typically replaces up to 20 personally owned vehicles, reducing the need for additional parking spaces and replacing older vehicles with new ones that have more stringent pollution controls. Zipcar members tend to drive significantly less, resulting in less congestion and fewer greenhouse gas emissions. Members tend to use a variety of alternative modes and use Zipcar only when they need to.</p>
<p>Car sharing is a natural complement to the variety of sustainable transportation programs already provided by UC Santa Cruz. According to Pageler, almost 60 percent of all trips to campus are made in modes other than a single-occupant vehicle. More than 10,000 trips are made to campus via its extensive transit program each day. In addition, approximately 220 campus affiliates travel to and from campus in the 20 vanpools coming from San Jose, Monterey, Aptos and other locations. Many students, staff, and faculty have formed both formal and informal carpools, while many more walk or ride their bikes to campus. These efforts have enabled the campus to reduce its vehicle trips through the campus entrances by more than 10 percent, matching 1999-2000 levels, even though student enrollment has increased by 37 percent during the same time period.</p>
<p>The Zipcar car sharing program will help these other programs continue to grow. By offering access to a vehicle on the occasions when one is needed, car sharing encourages people to adopt alternative modes of transportation, rather than bringing their own car to campus.</p>
<p>Membership in the Zipcar program is available for $35 to all UCSC students 18 years of age and older and all UCSC staff and faculty. Membership provides access to UCSC Zipcars for rates starting at $8 per hour or $65 per day. For a limited time, UCSC affiliate members will receive $35 in driving credit as an incentive when they register for the program. The low hourly and daily rates include gas, maintenance, insurance and reserved parking. Community residents 21 years of age and older are also eligible to join and use Zipcar vehicles; different membership rates apply. All members 21 and older will also gain access to Zipcar's network of more than 3,500 vehicles throughout North America and the United Kingdom. Interested UCSC students, faculty, staff, and community members can apply to join Zipcar at <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/ucsc">www.zipcar.com/ucsc</a>.</p>
<p>For residential freshman and sophomore students, who are not allowed to purchase a parking permit on campus, and for any student who does not want to bring a privately owned car to school, Zipcar provides the freedom to travel off campus to shop locally, run errands or take a weekend trip. Zipcar also eliminates hundreds of dollars in monthly transportation costs, saving members an average of $436 per month or $5,232 per year when compared with car ownership--money that can be put toward other more relevant expenses such as tuition and housing.</p>
<p>Zipcar was selected as UCSC's car-sharing partner based on its ability to customize the car-sharing program to meet the needs of UCSC students and a proven track record of providing universities with a cost-effective and environmentally friendly transportation solution. UCSC now joins the dozens of colleges that have partnered with Zipcar to reduce traffic, noise and parking demands, including San Francisco State University, MIT, Columbia, Georgetown, Rutgers, American University, Harvard University, University of Minnesota, University of Toronto, University of North Carolina and University of Chicago.</p>
<p>The City of Santa Cruz is cooperating with UCSC by providing parking spaces in a city lot near the University Town Center at Cathcart and Cedar Streets so the program can be launched off campus as well. Expansion of the program to more locations and more vehicles will be determined based on demand.</p>

In every field of advanced study, UCSC attracts graduate students who are eager to acquire the knowledge and skills they need to find solutions to global challenges.</p><p>The disciplines of biological and environmental sciences illustrate perfectly the opportunities UCSC grad students have to do meaningful work that has real-world applications. In fact, in several recent high-profile cases, thesis research by UCSC graduate students in those fields has been the decisive factor in changing government policies and corporate actions. </p><p>	</p><p>"Most of the students I work with don't have a vision of themselves as academics--they want to save the world," says Donald Croll, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. "So we try to give students direct, hands-on opportunities in conservation biology."</p><p>	</p><p>One of Croll's students helped mount a successful legal challenge that blocked the construction of a liquefied natural gas terminal near a major seabird nesting colony. Two students in environmental toxicology, meanwhile, documented the sources of lead poisoning in albatrosses and California condors, prompting government actions to protect the birds. Here are their stories:</p><p><b>Threatened Islands</b></p><p>The Coronado Islands are located off the coast of Baja California, just south of the Mexican border. As part of her research for a master's degree in ocean sciences, graduate student Shaye Wolf documented the large and diverse populations of seabirds that nest on the Coronado Islands. These include the largest known colony of the rare Xantus's murrelet, a small seabird listed as endangered under Mexican law and threatened in California. </p><p>	</p><p>While she was doing her research, Wolf learned that Chevron was planning to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal less than 700 yards from the south island, which hosts the Xantus's murrelet colony. The murrelets and four other species that nest on the island are nocturnal, and Wolf was especially concerned about the effects of the terminal's lights.  </p><p>	</p><p>"These nocturnal seabirds are very sensitive to artificial light, and the tremendous amount of lighting from the terminals and tankers would have been devastating," Wolf says. "It doesn't make sense to put a big industrial facility the size of a football field right next to a biodiversity hot spot."</p><p>	</p><p>Through her husband Doug Bevington, a UCSC graduate student in sociology studying environmental advocacy groups, Wolf learned that a cross-border legal challenge could be filed through the Commission for Environmental Cooperation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Bevington, who earned his Ph.D. in June, contacted Jay Tutchton, director of the Environmental Law Clinical Partnership at the University of Denver, who agreed to help them file a petition with the NAFTA Commission.</p><p>	</p><p>Wolf wrote the science portion of the petition, Tutchton wrote the legal portion, and Bevington assembled a coalition of environmental groups to join them. Filed in 2005, the petition ultimately led to Chevron's announcement in March 2007 that it was abandoning its plans to build the LNG facility at the Coronado Islands site. Wolf earned a Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology this year and now works for the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity.</p><p><b>Condor Crisis</b></p><p>In 1982, the total population of California condors was just 22 birds. Four years later, as the wild population continued to plummet, biologists decided to capture the remaining wild condors and breed them in captivity. Now, 140 captive-bred California condors are flying free in California, Arizona, and Baja California. </p><p>But life in the wild is still full of hazards for this critically endangered species. Lead poisoning is one of the most serious and persistent threats to wild condors. At least 13 have died from lead poisoning, and dozens more have had to be captured and treated for it. </p><p>Conservationists have long believed that the problem results from the use of lead ammunition by hunters. Condors feed on carrion and can ingest fragments of lead bullets from animal carcasses and gut piles left behind by hunters. </p><p>Past efforts to ban lead ammunition in California have been stymied by opposition from hunting groups. But this year the situation is very different. As a direct result of a scientific study led by UCSC graduate student Molly Church, the California Department of Fish and Game recommended a ban on the use of lead bullets throughout the range of the California condor. Legislation to enact such a ban is now moving through the state legislature. </p><p>Church, who earned a master's degree in environmental toxicology in 2004 and is now at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Veterinary Medicine, was able to match the lead in blood samples from condors to the lead in ammunition obtained from a variety of sources throughout central California. She used a proven "fingerprinting" technique based on the unique isotope ratios found in different sources of lead.</p><p>Donald Smith, professor and chair of environmental toxicology, was Church's adviser and a coauthor of the scientific paper reporting her findings. He has testified at several hearings in Sacramento before State Senate and Assembly committees considering the bill to ban lead ammunition. </p><p>"Had it not been for the outstanding science in Molly's paper, the professional lobbyists for hunter-advocacy groups testifying in opposition to the bill would have gone unchallenged," Smith says.</p><p><b>Cleaning up Midway</b></p><p>Lead poisoning also affects albatrosses that nest on Midway Atoll, a former military base where lead-based paint from deteriorating buildings is an ongoing problem. Myra Finkelstein documented the problem as a UCSC graduate student in environmental toxicology and ocean sciences. </p><p>More than 400,000 nesting pairs of Laysan and black-footed albatrosses breed on Midway every year. Lead poisoning mainly affects Laysan albatross chicks in nests near the contaminated buildings. Finkelstein showed that the problem is a direct result of chicks eating paint chips in and around their nests. She estimates that as many as 10,000 chicks, or five percent of those hatched at Midway, die each year from lead poisoning. </p><p>Finkelstein's findings helped the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, to target its clean-up efforts. But a lack of adequate funding has meant that albatross chicks continue to suffer and die from lead poisoning. </p><p>"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been trying to clean it up, but their budget is limited," Finkelstein says. "The estimate for getting rid of all the lead-based paint was $5.6 million."</p><p>Finkelstein earned her Ph.D. in 2003 and is currently a David H. Smith Conservation Research Fellow in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. As part of her fellowship, she has been working with the American Bird Conservancy, a nonprofit conservation group, to publicize the plight of the albatrosses on Midway. </p><p>In 2006, the group saw an opportunity to draw attention to the situation when Midway Atoll became part of the newly created Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument. As a result of their efforts, First Lady Laura Bush visited Midway in March 2007 to highlight the creation of the monument and the conservation issues it faces, and she expressed her support for efforts to fund the clean-up of lead paint.</p><p>"We're very hopeful that the money will be made available," Finkelstein says. "It's a beautiful island, and there does seem to be a growing recognition that this problem needs to be dealt with in a timely manner."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91533b368072704601a012ff87aa3036"><name>1605</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Gifford-Gonzalez travels to Argentina as Fulbright Senior Specialist</title><summary>Anthropology professor Diane Gifford-Gonzalez recently completed a four-week visit to Argentina as a Fulbright Senior Specialist.&#13;

<p><strong>Statement from George Blumenthal, UC Santa Cruz Chancellor, about LRDP court decision and mediation:</strong></p>
<p>"We will actively and creatively participate in mediation. My personal support for a negotiated settlement to this costly litigation is why I and other campus representatives have attempted on multiple occasions to reach fair-share agreements with the City and County concerning traffic, housing, and water. Those discussions didn't produce agreements, but I am very hopeful that a mediated negotiation might accomplish what those discussions did not.</p>
<p>"We are grateful that the Court recognized the university's right to grow in order to serve the students of California. Still, we respectfully disagree with the Court's ruling under the California Environmental Quality Act. The campus, therefore, reserves the right to appeal after the Court files its judgment.</p>
<p>"It is my sincere hope, however, that a mediated agreement will render unnecessary such an appeal and the continuation of this litigation."</p>
<p><strong>Background on selection of mediator:</strong></p>
<p>.Â University representatives have reviewed the names of the four mediators the Judge suggested several weeks ago. We and the Stevens petitioners have mutually agreed on a potential mediator who was recommended by Judge Burdick, and we anxiously await the City's response to that proposal.</p>

<p><strong>Statement from George Blumenthal, UC Santa Cruz Chancellor, about delay of Biomedical Sciences Facility:</strong></p>
<p>"Delaying the construction of this building is a lose-lose proposition: It's a setback for the campus, in the fields that would be served by this building; and it's a setback for the local community, as these labs would serve as an incubator for the spin-off companies that will spur the local economy."</p>
<p><strong>Background on Biomedical Sciences Facility:</strong></p>
<p>. Approximately 92,300 sf of wet laboratory space and core specialized facilities to support interdisciplinary research for the Departments of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Environmental Toxicology, Biomolecular Engineering concentrating in health and medical issues. The project site is an existing paved parking lot, located in the Science Hill area of the central campus.</p>
<p>. UCSC had been aiming for a November construction start.</p>
<p>. The building cost had originally been estimated at $80 million.</p>

<br/>
<p>UC Santa Cruz takes your breath away. This place, this magical estate, this serene redwood forest perched like a guardian angel watching over the blue crescent of the Monterey Bay is so beautiful, it makes you want to just close your eyes and breathe. It heightens your senses. It teases your curiosity. It promises hidden treasures. And delivers them.</p>
<p>This is a place born of innovation. A place so physically extraordinary that it caused its founding fathers to stop and ask questions. How do we create a place that changes the game, exceeds all expectations, inspires generation after generation of students and faculty? How do we develop a world-class educational institution that is every bit as stunning and surprising as the venerable land on which it is built? How do we draw students who are much more eager to learn than to be done with learning, students who crave to magnify their connection with beauty, who secretly long to change the world? How do we draw teachers who see beyond their disciplines, who hunger for an opposing point of view, for a different and unexpected thread of connection to another world, another idea, another explanation, another invention?</p>
<p>In fact, before it was born, as Clark Kerr and Dean McHenry and other founders speculated on what they would build in this beautiful place, they imagined UC Santa Cruz as a major research university, built around intimate residential colleges, dedicated to providing an extraordinary undergraduate experience, nurtured by close faculty-student interaction and human-scale community life. Their dream is our reality.</p>
<p>For UC Santa Cruz is a major research university, breaking through to new concepts in engineering, in history, in astrophysics, in digital media, in linguistics, in music, in social policy, the environment, literature, theater, anthropology, economics and biology and art. Yet we have an uncommon dedication to undergraduates: this is a place where undergrads work on major research projects side-by-side with faculty and graduate students. Because we believe that moving undergrads to the front lines of exploration develops both their sense of adventure and of responsibility. It helps them understand that life thrums with possibility, but that uncovering and tapping that possibility takes structure, discipline, knowledge and intensity.</p>
<p>This is a large place and a small place. At 15,000 students or so, UCSC is nearly 50% larger than MIT, and slightly larger than Stanford. But while Stanford has 45 undergrads to every 55 graduate students, UCSC's ratio is 91 to 9. This not only provides greater access for undergrads, but, ironically, much more attention for graduate students as well.</p>
<p>UC Berkeley has some 40,000 students squeezed into 635 acres of land, compressed into the middle of a city, while UC Santa Cruz's 15,000 students enjoy a campus set within more than 2,000 acres of forest and meadow, five minutes downhill to a seaside resort, ten minutes from an ocean teeming with life.</p>
<p>The founders were looking to capture the best of both worlds. In order to develop a university of major proportion, but maintain the intimacy of a small college, they modeled UC Santa Cruz after Cambridge, Oxford and Swarthmore universities. Each student belongs to and begins by living in a college within the university; each of the ten colleges has its own theme: politics, humanities, art, diversity, science, emerging cultures, the environment, et al; each college has its own architecture, its own feel. Cowell College, with its white stucco walls overlooks the bay like an Italian villa. Merrill College is nestled in the woods, blue roofs stretching to and merging with the sky. Kresge College is nearly invisible upon approach, with forest brown outer walls, but inside comes to life, a bustling village bursting with primary colors.</p>
<p>In each college, students take a core course that brings them together, regardless of their major, a course that opens doors for them they might not open themselves, that involves them with other students with whom they live, and faculty who are members not only of their departments but of the college as well. But at UCSC, faculty and students populate a much larger world; they range far from their individual colleges, far from their individual disciplines, teaching and taking classes all over this surprisingly large campus.</p>
<p>In fact, UC Santa Cruz is in many ways a microcosm of, a distillation of, a concentration of a much larger constellation: California. What issues does California face, and how does California lead the world? Unlike other universities that silo their academic tracks in narrow departmental studies, our Academic Plan takes into account the biggest issues facing this complex state of ours, and wraps them together with six themes that guide our growth and educational offerings, six themes that cross the boundaries of individual disciplines, six themes that cross-pollinate intellectual pursuit, research and vitality:</p>
<p><strong>Cross Cultural Initiatives:</strong> California is the most multi-cultural state in the US, perhaps the world. At UCSC we are exploring who we are, our cultural, gender and ethnic identities, bringing together the best minds in Social Sciences and Humanities to discover and map the human sense of self.</p>
<p><strong>Evolving Environments, Science and Policy:</strong> California leads the world in environmental stewardship. At UCSC we are spearheading investigations of environmental change and its public policy implications, merging the fascinations and probing analyses of scientists and sociologists as we explore the earth's climate and ecosystems and its ability to sustain life.</p>
<p><strong>Human Health Studies:</strong> California leads the world in biotechnology and has taken the lead in U.S. stem cell research. With extensive collaboration from Physical and Biological Sciences, Engineering, Humanities, and Social Sciences, we are forging innovative new academic and research programs in the health sciences, encompassing genetics, toxicology, stem cells, bioengineering, assistive devices, and cultural understanding and communication of health issues.</p>
<p><strong>Public Documentation and Communication:</strong> California's most famous industries are film and technology. At UCSC the best minds in the Divisions of Arts, Engineering, Humanities and Social Sciences explore the role of public media, sound, visual and digital media, and the arts in transmitting knowledge, emotion, identity and power.</p>
<p><strong>Technological Developments and Their Societal Impacts:</strong> Silicon Valley not only leads the world with advances in computer sciences but in bioengineering and space technologies as well. With cooperation between Engineering, Physical and Biological Sciences, Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, we're pushing technological advancement ever forward, while exploring the ramifications for society, environment, ethics, social justice and nationhood.</p>
<p><strong>Transnationalism and Globalization:</strong> California has the sixth largest economy in the world, and leads U.S. interaction with the burgeoning economies of Asia. UC Santa Cruz addresses issues involving global trade, including business management, culture, human rights, labor regulations, monetary policy, international communications and much more, focusing experts from many disciplines on the future of our relations with the world.</p>
<p>At the core of everything we do is a sense of surprise and discovery. Walk through the campus, and you walk through groves of redwood trees. Cross a footbridge traversing a deep swale, a furrowed wrinkle in the mountain, and once across, you round a bend and suddenly, there's a building. It appears out of nowhere like a buck in the woods, hidden until you're right upon it, completely at home in its natural setting.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, we ache for surprise, for discovery. Our faculty members are making breakthroughs relentlessly. Our students are opening new doors at a pace they've never before experienced. Our graduates are changing the world. Our programs are redefining education and reshaping the future.</p>
<p>Our greatest hope is to instill that sense of surprise in our students. A few stories:</p>
<p>One student came to us, as she describes herself, a "17-year-old dumb, little girl arts major from Southern California." Required to take a science course, she reluctantly enrolled in a class in oceanography. She became entranced with tidal biology. Somehow ended up taking calculus and physics. And became the Kathy Sullivan we know today, the first woman to walk in space.</p>
<p>Another student grew up in Mexico, in a cardboard shack with dirt floors. Reyna Grande was the first of her family ever to go to college. She had to overcome her status as an undocumented immigrant in the United States, overcome the cultural divide, overcome the language barrier. She did so with a flourish, graduating with a degree in creative writing/ film and video. And wrote a stunning novel, <em>Across a Hundred Mountains,</em> required reading in two UCSC core courses today.</p>
<p>Kent Nagano conducts the Los Angeles Opera.</p>
<p>Maya Rudolph tickles our funny bones in the cast of Saturday Night Live.</p>
<p>Lawrence Weschler has authored 11 books, and directs the NY Institute for the Humanities.</p>
<p>Jonathan Gershenzon directs the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena Germany.</p>
<p>Katy Roberts is the chief editor of the <em>New York Times</em> "Week in Review" section.</p>
<p>Cheryl Scott ran the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention operations in Tanzania and is now a medical director at CDC headquarters.</p>
<p>Margaret Fox is a restaurateur, Steven Hawley is an astronaut, Bruce Stein is shaping land use policy in the Mojave Desert and Mostafa Ghous is helping re-engineer his war-torn homeland of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>All are graduates of UC Santa Cruz. And represent a very small sample of our success stories. What unites all these people, what is the common thread that runs through their lives and their work?</p>
<p>In reading their stories, in seeing their accomplishments one gets an overwhelming sense that these are people with tremendous passion, people who can see into themselves, and then beyond themselves, who move forward with confidence and commitment, and most of all, with care. They really do care. About their own lives. About society. About their art, their science, about the world.</p>
<p>How does care develop? There is no single way. But we find that same sense of care that we see in our students is overflowing in our faculty. In their dedication to teaching. In their dedication to breaking down barriers between what is and what can be. In their dedication to research, invention and innovation. In their broad and eclectic interest that has them reaching across disciplines for solutions to complex problems.</p>
<p>When you think of linguistics, you think of the study of languages, the etymology of words. But here at UC Santa Cruz, the Linguistics Department, ranked somewhere between #2 and #9 in the US (depending on whom you ask), has contributed to a groundbreaking computer project at the NASA Ames Research Center. Visiting Professor Beth Ann Hockey is the project leader for Clarissa, a spoken-dialogue system (think HAL from <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>), that directs astronauts through procedures, remembers their individual voices, answers questions and responds to spoken commands. Because it turns out using a laptop in zero gravity is, well, awkward at the very least.</p>
<p>History Professor Alice Yang Murray is exploring with her students how people in the U.S. and Japan had very different World War II experiences and very different memories of the causes and consequences of the war. But this is no mere history project. It's a joint effort between History and Digital Arts, to create a web site replete with virtual tours of the many Pacific War memorial sites.</p>
<p>UCSC now offers a new bioengineering major. Professor Manduchi is heading up a research team to engineer equipment to help blind people negotiate their environment. They've invented a laser cane that can sense obstacles in a person's path. A computer mouse that translates onscreen features into tactile sensations. They're combining a camera and computer in a cell phone to help blind people find bathrooms and elevators in unfamiliar locations. It takes engineering, and an understanding of society, and disability, and environment.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz's physics department is rated #1 in the nation for citation impact. Alan Litke, an adjunct professor of physics at UCSC, has been conducting research at the intersection of physics and biology developing new technology for studying neural networks in brain tissue. While Alexander Sher, a post-doctoral researcher, is studying neural networks in the retina. They're developing technologies that may some day be used to enable blind people to see.</p>
<p>UCSC offers the first major in the UC system in computer game design. Think about it. Technology. Storytelling. Art. Business. Big business.</p>
<p>Our anthropologists have joined with our Earth and Planetary Sciences professors to study the diet of early human ancestors.</p>
<p>Our literature department has joined our history department to study recently discovered texts of ancient India.</p>
<p>Our nano engineers have found a way to harness light on a computer chip to create highly sensitive chemical and biological sensors. They then teamed with our chemists and our molecular biologists to develop new portable devices for medical diagnostics and environmental testing.</p>
<p>Our astronomy department, always ranked among the very best in the nation, is uncovering clues to the evolution of globular clusters, having discovered a star cluster more than a billion light-years away.</p>
<p>Our literature faculty created the Dickens Project, now recognized internationally as the premier center for Dickens studies in the world.</p>
<p>Our theater arts faculty and campus administrators had the foresight to establish Shakespeare Santa Cruz as a professional theater company with residence on campus, and its annual festival is now one of the most celebrated events of its kind in the nation.</p>
<p>To get to Theater Arts, walk down Science Hill, and enter the woods once again. Cross another footbridge and chasm, and wend your way west until suddenly you arrive at Performing Arts, home of a theater in the round. The Performing Arts Center is about to be augmented with a major new Arts Complex, offering more performing venues and a museum, an arts center to draw the town community, one that will stretch across the road, and through the fields to connect with the Music Center overlooking the sparkling bay.</p>
<p>As you stand and watch the water, realize just where you are. Smack dab in the dead center of the California Coast. In the middle of farm country, Brussels sprouts, artichokes, lettuce. You're 25 short minutes from the third largest city in California, San Jose. You're in the closest UC campus to the technological center of the world, Silicon Valley. You're staring at the Bay and beyond, at the ocean that leads to the Far East.</p>
<p>You're standing at a flashpoint of invention: musical, artistic, filmic, biological, chemical, nano, historical, linguistic, software.</p>
<p>You're standing at the crossroads of policy development: societal, technological, ethical, scientific, environmental.</p>
<p>You're standing where exploration of the deep and stellar past meets the creation of a better future.</p>
<p>You're standing in a community more diverse, with more backgrounds and ethnicities and beliefs, passions and interests than your grandparents ever thought possible.</p>
<p>You're standing among rebels and visionaries. Among people who think. People who care. Care enough to act. To give themselves to the world. And change it.</p>
<p>You're standing at UC Santa Cruz. A place utterly unlike any other.</p>
