Of the master's degrees awarded by UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering in 2004-05, 44.2 percent went to women. </p><p>The survey was reported in the January 2007 issue of ASEE Prism, a magazine published by the American Society for Engineering Education. UCSC was the only UC campus in the top 20 for this category. </p><p>"I am delighted by this statistic--it is an impressive number. We have always tried to make our graduate programs welcoming to everybody and to create a supportive environment for all students," said Darrell Long, associate dean for research and graduate studies in the Baskin School of Engineering. </p><p>The National Science Board and other national groups have raised concerns in recent years about the low representation of women in engineering and related fields. Studies show that fewer women than men choose to pursue degrees in engineering and that women are more likely to drop out of the educational "pipeline" before earning advanced degrees. </p><p>"We try to admit the best people, and if there are qualified women we will recruit them aggressively. But attracting women to the engineering disciplines in general has been an issue nationwide," Long said.  </p><p>The presence of a significant number of women on UCSC's engineering faculty and good support groups for women within the engineering school probably help UCSC to retain female students who might otherwise get discouraged and drop out, said Martine Schlag, a professor of computer engineering and faculty adviser to a graduate student organization called eWomen. </p><p>"In many engineering schools, women do feel very isolated. So the support provided by a group like eWomen probably does have an impact on graduation rates," Schlag said.</p><p>Laura Chiticariu, copresident of eWomen, said the group organizes a variety of activities, including talks and panel discussions on issues relevant to women in engineering. This quarter, for example, a panel of women faculty in the engineering school will discuss interviewing for jobs after graduate school. </p><p>"We try to invite women role models to talk about issues of interest to us," Chiticariu said. "We also have bimonthly lunch meetings and other get-togethers. It's a supportive peer environment."</p><p>Richard Hughey, professor and chair of computer engineering, has actively encouraged the establishment of support groups for women in the engineering school. Hughey is a faculty adviser to eWomen and to the UCSC student chapter of the Society for Women Engineers (SWE). One of the founders of eWomen, graduate student Angela Schmid, had been president of the UCSC SWE chapter as an undergraduate (see <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/03-04/06-14/schmid.html">profile</a>).</p><p>"We have been working to build a good community for graduate student women within the engineering school and on the campus in general," Hughey said. </p><p>Some of the fields in which the Baskin School of Engineering is especially strong--such as bioinformatics and biomolecular engineering--tend to attract more women than other areas of engineering, Hughey noted. UCSC also has more female faculty members in engineering than most engineering schools that grant Ph.D.s. And the campus's proximity to Silicon Valley is a factor that helps to attract engineering graduate students in general.</p><p>"Whatever the reasons may be, these results show that UCSC is a great place for women to be graduate students," Hughey said.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9150c0a88072704601a012ff001b67c3"><name>1045</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Chance discovery sheds light on the fates of young salmon</title><summary>Fisheries scientists are gaining unexpected insights from the serendipitous discovery on Año Nuevo Island of tiny tags that had been implanted in juvenile salmon and steelhead in coastal creeks.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>salmon, Ano Nuevo, fisheries</keywords><description>Fisheries scientists are gaining unexpected insights from the serendipitous discovery on Año Nuevo Island of tiny tags that had been implanted in juvenile salmon and steelhead in coastal creeks.</description><start-date>1170399600000</start-date><display-name>Chance discovery sheds light...</display-name><path>/2007/02/1045</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/02/1045</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338242684</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338242684</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Fisheries scientists are gaining unexpected insights from the serendipitous discovery on Año Nuevo Island of tiny tags that had been implanted in juvenile salmon and steelhead in coastal creeks.</p><p>The first tags were found by Patricia Morris, a research biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and assistant manager of UCSC's Año Nuevo Island Reserve. The island, located a half-mile out to sea, hosts abundant populations of seals, sea lions, and seabirds. Researchers now suspect the tags came from fish that were eaten by birds. </p><p>When Morris was crawling through the muck of Año Nuevo Island in May of 2006 on gloved hands and padded knees, she wasn't trying to make a scientific discovery. She was mainly trying to get to her research terrace without disturbing the sea lions. Two unusual objects caught her eye as she crawled along--first, a flat, black plastic hexagon about half an inch across, and a week later, a glass object the size and shape of an uncooked grain of rice. </p><p>"You're kind of just sitting there, looking idly at the ground. In nature, things don't have perfect shapes--that's out of place, and it catches your eye," Morris said. </p><p>The glass grain of rice turned out to be a type of microchip called a passive integrated transponder (PIT), like the identification chips pet owners put in their dogs and cats. A PIT tag can be scanned, like a bag of frozen peas at the grocery store, to reveal identifying information about the animal.</p><p>Morris was able to scan the PIT tag and eventually figured out that it belonged to Sean Hayes and Morgan Bond, researchers in the Salmon Ecology Team at the NOAA Fisheries Lab near UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory. The black hexagonal tag was theirs, too--it was an implantable temperature logger designed to monitor the body temperature of tagged fish. (All three researchers are UCSC biology alumni--Morris with B.A. and M.A. degrees, Hayes with M.S. and Ph.D. degrees, and Bond with B.S. and M.A. degrees.)</p><p>The Salmon Ecology Team tags juvenile salmon and steelhead trout every year in Scotts Creek before they migrate out into the open ocean. The researchers hope to catch at least a small percentage of the fish over the next few years when they return to the creeks to spawn. Researchers scan captured fish for PIT tags and record each fish's tag number, size, and weight. If the fish is carrying a logger, the PIT tag lets the researchers know so they can take the fish to the lab and quickly remove the logger. </p><p>The logger takes a temperature reading every four hours. Because the fish is cold-blooded, its body temperature mirrors that of the water through which it swims. The scientists use data from the temperature loggers to try to figure out where the fish go and how they spend their time after they leave Scotts Creek.</p><p>After Morris got in touch with the Salmon Ecology Team, they came out and scanned the island for more PIT tags, most recently on January 24. So far they have recovered 60 PIT tags and 2 temperature loggers. Most of the PIT tags are from fish that were released in 2005 in Scotts Creek, but some came from as far away as Soquel Creek and as far back as 2003. </p><p>"This seems to be happening year after year," Bond said. "There are probably more older tags there, they're just buried." </p><p>But the first logger Morris found on Año Nuevo Island told a fascinating story. Hayes and Bond implanted the logger in a hatchery-raised Coho salmon on March 15, 2006. That salmon swam down Scotts Creek to the lagoon, where it lasted 13 days. On March 28, the temperature logger records it was eaten by a warm-blooded predator. The logger emerged on top of Año Nuevo Island on March 29. </p><p>Because it showed up on top of the island, researchers can rule out the theory that an elephant seal or a harbor seal ate the Coho. Hayes and Bond say the guilty predator is probably a bird, but they can't be sure.</p><p>"Unfortunately, the temperature loggers top out at about 25 degrees Celsius," Bond said. "The stomach temperature of the predator was much warmer than that. We never thought that we'd recover the tag of any of our fish that got eaten. We missed getting a good, precise measurement of the predator's body temperature."</p><p>To Hayes and Bond, the interesting thing about the temperature logger data is that it indicates that the Coho got eaten before it even made it out of the relative safety of the creek to the open ocean. </p><p>"The suspicion is that the predator is gulls," Hayes said. "It was a surprise only because we hadn't thought about it. In hindsight it makes sense." </p><p>Gulls spend a lot of time hanging out on the beach, where Scotts Creek broadens into a shallow stream only six inches deep, according to the researchers.</p><p>"If a big flock of gulls happens to be there at the same time that a big group of fish comes flooding out onto the beach, they're kind of running the gauntlet there," Bond said.</p><p>Also, the area on the island where Morris found the temperature logger is almost exclusively populated by nesting gulls. Hayes and Bond hope that further scans of the island will provide deeper insights into who's eating the fish. Bond is building a new scanner that will be more flexible and can scan farther than the improvised setup he initially used to scan the island.</p><p>"We've only scanned about half of the island. With the new scanner, I'll be able to scan under rocks and inside burrows," Bond said.</p><p>Hayes also hopes to raise funding for a study to determine if gulls are, in fact, eating the salmon and steelhead. He said that some researchers are skeptical that gulls are eating the fish, some of which were a foot long when they were consumed. Prior to this discovery, most researchers thought gulls ate only a very small percentage of young fish, while these results indicate that they may be a major predator. </p><p>"Seagulls have to eat something," Hayes said. "They haven't always lived off our dumps and McDonald's deposits."</p><p>Hayes and Bond will likely collect another year or two of data before they publish their results. They're grateful for this stroke of luck that allowed them to take a peek into the lives of young fish.</p><p>"Most of the time as a fish biologist, you tag a bunch of fish, they go out to sea, and most of them never come back," said Bond. "It was just pure luck that Pat Morris happened to see those tags on the island."</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Patricia Morris at (831) 429-5342 or pamorris@ucsc.edu; Sean Hayes at (831) 420-3937 or sean.hayes@noaa.org; and Morgan Bond at (831) 420-3955 or morgan.bond@noaa.org.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9150c20e8072704601a012ff683c7962"><name>1046</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz film grads shine again in major indie film awards</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1170486000000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz film...</display-name><path>/2007/02/1046</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/02/1046</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338243012</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338243012</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz alumnus Aaron Platt has been nominated for a 2007 Independent Spirit Award in the category of "Best Cinematography" for his work on the feature film, Wild Tigers I Have Known--written and directed by fellow alum, Cam Archer. Executive-produced by Gus Van Sant, the film was an official selection at last year's Sundance Film Festival.</p><p>The Independent Spirit Awards are considered to be the "Oscars" of the independent film world. Platt will be competing against such cinematographers as Guillermo Navarro who shot the acclaimed film Pan's Labyrinth. The awards ceremony will be broadcast live from Santa Monica on February 24 on IFC (Independent Film Channel) with an edited re-broadcast airing later that evening on AMC (American Movie Channel).</p><p>Last year's Independent Spirit Award winners included Brokeback Mountain, which won Best Feature and Best Director (Ang Lee); Capote for Best Screenplay and Best Male Lead (Philip Seymour Hoffman); and Crash for Best First Feature and Best Supporting Male (Matt Dillon)-as well as UC Santa Cruz alumnus Ian Olds (a 1998 graduate in film/video and anthropology) who received the Independent Spirit Award in the "Truer than Fiction" category for Occupation: Dreamland, his documentary feature about the Iraq War. (See UC Santa Cruz Review magazine story at http://review.ucsc.edu/fall06/RevF06-pp20-21_Embedded.pdf).</p><p>  </p><p>Platt graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2003 with a bachelor's degree in film and digital media.  He said he was truly honored to be nominated and acknowledged out of so many people in the film industry.  </p><p>"Making Wild Tigers felt like everyone involved was participating in something that would go beyond anything we had ever made before," Platt noted. "I think the hard work, spirit, and creativity is what gets recognized in the film ultimately...we were trying to create something amazing, and weren't worried about the degree of success the movie would have in the end."</p><p>"Our (Cam and my) low-fi style has always felt like true independent work in the making, and to be put side-by-side with movies made for over $15 million just goes to show that anyone can make a lot with very little," he added. </p><p>Eligible films for the Independent Spirit Awards must be at least 70 minutes long, and the cost of the completed film--including post-production--must be under $20 million. Films also need to have been shown in a commercial theater for at least one week between January 1 and December 31, 2006, or shown at one of the following festivals in 2006: Film Independent's Los Angeles Film Festival; New Directors/New Films, New York; Sundance, Telluride, or Toronto.</p><p>UCSC assistant professor of film and digital media Irene Gustafson was not surprised to hear about the nomination. Two short films that Platt and Archer had previously made as projects in her film production class were chosen in 2004 to be part of the prestigious Sundance Film Festival (see UCSC Review cover story at http://review.ucsc.edu/fall04/index.html). </p><p> </p><p>"Aaron is an excellent cinematographer and his work on Cam Archer's Wild Tigers I Have Known was stunning," she said. "He deserves this nomination and I hope he wins."</p><p>"Aaron and Cam began collaborating as undergraduates in the UC Santa Cruz Film and Digital Media Department, and that creative relationship has really been one of the key elements in their success," she added. </p><p>_______						</p><p>Note to reporters: </p><p>Aaron Platt can be contacted at:  plattino@mac.com</p><p>UC Santa Cruz Professor Irene Gustafson, can be reached at:  ireneg@ucsc.edu</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9150c3998072704601a012ff1fc9b611"><name>1047</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC ranked first in nation for research impact in physics</title><summary>In a new analysis of research publications from top U.S. universities, the University of California, Santa Cruz, ranked first for the impact of its faculty in the field of physics and fifth in the field of space sciences. </summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>physics, rankings, astronomy</keywords><description>In a new analysis of research publications from top U.S. universities, the University of California, Santa Cruz, ranked first for the impact of its faculty in the field of physics and fifth in the field of space sciences. </description><start-date>1170745200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC ranked first in...</display-name><path>/2007/02/1047</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/02/1047</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338243435</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338243435</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In a new analysis of research publications from top U.S. universities, the University of California, Santa Cruz, ranked first for the impact of its faculty in the field of physics and fifth in the field of space sciences. The new rankings were reported in <i>Science Watch,</i> a newsletter published by Thompson Scientific. </p><p>Thompson Scientific gathers data from thousands of influential, peer-reviewed journals and conducts analyses to identify trends and measure research performance. A commonly used performance measure, called citation impact, is based on the number of times a published paper is cited by other researchers. The latest rankings are based on the citation impact of research papers published by the top 100 federally funded universities between 2001 and 2005. </p><p>UCSC has been highly ranked in similar surveys in the past. Past rankings for the campus, all based on citation impact data, include first among U.S. universities in space sciences (2003), second worldwide in physical sciences (2001), and first among U.S. universities in physics (2000).</p><p>"We are a small department, but our faculty have good collaborations with researchers in other departments and at other institutions," said David Belanger, professor and chair of physics. "Our faculty also tend to work on very fundamental problems in physics, and important results in those areas are cited a lot by other researchers."</p><p>When researchers publish an article in a scientific journal, they must cite previous papers by other authors that set the stage for their work. Generally, a paper that describes important findings or ideas and influences the work of other researchers receives more citations than less influential papers.</p><p>Major areas of research in UCSC's Physics Department include high-energy particle physics, condensed matter theory, and astrophysics and cosmology. The Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) has been at the forefront of both theoretical and experimental research in particle physics for many years. Research on condensed matter physics at UCSC involves a broad range of topics, including the behavior of novel materials, the physics of superconductors, and new approaches to making photovoltaic cells for harvesting solar energy. </p><p>UCSC physicists are also making important contributions in the areas of high-energy astrophysics and cosmology--working on experiments to detect gamma rays and other elusive signals from space, investigating the nature of dark matter, and exploring the evolution of structure in the universe. Research in these areas bridges the categories of physics and space sciences. </p><p>"There are a lot of connections between physics and astronomy at UCSC. It's not a coincidence that the campus is highly ranked in both categories," Belanger said.</p><p>UCSC has long been recognized as a center of excellence for research in astronomy and related fields. The Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics includes leading researchers on both the observational and theoretical aspects of space sciences. The UC Observatories/Lick Observatory and the national Center for Adaptive Optics are both headquartered on the UCSC campus. And the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences has a growing number of faculty involved in research on planets and other objects in our solar system and around other stars. </p><p>Belanger noted that the Physics Department's graduate program received the highest rating for overall student satisfaction in a 2001 survey of U.S. graduate students. The department also works to engage undergraduates in research and has one of the fastest-growing undergraduate programs in the country, he said. </p><p>"We pay a lot of attention to our students, cultivate a good atmosphere in the department, and then they become very productive. We have 19 faculty members and 65 graduate students, and one-third of them are women--twice the national average.

With support from the National Institutes of Health and the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, they are developing new tools to investigate the activity of living neural networks and building interdisciplinary partnerships with neuroscientists.</p><p>Alan Litke, an adjunct professor of physics at UCSC, has been conducting research at the intersection of physics and biology for over a decade. In 2006, he received a $395,000 NIH grant to develop new technology for studying neural networks in brain tissue. Alexander Sher, a postdoctoral researcher in Litke's lab, has just received a $500,000 career award from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund to support his research on neural networks in the retina. Both projects use arrays of microscopic electrodes to probe the activity of large numbers of neurons simultaneously. </p><p>Sher's award from Burroughs Wellcome Fund's Scientific Interface program is intended to encourage and reward interdisciplinary research by helping researchers with backgrounds in the physical and computational sciences apply their skills to research in biology. That's exactly what Sher, who spent 15 years studying high-energy physics, is doing.</p><p>"All the training I've had up until now, through all my undergraduate and graduate career, was really in physics, and now I'm switching to neurobiology," Sher said. "It's a difficult transition. This grant makes it much, much easier."</p><p>Litke still conducts research in both worlds. He studies high-energy particle physics at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, and is affiliated with the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) at UCSC. Meanwhile, he is collaborating on neurobiological research with neuroscientists at UCSC and other institutions. </p><p>"The award from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund is designed to support interdisciplinary work, and it really validates what we're doing in Santa Cruz," Litke said.</p><p>Until recently, his experiments took place in the laboratories of collaborators at other institutions, using microelectrode arrays and other instruments that Litke's group at SCIPP developed. Now, however, Litke has begun conducting some experiments in the UCSC laboratory of David Feldheim, an assistant professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology who studies retinal and neural development in mice. In addition, the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences has provided laboratory space and seed money for Litke and Feldheim to establish an interdisciplinary neurophysiology lab on campus.</p><p>"Once we get the facility up and running, it will attract neuroscientists from all around the Bay Area to come here to use this technology  that's how special it is," Feldheim said.</p><p>Most of Litke's previous work on neural networks has focused on the retina, a thin layer of tissue on the back wall of the eye. The retina converts light into electrical signals, processes those signals, and sends the output to the brain via the optic nerve. Sher is currently using the microelectrode array to record signals from retinal neurons in an effort to understand color vision. </p><p>"I record the output of the retina while showing different color stimuli to the receptors. That lets me start to understand what's going on," Sher said.</p><p>Sher places a slice of living retinal tissue on top of an array of microelectrodes in a special chamber that can keep the tissue alive for several hours. He focuses flickering images on the photoreceptors while the microelectrode array monitors the retinal neurons' responses.</p><p>With his new NIH grant, Litke uses a similar system to study neural networks in brain tissue from rats and mice. He has increased the size of the microelectrode array from 60 to 512 electrodes. He is also modifying the instrument so that it will not only record signals from the neurons, but will also stimulate them with electrical signals, just as images were used to stimulate the retinal cells.</p><p>These studies could help reveal how neurons process, store, and recall information. According to Litke, neuroscientists have traditionally studied one neuron or a very small group of neurons. But understanding how the brain works will require studying how systems of neurons work together. </p><p>"Thinking is presumably not based on what a single neuron is doing, but on the firing patterns of many, many neurons," Litke explained. </p><p>Networks of neurons in the brain are able to recognize patterns, store information, and recall it when it's needed. Litke said he is excited about the possibility of studying these phenomena in a controlled way using the new microelectrode array.</p><p>"We will be able to send in a pattern of information through the electrodes and then record the response of this living neural network to see how it responds," Litke said. "Can we store the pattern inside this piece of living, neural tissue? If we keep sending the same pattern, maybe it will begin to play that pattern spontaneously."</p><p>Simply being able to record neural activity in a slice of brain tissue or a layer of brain cells grown in a Petri dish is in itself a remarkable thing, Litke said.</p><p>"It's fascinating that all this is happening in a little squirmy piece of stuff only a few hundred microns thick," Litke said.</p><p>Litke's collaborators on the NIH grant, in addition to Sher, include John Beggs at the Biocomplexity Institute at Indiana University; Wladyslaw Dabrowski at AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow, Poland; and SCIPP researchers Alex Grillo, Pawel Hottowy, and Serguei Kachiguine. The retinal experiments are performed in close collaboration with E. J. Chichilnisky at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.</p><p>The Burroughs Wellcome Fund is an independent private foundation dedicated to advancing the biomedical sciences. </p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Alexander Sher at (831) 459-5701 or sasha@ucsc.edu or Alan Litke at alan.litke@cern.ch.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9150c6b18072704601a012ff1e8c9ba8"><name>1049</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Dean of UCSC's Arts Division</title><start-date>1170831600000</start-date><display-name>Dean of UCSC's Arts...</display-name><path>/2007/02/1049</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/02/1049</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338244171</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338244171</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We write to inform you of a leadership transition in the Arts Division.

The new major, leading to a B.S. degree, prepares students for careers at the interfaces between engineering, medicine, and biology.</p><p>The bioengineering program involves faculty in four departments--three in the Baskin School of Engineering (biomolecular engineering, computer engineering, and electrical engineering) and one in the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences (molecular, cell, and developmental biology). The program, which will be administered by the engineering school, will begin admitting students to the new major in spring 2007. </p><p>"This program is a collaboration between science and engineering faculty that will serve students with a wide range of interests," said Richard Hughey, professor and chair of computer engineering.</p><p>UCSC faculty are engaged in a broad range of bioengineering research projects, providing opportunities for undergraduates to learn from and take part in faculty research. Research areas include biomolecular sensors, nanoelectronic implants, assistive technologies for the elderly and disabled, bioinformatics, molecular design, and environmental monitoring. </p><p>The new bioengineering program is distinguished by UCSC's strengths in areas such as bioinformatics, molecular biology, and bioelectronics, and it also has an important bioethics component, said Phillip Berman, professor and chair of biomolecular engineering. </p><p>"We are developing a program for the genome era, building on the latest developments in biotechnology to meet the needs of the future," Berman said. </p><p>Graduates of the program will be prepared to work as engineers solving problems in the biomedical and biomolecular domains and to pursue advanced degrees in engineering, medicine, or science. Bioengineering provides students with fundamental knowledge of mathematics, science, and technology, and advanced training in engineering principles and practice at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. </p><p>The bioengineering major is challenging because of the large number of courses required to provide a multidisciplinary foundation in engineering, mathematics, and science, Hughey said. To make sure beginning students can quickly engage in the discipline, the  program includes several entry-level courses without prerequisites. These include courses in bioethics, clinical health care, and universal access and assistive technologies (see <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1051">related press release</a>).</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9150ca018072704601a012ff43815489"><name>1051</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New course teaches UCSC students about disability</title><summary>UCSC is offering a new general education course on universal access and assistive technology, enabling students from all majors to learn more about disability and the issues that surround it.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Roberto Manduchi, universal access</keywords><description>UCSC is offering a new general education course on universal access and assistive technology, enabling students from all majors to learn more about disability and the issues that surround it.</description><start-date>1171263600000</start-date><display-name>New course teaches UCSC...</display-name><path>/2007/02/1051</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/02/1051</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338245066</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338245066</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California, Santa Cruz, is offering a new general education course on universal access and assistive technology, enabling students from all majors to learn more about disability and the issues that surround it.</p><p>The course is taught by Roberto Manduchi, an associate professor of computer engineering whose research includes work on assistive technology. Assistive technology refers to equipment that allows people with disabilities to function in the day-to-day world. Universal access is the goal of assistive technology, which seeks to enable everyone, disabled or not, to communicate and participate in society.</p><p>According to Manduchi, the new course is unique in that it addresses both the technological aspects of disabilities and the implications of disability on a personal and societal level.</p><p>"There is some technology involved, because this is an engineering course. But mostly the emphasis is on understanding the physiology, psychology, and sociology of disability," Manduchi said. </p><p>The course is aimed at anyone interested in the subject, but will be required for those pursuing UCSC's new bioengineering major. Called Universal Access: Disability, Technology, and Society, it will be offered every year and has no prerequisites. The students who are taking the class this year are evenly distributed among engineering, social sciences, humanities, and physical and biological sciences, Manduchi said.</p><p>The class incorporates invited guest lecturers to give the students as many perspectives on disability as possible. These include experts who study disability, professionals who work with people with disabilities, and disabled people themselves. Manduchi himself spent almost 10 years working on robot vision before deciding to apply that knowledge to helping blind people. He thought it would be easy, but soon learned otherwise. </p><p>"Most engineers are like me. They start proposing solutions to the problem of disability without knowing what the problems are," Manduchi said. "After a while, I realized that you could not start from an engineering point of view. You need to talk to people and understand all the issues that go along with disability. Then you can start trying to solve the problem."</p><p>In his research, Manduchi addresses the problem of blindness by engineering equipment that helps blind people sense their environment. He developed what he calls a "laser cane" that can sense obstacles in a person's path. He is also working on a computer mouse that translates onscreen features into tactile sensations, like the feedback sensors on some video-game controllers. Another project involves using the camera and computer in a cellular phone to "look" for things like bathrooms and elevators in an unfamiliar environment. </p><p>Peggy Church, director of the Disability Resource Center on campus, and her staff provided resources and information that helped Manduchi design the new course. Church called the class an important contribution to broadening students' awareness of disability. </p><p>"When people think of diversity, they think of ethnic diversity and gender, but not about disability," she said. </p><p>The course includes a project that requires students to immerse themselves in a facet of the disability issue. Manduchi said this could include learning some American Sign Language or spending 24 hours with a person with a disability. Manduchi said he hopes that his course will give students an opportunity to explore a field and an issue they might otherwise not have thought about.</p><p>"I think the right way to deal with disability is knowledge: getting to know what disability means and entails," Manduchi said. </p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Roberto Manduchi at (831) 459-1479 or manduchi@soe.ucsc.edu.

An Open House on Friday, February 23, will kick off a series of events over the next few months to mark this milestone in the development of UCSC's first professional school.</p><p>The Open House, scheduled from 2 to 4 p.m., will include lab tours, research presentations, raffle prizes, refreshments, and other festivities in the Engineering Courtyard and nearby buildings. Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal, Engineering Dean Steve Kang, and Jack Baskin, whose $5 million gift helped launch the school a decade ago, will make brief remarks starting at 3:30 p.m. </p><p>In the months ahead, the Baskin School will also be hosting a distinguished lecture series, a research poster symposium, and other events to celebrate 10 years of achievements and the creation of an engineering school poised to tackle the challenges of the 21st century.</p><p>Launched in 1997, the Baskin School of Engineering was built on the foundation of two strong programs--the Departments of Computer Science and Computer Engineering. It has since grown to include five departments, with more in the planning stages, and the number of faculty has grown from 25 to 72. </p><p>"We have been most fortunate to have been able to recruit outstanding faculty members. Their achievements in research and teaching serve as a magnet to attract more students and more support from industry and grants," Kang said. "With equally outstanding staff, plus energetic students who are an inspiration to both faculty and staff, we have built a strong team in the Baskin School of Engineering."</p><p>Engineering faculty have developed innovative programs that cross disciplinary boundaries, pioneering new areas of research and creating exciting opportunities for students. New buildings completed in 2004--the award-winning Engineering 2 and the Baskin Engineering Auditorium--have greatly expanded the school's research and teaching facilities.</p><p>During 10 years of rapid progress, the Baskin School of Engineering has developed a unique interdisciplinary focus with programs in three strategic areas: information technology, biotechnology, and nanotechnology. The school has also spearheaded UCSC's Silicon Valley initiatives, serving the needs of the high-technology industry by creating new graduate programs for engineers offered through the campus's Silicon Valley Center.</p><p>"Over the next ten years, we will continue to build our interdisciplinary programs and establish a strong presence in Silicon Valley," said Michael Isaacson, professor and chair of electrical engineering and science director for the University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) at NASA Ames Research Center. </p><p>The Bio-Info-Nano Research and Development Institute (BIN-RDI) at the campus's Silicon Valley Center is an especially exciting new development, he said. The institute is establishing a broad partnership of government, academia, and industry focusing on the convergence of biotechnology, information technology, and nanotechnology.</p><p>"The BIN-RDI is fostering new and productive ties between UCSC researchers, Silicon Valley industry, and other institutions in the region," Isaacson said.</p><p>According to Kang, the engineering school owes much of its rapid progress to the critical role played by retired engineer and philanthropist Jack Baskin, a UCSC Foundation trustee, and his wife Peggy Downes Baskin, who have provided crucial support throughout the development of UCSC's engineering program. Baskin's gifts to the school that bears his name now total nearly $8 million, and his contributions were recognized in 2006 when he was inducted into the Silicon Valley Hall of Fame. </p><p>"As dean, I am immensely grateful to Jack and Peggy Baskin. They are truly leaving a legacy in building the Baskin School of Engineering," Kang said.</p><p>Kang, who has been appointed to serve as the new chancellor of UC Merced starting in March, said his appointment reflects well on the accomplishments of the engineering school as a whole. </p><p>"Collectively we have done a good job in building the Baskin School of Engineering at UCSC, and that has earned the confidence of the UC system," he said.</p><p>For more information about the engineering school's 10th anniversary celebrations, visit the web site at <a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/events/tenth/calendar">http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/events/tenth/calendar</a> or contact the school at (831) 459-2158 or drecept@soe.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9150cd348072704601a012ffe345454d"><name>1054</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC's New Teacher Center receives $175,000 from MetLife Foundation to fund next generation of mentoring tools</title><summary>MetLife Foundation has awarded $175,000 to the New Teacher Center at the University of California, Santa Cruz, as part of the foundation's Teacher Development and Retention Initiative.</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>moir, new teacher center, mentor, education, teaching, teach, NTC</keywords><description>MetLife Foundation has awarded $175,000 to the New Teacher Center at the University of California, Santa Cruz, as part of the foundation's Teacher Development and Retention Initiative.</description><start-date>1171609200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC's New Teacher Center...</display-name><path>/2007/02/1054</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/02/1054</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338245868</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338245868</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Education</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>SANTA CRUZ, CA--MetLife Foundation has awarded $175,000 to the New Teacher Center at the University of California, Santa Cruz, as part of the foundation's Teacher Development and Retention Initiative. The $1 million initiative addresses the critical needs of new teachers who benefit from strong professional support as they work to raise student achievement.</p><p>The New Teacher Center (NTC) helps school districts across the country launch teacher induction programs that transform the early career experience of new teachers. NTC trains exemplary teachers to mentor first- and second-year teachers in their classrooms. Mentors focus on improving instructional practice rather than just survival during the challenging first years in teaching. </p><p>The MetLife award will fund the development of a new generation of mentor trainings, tools, and videos that will help new teachers integrate effective strategies throughout academic content areas. The award will also fund the creation of new strategies to help new teachers who work with students who are learning English.</p><p>"The nation's students most in need of outstanding instruction are often taught by new teachers," said NTC Executive Director Ellen Moir. "This award will help us offer these dedicated and enthusiastic new teachers the support they need to thrive."</p><p>Five organizations were awarded grants on a competitive basis to develop projects in response to the findings of <i>The MetLife Survey of the American Teacher, 2006: Expectations and Experiences.</i> An emphasis was placed on projects that will promote alignment between teacher education programs and classroom practice; develop and enhance new teachers' skills; and strengthen relationships among schools, teachers, students, and families.</p><p>"With almost half of new teachers today leaving the profession within their first five years, we need to address what needs to be done to support our nation's schools and keep good people in them," said Sibyl Jacobson, president of MetLife Foundation. </p><p>MetLife Foundation supports programs that increase opportunities for young people to succeed, give students and teachers a voice in improving education, create connections between schools and communities, and develop leadership. The foundation works with national nonprofit organizations to develop a variety of initiatives, many of which address issues raised each year in The MetLife Survey of the American Teacher.

The first published analysis of the overall state of environmental disparity in the nine-county region, the report is entitled, "Still Toxic After All These Years... Air Quality and Environmental Justice in the Bay Area."</p><p>"Despite more than 20 years of activism and research, environmental inequality is unfortunately alive and well in the Bay Area," said study coauthor Manuel Pastor, director of CJTC and a professor of Latin American and Latino studies at UCSC.</p><p>The study documented environmental disparity by analyzing several different databases on toxic air emissions and concentrations from stationary facilities, such as factories and refineries, as well as mobile sources, like traffic. These data were combined with neighborhood demographics from the 2000 Census, including income levels, ethnicity, and language fluency. It covered the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma. </p><p>Among the key findings:</p><p>. Two-thirds of residents who live within one mile of an EPA Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) facility are people of color, while nearly two-thirds of people who live more than 2.5 miles are white.</p><p>. Recent immigrants are nearly twice as likely to live within one mile of a TRI facility as they are to live 2.5 miles away from one. </p><p>. Although the likelihood of living near a TRI facility declines as income rises, racial disparity exists at every level of income. </p><p>"The patterns are clear and indisputable," said Pastor. "Even after controlling for income, land use, and other variables that are frequently used to explain away disparate patterns of exposure, communities of color face greater exposure to air pollution and toxics. They bear a disproportionate burden and face greater hazards and risks than others in the Bay Area."</p><p>Pastor called for a comprehensive approach that focuses on reducing persistent inequalities and preventing exposures and health risks before they occur. "Surely, the Bay Area can develop an environmental justice policy that leads the state," he said. "As we witnessed in the Katrina disaster, leaving some of us less protected ultimately poses environmental risks for everyone."</p><p>The report also presents estimates of cumulative lifetime cancer and respiratory risks associated with ambient air toxics exposure. Based on assumptions about ambient exposures and toxicity, rather than actual cancer or respiratory cases, the estimates are useful for comparing the overall pollution burdens between neighborhoods and clarifying what the implications may be for health, said Pastor. </p><p>Areas at higher risk for cancer and respiratory hazards have higher proportions of minority and immigrant residents, as well as higher percentages of land devoted to industrial, commercial, and transportation uses, the authors found.</p><p>"In the Bay Area, more than 70 percent of estimated cancer risk from ambient air toxics comes from traffic," he said. Many neighborhoods are already well over the regulatory goal of 10 cancers in a million that is used in regulating new facilities, pointing out the need for a cumulative approach to exposure management. "A little risk here, a little risk there, and soon you have health risks that are orders of magnitude above the benchmarks considered to be of regulatory concern," said Pastor.</p><p>Among the policy guidelines discussed in the report:</p><p>. Consider cumulative impacts because air pollution and environmental hazards may accumulate and interact to impact community health in ways that are poorly understood.</p><p>. Consider social vulnerability because evidence suggests that environmental hazards have gravitated over time to places with the least economic, social, and political power.</p><p>. Promote meaningful community participation to generate trust and help regulators, activists, and policy makers establish common ground.</p><p>	. Take meaningful action to protect the public health.</p><p>The authors also called on the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) to increase access to critical data sets and emissions inventories and to collaborate more with cities, counties, and public stakeholders to expand its inventories to include unregulated sources.</p><p>Finally, as environmental cleanup expands and property values increase, Pastor issued a plea on behalf of current residents and activists, who could be displaced by the tides of gentrification. "Those who have suffered through the toxic soup for years should be among those to reap the rewards from a new commitment to environmental justice," said Pastor.</p><p>In addition to Pastor, the report was coauthored by James Sadd, associate professor of environmental science at Occidental College, and Rachel Morello-Frosch, an assistant professor at the Center for Environmental Studies and the Department of Community Health at Brown University. The study was a partnership of CJTC and the Bay Area Environmental Health Collaborative (BAEHC), with support from the California Endowment, the California Wellness Foundation, the San Francisco Foundation, and the W. K. Kellogg Foundation.</p><p>#####</p><p>Note to journalists: Manuel Pastor can be reached at (831) 459-5919 or via e-mail at <a href="mailto:mpastor@ucsc.edu">mpastor@ucsc.edu</a>.

They also examined recent advertising campaigns and merchandising of products aimed toward girls.</p><p>      </p><p>Sexualization was defined by the task force as occurring when a person's value comes only from her/his sexual appeal or behavior, to the exclusion of other characteristics, and when a person is sexually objectified, e.g., made into a thing for another's sexual use.</p><p>      </p><p>Examples of the sexualization of girls in all forms of media abound, including visual media and other forms of media such as music lyrics. And, according to the report, such examples have likely increased in number as "new media" have been created and access to media has become omnipresent. The influence and attitudes of parents, siblings, and friends can also add to the pressures of sexualization.</p><p>      </p><p> "The consequences of the sexualization of girls in media today are very real and are likely to be a negative influence on girls' healthy development," says Eileen L. Zurbriggen, Ph.D., chair of the APA Task Force and an associate professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "We have ample evidence to conclude that sexualization has negative effects in a variety of domains, including cognitive functioning, physical and mental health, and healthy sexual development."</p><p>Research evidence shows that the sexualization of girls negatively affects girls and young women across a variety of health domains:</p><p>. Cognitive and Emotional Consequences: Sexualization and objectification undermine a person's confidence in and comfort with her own body, leading to emotional and self-image problems, such as shame and anxiety.</p><p>. Mental and Physical Health: Research links sexualization with three of the most common mental health problems diagnosed in girls and women: eating disorders, low self-esteem, and depression or depressed mood.</p><p>. Sexual Development: Research suggests that the sexualization of girls has negative consequences on girls' ability to develop a healthy sexual self-image.</p><p>According to the task force report, parents can play a major role in contributing to the sexualization of their daughters or can play a protective and educative role. The APA report calls on parents, school officials, and all health professionals to be alert for the potential impact of sexualization on girls and young women. Schools, the APA says, should teach media literacy skills to all students and should include information on the negative effects of the sexualization of girls in media literacy and sex education programs.</p><p>      </p><p> "As a society, we need to replace all of these sexualized images with ones showing girls in positive settings--ones that show the uniqueness and competence of girls," states Zurbriggen. "The goal should be to deliver messages to all adolescents, boys and girls, that lead to healthy sexual development."</p><p>#####</p><p>Full text of the Executive Summary, Report, and tips on "What Parents Can Do" are available at: <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/wpo/sexualization.html">http://www.apa.org/pi/wpo/sexualization.html</a>.</p><p>      </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9150d3a58072704601a012ffd0b98c7c"><name>1058</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Rep.

The chair supports an area of interest to Downes Baskin, a research associate in UCSC's feminist studies program.</p><p>The Jack Baskin Endowed Chair in Technology and Information Management will be held by the faculty member who directs the Technology and Information Management Program in the Baskin School of Engineering. With this gift, Baskin's donations to the engineering school that bears his name now total more than $8 million. </p><p>"These two chairs support the very best of UC Santa Cruz: innovative programs and a creative approach to discovery involving faculty from multiple disciplines," said Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal. "The campus is again benefiting from Jack and Peggy Baskin's support for key programs and initiatives that advance our mission and enhance the quality and impact of UCSC."</p><p>Technology and information management is a new and distinct discipline within engineering, combining technology management, systems engineering, and information technology. The Baskin School of Engineering is developing M.S. and Ph.D. programs in this field, complementing its undergraduate program in Information Systems Management, and the school plans to establish a Department of Technology and Information Management. Graduates of these academic programs will have a solid  technology base from engineering and information technology, coupled with an understanding of the functions of business enterprises. </p><p>"I am extremely excited and pleased that we will have an endowed professorship in Technology and Information Management. This will be of great help in recruiting an outstanding senior faculty member to take over as chair of this program," said Patrick Mantey, the Baskin Professor of Computer Engineering. "I know and appreciate, as a Baskin Chair holder, the value of a chair in faculty recruitment and retention, for the financial support it provides with discretionary funds, and for the associated prestige."</p><p>Ethics is another area with cross-disciplinary ramifications that has received increasing attention at UCSC. Ellen Suckiel, provost of Stevenson College and a professor of philosophy, teaches a bioethics course that attracts students from across the divisions and is required for some majors, including the engineering school's new bioengineering major. </p><p>"The new, generously funded Peggy Downes Baskin Humanities Chair for Interdisciplinary Ethics will enable the UCSC campus to become an international leader in addressing the major ethical and humanistic questions of our time, and the privileged venue for the articulation of creative solutions to the perceived crisis in values said to reign in postindustrial and technologically advanced societies," said humanities dean Georges Van Den Abbeele.</p><p>Downes Baskin said she has long been interested in the ethical issues that arise in many different fields.</p><p>"There are so many areas in which ethical problems arise--in journalism, politics, medicine--and the endowed chair emphasizes the need to address these issues in a cross-disciplinary context," she said.</p><p>Downes Baskin coauthored the 2003 book <i>Beyond Superwoman,</i> which explores the lives of successful female executives in Silicon Valley. She helped create and fund UCSC's Girls in Engineering program, a summer school program designed to encourage interest in engineering among seventh- and eighth-grade girls from throughout Santa Cruz County. Downes Baskin taught politics at Santa Clara University for 18 years and has also taught women's studies at UCSC.</p><p>Jack Baskin chaired the UC Santa Cruz Foundation for two years and remains a Foundation trustee. He will be among the speakers at an Open House celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Baskin School of Engineering on Friday, February 23 (see <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1052">press release</a>). In addition to these latest gifts to the campus, the Baskins have given generously to support instruction in the arts, the Institute of Marine Sciences, Shakespeare Santa Cruz, an endowed chair in psychology, a scholarship in literature, and other departments. The Baskins live in Santa Cruz and Carmel.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> If you would like to interview the Baskins or UCSC administrators about these gifts, please contact Tim Stephens in the Public Information Office at (831) 459-4352 or <a href="mailto:stephens@ucsc.edu">stephens@ucsc.edu</a>.

Filer sees more than his share of cases involving murder, drugs, and gang violence. As a product of the same neighborhood, Filer is a powerful role model who has devoted himself to "reaching out and helping others as I've been helped."</p><p>The public is invited to a free talk on Monday, March 12, during which Filer will address the topic, "What is Our Legacy?" The talk, which will begin at 7:30 p.m., will take place in the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room at UC Santa Cruz. </p><p>Today's youth suffer from what Filer calls "cultural amnesia."</p><p>"It's like young people have forgotten--or were never taught or exposed to--all those people who came before us who had much more difficult problems, and they didn't let those problems stop them," said Filer. "It's particularly true for youth, especially African American youth."</p><p>Filer is a popular public speaker in Compton elementary and high school classrooms, where he encourages young people to stay in school and prepare for college. "I think we need to do a better job explaining the value of education, especially among students of color," he said. "All of us have that obligation. As I always say, I may not be able to change the world, but I want to help change my corner of it."</p><p>Filer, a 1977 graduate of UCSC, is returning to campus to accept the second annual Distinguished Social Sciences Alumni Award. </p><p>"Through his work on behalf of the city of Los Angeles and the state of California, Judge Filer has made exemplary contributions to society," said Sheldon Kamieniecki, dean of the Division of Social Sciences at UCSC. "He brings enduring honor to UC Santa Cruz, and we are pleased to recognize his dedication as a judge, his volunteer efforts in public schools, and his years of positive community involvement." </p><p>Filer was the unanimous choice of the committee of three faculty members, three alumni, and two students who reviewed nominations submitted by faculty, staff, and alumni. The first award was presented last year to Dana Priest, the <i>Washington Post</i> reporter who won a 2006 Pulitzer Prize for breaking the story about the CIA's secret overseas prisons. </p><p>Filer grew up in the Compton neighborhood during the 1960s and attributes much of his success to his parents. "Higher education was not an option in my family, it was expected," said Filer, who earned a B.A. in politics from UCSC and graduated from UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law. He worked in the state Public Defender's Office in Los Angeles before entering private practice in Compton. He moved to the bench in 1993 and was named to the California Superior Court in 2002 by then-Governor Gray Davis.</p><p>A high-resolution photo of Kelvin Filer is available <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/img/2007/02/filer_kelvin.jpg.zip">here</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9150dcb38072704601a012ff7ab737bb"><name>1064</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Winter 2007 Staff Brown Bag Forum</title><start-date>1172127600000</start-date><display-name>Winter 2007 Staff Brown...</display-name><path>/2007/02/1064</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/02/1064</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338249846</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338249846</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Staff Advisory Board will host the winter-quarter Staff "Brown Bag" Open Forum with Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal on Tuesday, February 27, from 12:30 to 1:40 p.m., in Classroom Unit 2.</p>

<p>"It was the best thing I ever did," says Bruce, a graduate of Santa Cruz High School. "I wanted to study. I wanted to learn how to think."</p>
<p>Bruce lived on campus and spent his first year playing "major-of-the month," before deciding on economics and discovering politics professor Robert Meister. For Bruce, the combination of economics, politics, math, and philosophy was the key that unlocked the door to learning.</p>
<p>"You can take economics, but unless you take math, too, the lights don't come on," says Bruce, who earned a B.A. in economics in 1979.</p>
<p>Bruce channeled what he learned into a fast-moving and rewarding career in asset management, investing billions of dollars for some of the biggest banks and financial institutions in the world. He recently reconnected with UCSC, where he is opening doors for students by funding a fellowship for aspiring high school math and science teachers, and creating a fellowship for graduate students in politics.</p>
<p>"I was thinking through how you can help people, and it's really education," says Bruce. "I don't have a lot of time for runaround, and I got zero runaround when I called UCSC."</p>
<p>Engaging and personable, Bruce is as comfortable in Gap and Banana Republic as he is in Brooks Brothers, despite a globe-hopping executive lifestyle that includes frequent travel from his home base in Los Angeles to London, Tokyo, and Sydney.</p>
<p>After graduation, Bruce says he headed to San Francisco "armed with my Marxist economics and Birkenstocks to work at Wells Fargo Bank." It was his grandmother's idea to work for a bank, which she said provided the ultimate job security--once hired, she was certain, he'd never have to look for another job. But Bruce soon began looking around, and at the suggestion of a friend, left Wells Fargo for Stanford Research Institute. Fascinated by how people make decisions under uncertainty, he attended classes in applied math, optimization, and decision analysis at Stanford's business and engineering schools.</p>
<p>Bruce first worked in financial analysis and risk management at World Savings in Oakland, where his career began to take off. He eventually got involved in capital markets, working in fixed income and dealing with New York banks and ultimately reuniting with his Cowell College buddy Craig Schiffer at Lehman Brothers in New York.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, the bank loan market was just opening up, and Bruce was in the right place at the right time. He and partners Christopher Damico and David Forbes-Nixon struck gold in 2002 when they founded Alcentra, an international asset management group with offices in Los Angeles and London that caters to institutions all over the world. Their clients, whose names Bruce declines to reveal, count on them to manage funds in excess of $12 billion.</p>
<p>Alcentra didn't start in a garage, like Hewlett-Packard, but Bruce describes his ascent to the top of the financial pyramid with a Santa Cruz-style casualness.</p>
<p>"When we wrote up our original business plan, we figured there was virtually no way we'd hit the numbers, but we did," he says. "We blew through them. It was a huge success."</p>
<p>Even the name of the company was the product of Damico's imagination. "I think it sounds like the name of a minivan or a pharmaceutical company," quips Bruce.</p>
<p>But there's nothing make-believe about Alcentra. Last year, the Bank of New York acquired an 80 percent interest in the company for an undisclosed amount; Bruce and his cofounders retained a 20 percent interest. All three remain engaged in the company--they're contemplating a New York presence, and the Bank of New York recently acquired Mellon Bank, which could greatly expand the scope of their operations.</p>
<p>Bruce and his wife, Mona, are also busy raising two young sons, Kellen and Ryder. Their gift of $157,500 created the Mark Bruce Fellowship for Math &amp; Science Teachers at UCSC in honor of his brother, who died in the September 11 attacks on New York City. "He was on the 102nd floor of the first tower. He didn't make it out," says Bruce.</p>
<p>The fellowship will support UCSC graduates of math, science, or engineering who enroll in the California Teach Program through UCSC's master's/teaching credential program.</p>
<p>Bruce also established the Robert Meister Scholars Fund to support graduate students in politics at UCSC and honor his professor. His gift of $250,000 will make it possible for a $50,000 fellowship to be awarded to a different student pursuing a Ph.D. in politics each year for five years.</p>
<p>Although Bruce's parents have moved out of Santa Cruz and he hasn't stayed in touch with the campus, Bruce is eager to reconnect. In addition to Meister, he has fond memories of taking classes with economics professors Alan Richards, Donald Wittman, and John Isbister and philosophy professor Carlos NoreÃ±a--some of the educators who helped teach him "how to think."</p>
<p>"When you combine economics with game theory and decision theory, you start to learn how people think," says Bruce. "If you combine that with probability, you see how people make decisions. Having things go your way is really just consistently making good decisions and accurately assessing what the outcomes may be."</p>

Sloan Foundation has selected three UCSC faculty members to receive 2007 Sloan Research Fellowships: Yi Zuo, assistant professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology; Dimitris Achlioptas, assistant professor of computer science; and Alexander Gamburd, assistant professor of mathematics. </p><p>The Sloan awards are intended to enhance the careers of the very best young faculty members in specified fields of science. This year, a total of 116 fellowships were awarded in seven fields--chemistry, computational and evolutionary molecular biology, computer science, economics, mathematics, neuroscience, and physics. Each award includes a $45,000 grant that provides unrestricted support for research. </p><p>Zuo's research revolves around the communication between two classes of cells in the nervous system: neurons and glia. Despite the fact that glia constitute the majority of cells in the nervous system, their roles in neural circuitry have only begun to be understood. Zuo plans to use modern imaging techniques and molecular manipulation to study glia-neuron communication and understand how glia are involved in learning and memory. This research could suggest ways to manipulate brain function through modulating glial signals and lead to potential treatments for various neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>Achlioptas's research in computer science addresses what are known as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). The popular number game Sudoku is a classic example of a CSP, where the variables are the contents of the empty squares, and the constraints arise from the rules of the game and contents of the filled-in squares. CSPs conceptually similar to Sudoku are found in many areas ranging from biology and biochemistry to software verification and airplane design, Achlioptas said. But while Sudoku problems can be solved in milliseconds by a computer using exhaustive search techniques, most real-life CSPs could not be solved that way. Achlioptas's work is aimed at designing algorithms for solving real-life CSPs using ideas inspired by statistical physics. </p><p>Gamburd's research in mathematics concerns spectral problems in number theory, probability, and combinatorics. He is particularly interested in problems related to random matrices and expander graphs.</p><p>One of the oldest fellowship  programs in the country, the Sloan Research Fellowship Program began in 1955 as a means of encouraging research by young scholars at a critical time in their careers. The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, a philanthropic nonprofit institution, was established in 1934 by Alfred P. Sloan Jr., the president and chief executive officer of the General Motors Corporation.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9150e28d8072704601a012ffbc4ea36f"><name>1068</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC biologist Terrie Williams wins 2007 Women of Discovery Award</title><summary>Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, joins Jane Goodall and three other scientists as winners of the 2007 Women of Discovery Awards from Wings WorldQuest.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Terrie Williams</keywords><description>Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, joins Jane Goodall and three other scientists as winners of the 2007 Women of Discovery Awards from Wings WorldQuest.</description><start-date>1172473200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC biologist Terrie Williams...</display-name><path>/2007/02/1068</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/02/1068</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338251349</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338251349</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/02/images/williams_terrie.72.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/02/images/williams_terrie.72.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>williams_terrie.72.jpg</name><file-size>42102</file-size><width>150</width><height>177</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Terrie Williams</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, joins Jane Goodall and three other scientists as winners of the 2007 Women of Discovery Awards from Wings WorldQuest.

While that may not sound like an essential skill, it's part of a popular program called "Expanding Your Horizons" designed to inspire girls' enthusiasm for math and science.</p>
<p>Now in its seventh year, the UCSC Expanding Your Horizons conference is sponsored by the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences' Academic Excellence (ACE) Program. Nancy Cox-Konopelski, director of the ACE Program, and a team of university and community volunteers organized the all-day event to encourage girls in grades eight through 12 to continue taking math and science classes.</p>
<p>Students attend two hands-on science workshops of their choice and hear talks from professional women in science. Jennifer Heldmann, a planetary scientist at NASA, will begin the day with a lecture titled "Planes, Trains, Cars and NASA Ames: An Exciting Journey of Math &amp; Science." Persis Drell, a physicist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, will end the day with her talk, "What in the Universe Is Going on?"</p>
<p>The students enjoy the speakers, but the workshops always steal the show, according to Cox-Konopelski. "Every year we've had really inspiring women who do a great job delivering their message. But when all is said and done, the girls like the hands-on activities best," she said.</p>
<p>In one workshop, girls will control electronic toys by licking lollipops with sensors embedded in them. They will also have the opportunity to build robots and circuits, simulate asteroids smashing into planets, and synthesize banana oil. Leading the workshops are women in science and engineering from throughout the region, including UCSC graduate students and scientists from Stanford University, Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.</p>
<p>Cox-Konopelski said she hopes the event will counteract the tendency for girls to drop science and math classes in high school.</p>
<p>"When they get to high school, girls start dropping out of science. It's not cool to be interested in math and science," said Cox-Konopelski. "We give girls a chance to do really cool and engaging things, and we do a little indoctrination along the way."</p>
<p>The program has been highly successful in previous years. Approximately 170 girls attended the event last year, and Cox-Konopelski said she expects more than 200 to attend this year.</p>
<p>"We get some students who aren't really interested in science--they want to be in business or even show business, but they enjoy the day. They learn something and have a good time," said Cox-Konopelski.</p>
<p>The EYH conference is part of a broader effort by the university to reach out to the Santa Cruz community. A related program known as GROW (Graduate and Seagate Researchers Offer Outreach Workshops) was implemented in October 2006. GROW allows UCSC graduate students to visit local classrooms and teach students about their research. Cox-Konopelski said these volunteers teach science and math through hands-on activities that teachers cannot offer because of a lack of time or resources.</p>
<p>"The idea is to make a connection between the campus and community and to keep students interested in science and math," Cox-Konopelski said.</p>

We hope you will join us in a dialogue about issues on</p><p>campus like: Diversity, Responses to Student Activism, Quality of Education, Funding, Student Services, and Administrative Sensitivity to student needs.  We know that some of these topics are very broad so it really is going to be up to students to share more specific examples and experiences in dealing with things like financial aid, advising, and/or transportation.</p><p>What we want is to hear the voices and see the faces of those who academic and University policy affects the most.  This event is open for students to step up to a microphone and address administrators who have agreed to be there (like the Chancellor), and each other, in an effort to confront these issues and look for possible solutions.  We strongly encourage all of you, as students, to come and share your experience at UCSC.  Your testimonials will illustrate what needs to be changed better than any speech can!  There will also be delicious FREE FOOD!  The Town Hall will be Wednesday, February 28th, at the Kresge Town Hall (Food 5:30-6:00 pm, Town Hall 6:00-8:30 pm).</p><p>We also know that, as students, you all have significant information. Knowing this, we will be providing a couple of tables for people to advertise their events or any information they feel is valuable.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Staff</audience><admin>The Student Union Assembly</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9150e6cd8072704601a012ffccc07597"><name>1071</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Photographer Frans Lanting presents "The Making of Life: A Journey through Time" on March 17</title><summary>Nature photographer Frans Lanting will share the story behind the making of his multimedia presentation &lt;i&gt;Life: A Journey through Time&lt;/i&gt; at an event on Saturday, March 17.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Frans Lanting, Kenneth Norris</keywords><description>Nature photographer Frans Lanting will share the story behind the making of his multimedia presentation &lt;i&gt;Life: A Journey through Time&lt;/i&gt; at an event on Saturday, March 17.</description><start-date>1172646000000</start-date><display-name>Photographer Frans Lanting presents...</display-name><path>/2007/02/1071</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/02/1071</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338252445</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338252445</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/02/images/lanting.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/02/images/lanting.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lanting.250.jpg</name><file-size>30119</file-size><width>250</width><height>171</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Frans Lanting photographing an erupting volcano in Hawaii. © Brad Lewis.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Nature photographer Frans Lanting will share the story behind the making of his multimedia presentation <em>Life: A Journey through Time</em> at an event on Saturday, March 17. Presentations of "The Making of <em>Life: A Journey through Time"</em> will take place at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. at the Rio Theatre in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Gary Griggs, director of UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences, will introduce Lanting at 2 p.m., and Julie Packard, executive director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, will introduce him at 7 p.m. Tickets for this event are $20 for general admission or $15 for Friends of Long Marine Lab members. For tickets or information, call (831) 459-3800. Tickets are also available at Logos Books &amp; Records in downtown Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the presentations will benefit the Seymour Marine Discovery Center's Ken Norris Memorial Lecture Series, which will begin in the fall of 2007. The lecture series is named in honor of the late Ken Norris, a professor of natural history who inspired Lanting and many other UCSC alumni.</p>
<p>"Ken's approach to natural history influenced many people, including myself, and that inspiration is evident in the <em>Life</em> project, which is an experiential way to explore natural history through time," Lanting said.</p>
<p>A world-renowned photographer and a photographer-in-residence at <em>National Geographic</em> magazine, Lanting will discuss how he created the acclaimed multimedia performance <em>Life: A Journey through Time.</em> The work, which has also been published as a book, consists of photographs from all over the planet that encapsulate and symbolize Earth's history, from hot springs that harbor ancient microbes to the complex ecosystems of the rain forest.</p>
<p><em>Life: A Journey through Time</em> premiered in Santa Cruz in July 2006. Lanting will tell behind-the-scenes stories and share video footage by his wife, Christine Eckstrom, who coproduced the show with Lanting.</p>
