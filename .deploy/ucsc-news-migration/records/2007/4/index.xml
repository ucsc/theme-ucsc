Before she crossed the border to live in Los Angeles at the age of eight, she lived in a cardboard shack with a dirt floor and no running water. She bathed in a dirty canal outside and survived on a diet of only beans and tortillas.</p>
<p>Overcoming the language barrier and her status as an undocumented immigrant in the United States, Grande made the most of her new home, eventually earning a bachelor's degree in creative writing/film &amp; video from UC Santa Cruz in 1999. For her senior project in UCSC's Literature Department, she even wrote the first 80 pages of her debut novel, <em>Across a Hundred Mountains.</em></p>
<p>The book is now required reading in core courses at UCSC's Porter and Kresge Colleges.</p>
<p><em>Across a Hundred Mountains</em> illustrates the perils of immigration and crossing the U.S. border, the heartbreaking cycle of poverty, and the fractured family ties and identities of those who make it to the other side. Inspired by her own life -- Grande's father left her to work in the U.S. when she was only a year old -- the novel was published in 2006 to critical acclaim.</p>
<p>As <em>People</em> magazine noted: "Grande's spare, elegantly written tale of a young Mexican girl searching for her farmworker father, missing since he left to seek his fortune in 'el otro lado', is a timely and riveting read."</p>
<p>That the novel is filled with details drawn from Grande's own life adds immeasurably to the poignancy of the story.</p>
<p>"The poverty -- that's very real to my experience," she says. "There's a scene where my character goes to the market and is picking up rotten vegetables out of the trash cans. My sister in Mexico had a habit of picking up things off the ground -- a lollipop or a piece of fruit -- and eating them, just because we didn't have any food."</p>
<p>"I wrote this story because all of the books that I read, especially those by Latino authors, never quite captured my own experience," Grande adds. "A lot of books deal with the children of immigrants -- what they go through and their identity as U.S.-born Latinos. I always felt a little left out because I wasn't born here, and these stories weren't reflecting my personal experience."</p>
<p>Grande decided to attend UCSC on the recommendation of an English teacher at Pasadena City College who thought it would be an ideal, intimate learning environment for her. "Every time she read my essays, she told me to be a writer," Grande recalls. "She steered me to UCSC because she thought it was a place where I could discover myself as a person."</p>
<p>After graduating, Grande was named a 2003 PEN USA Emerging Voices Fellow, which gave her access to free writing classes at UCLA, as well as the opportunity to meet with agents and publishers in the literary world. "That's how I met my agent," says Grande. "I approached her after she gave a presentation, told her about my book, and we soon began working together."</p>
<p>Now a U.S. citizen, Grande lives in Los Angeles with her four-year-old son. When she's not busy working on her next novel -- the story of four women in a Los Angeles-based folklorico group -- Grande helps other immigrants transition into the country by teaching adult English. "I feel really happy that I've been able to do all these things; I know if I stayed in Mexico, I wouldn't have been able to do anything meaningful with my life," she says. "Living in the United States has made me aim high and try to be an example for others."</p>
<p>Since <em>Across a Hundred Mountains</em> was published, Grande has given more than 30 readings in Los Angeles and across the Southwest, including several visits to creative writing classes at UCSC. In light of the recent debates in Congress and increased media focus on immigration, she hopes that her book will offer readers a unique perspective on the politically charged issue.</p>
<p>"Instead of building fences, the U.S. should deal with illegal immigration by helping Mexico improve its economy," observes Grande. "Because I experienced the poverty in Mexico, I understand why people are so desperate to come to this country. But even if you build a fence, people are still starving and will still want to come here; the risks will rise, but the people won't go away. It would be much more humane to help the people in Mexico so they would not be so desperate to come here."</p>

Photos by Nick Dunlop.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Three peregrine falcons released by the UC Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group are testing their wings around UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory under the watchful eyes of a group of UCSC students. Charged with monitoring the young falcons as they learn how to fly, feed themselves, and survive in the wild, the students peer through binoculars and spotting scopes and use radio-tracking equipment to keep track of the birds when they fly out of sight.</p><p>Supervising the operation is Glenn Stewart, a program manager for the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group (SCPBRG). The five-week old falcons, two brothers and a sister, arrived at the SCPBRG facilities at Long Marine Lab on March 14 from an East Bay aviary where they were hatched. For the first few days, the birds lived in a "hack box," a simulated nest site mounted in a stairwell of the Center for Ocean Health Building at Long Marine Lab. </p><p>Stewart and his fellow researchers opened the door of the hack box on March 17 to release the falcons. The actual release date, however, was left up to the falcons--they fledge, or fly from the nest for the first time, on their own timetable. Since fledging, they have been returning to the hack box daily for meals of quail left by the researchers. </p><p>A similar procedure awaits the birds expected to hatch from three eggs SCPBRG researchers rescued last week from a peregrine falcon nest on the San Francisco Bay Bridge. The rescue operation--carried out on March 30 amid a flurry of media attention--was necessary to ensure the survival of the fledglings. The bridge is an appealing nest site to adult peregrines, but it is a dangerous place for their young to fledge, Stewart said. Fledglings from bridge nests often end up drowning in the water below or being struck by cars on the bridge.</p><p>At Long Marine Lab, meanwhile, the released birds in their juvenile plumage are still gawky adolescents, clumsy on their first flights and unsure how to hunt. Once they learn how to fly, their 200-mile-per-hour dives as they hunt small birds will make them the fastest creatures on the planet. Reaching that level of skill is an instinctive process, but it takes time and practice.</p><p>During the first few weeks, Stewart's students mount a dusk-to-dawn watch to keep an eye on the falcons. The birds are all banded and tagged with temporary radio transmitters. Stewart shows the students how to operate the tracking equipment, but he maintains a learn-by-doing attitude toward the monitoring work.</p><p>"My approach is to let the students do it," Stewart said. "It's interesting and fun for them, and it gives them that extra point on their resume that is actual wildlife conservation experience."</p><p>Stewart said life for an adolescent falcon is full of dangers. Golden eagles, great horned owls, coyotes, and bobcats are all predators eager to take advantage of a falcon that hasn't quite figured out how to take off from the ground yet. Researchers watching hack boxes up in the mountains have to worry about those threats, while life in the more urban environment of Long Marine Lab has its own spectrum of dangers, including dogs, cars, and people. </p><p>Falcon watcher Stephanie Quihuiz, a UCSC junior majoring in environmental studies and biology, said houses and buildings are among the factors that make keeping track of the fledglings difficult.</p><p>"I think keeping an eye on them is more difficult in an urban area," Quihuiz said. "The other day, Glenn pulled one out of a trash can."</p><p>Stewart explains that the trash can incident happened on a rainy morning, when the falcon probably didn't know what to do with his wet feathers. When trying to land or perch on the trashcan, he lost control and fell into it. Once there, his damp plumage and the slick side of the garbage bag trapped him. "When I pulled him out, his feathers were all wet, and he smelled like a cup of coffee," Stewart said. </p><p>According to Stewart, a large proportion of young falcons don't survive their first year in the wild. This was an enormous challenge for conservation biologists, including those at SCPBRG, who fought to bring falcons back from the edge of extinction in the 1970s. Now, however, falcon populations are booming. No longer on the federal Endangered Species List, they remain on the state list and are fully protected. </p><p>During the population recovery effort, the UCSC group released nearly 800 captive-raised peregrine falcons into the wild. The group continues to release falcons at two sites in California every year as mitigation for potential impacts of human activities on nesting peregrine falcons and to salvage young from urban nest sites where fledgling survival is poor, as in the case of the Bay Bridge nest. The releases also provide an important opportunity for people to learn about peregrines and gain a better appreciation for the conservation of nature, Stewart said.</p><p>Releasing falcons at places like Long Marine Lab, where tour groups and other visitors to the Seymour Marine Discovery Center walk by all day long, is incredibly important, said Sandra Menzel, who has monitored previous falcon releases. Menzel graduated from UCSC last year with a degree in environmental studies and continues to work with SCPBRG on peregrine falcon research projects.</p><p>"If it's one kid every year who gets stoked about falcons, or raptors in general, it's worth it," she said. </p><p>Apparently, it's working. One of the students who monitored the falcons this year is Sarah Carvill, a senior in environmental studies who remembers coming out to hear Stewart talk about falcons when she was only five years old. Like the other student researchers, Carvill said that getting to know the birds and being forced to spend hours quietly observing nature were the best things about the experience.</p><p>"It's about getting beyond the 'magnificent birds of prey' idea and seeing them in the context of their world," Carvill said. "It's amazing to see how vulnerable and how clumsy they are, and to watch them trying to figure life out."</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Glenn Stewart at (831) 459-2466 or gstewart@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915135da8072704601a012ff2cff0778"><name>1145</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>2007 Chancellor's Achievement Awards for Diversity</title><start-date>1175583600000</start-date><display-name>2007 Chancellor's Achievement Awards...</display-name><path>/2007/04/1145</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/04/1145</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338272664</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338272664</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>You are invited to submit nominations for the 2007 UCSC Chancellor's Achievement Awards for Diversity.

<p>Jones will discuss the intersection of environmentalism and social equity on Wednesday, April 25, at 7 p.m. in the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room at UC Santa Cruz. The title of his talk is "Growing Greener, Growing Together: Sustainability, Social Justice, and the Future of the Progressive Movement."</p>
<p>Jones is a member of Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums's Green Economic Initiatives Task Force, which is championing the idea of aggressively attracting eco-friendly employment and businesses to inner-city Oakland. He is writing a book called "Green-Collar Jobs: How To Beat Global Warming, Cut Poverty &amp; Unite America," in which he places the poor and the disadvantaged at the center of a new, solution-based environmentalism. He is the founder and national executive director of the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights in Oakland, which focuses on positive alternatives to incarceration and violence in urban America.</p>
<p>"Van Jones is a powerful speaker with an inspiring, progressive message," said Manuel Pastor, professor of Latin American and Latino studies at UCSC and director of the Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community, which is bringing Jones to campus as its eighth annual spring speaker. "He represents a new generation of leadership that has learned not just to protest but also to prescribe and the importance of building bridges between unlikely allies."</p>
<p>Jones continues the legacy of the civil rights movement through steady and traditional one-on-one organizing while also embracing new tools, said Pastor, noting that Jones teamed up with MoveOn.org veteran James Rucker in the wake of Hurricane Katrina to create ColorOfChange.org, an e-activist community focused on black issues that is now the largest such online community in the United States.</p>
<p>Jones also convinced organizers of the United Nations' World Environment Day to let the Ella Baker Center lead the first-ever "social equity track" at the 2005 Green Cities International Summit in San Francisco, where the center announced its new "Reclaim The Future" initiative. The Oakland Apollo Alliance is now northern California's biggest clean-energy jobs coalition, said Pastor.</p>
<p>In 2002, Jones was named a "Global Leader of Tomorrow" at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland--three years after he was arrested in the 1999 Seattle protests against the World Trade Organization. He has served as a board member of the Rainforest Action Network and Bioneers.</p>

Selected works from the UCSC exhibit will be displayed at Tokyo Zokei University from May 17 to June 5, as well as at Kyoto University of Art and Design, June 11-30. </p><p>In exchange, the Sesnon Gallery will host an exhibition of faculty work from both of the Japanese universities in October 2008. </p><p>UCSC arts faculty are interested in how the Japanese implement technology with traditional methods. Faculty at Kyoto University of Art and Design employ a philosophy of "Kyoto Renaissance" in which they explore alternative methods through traditional techniques. Tokyo Zokei University practices the method and theory of "Zokei" or art and design education-matching developments in technology to the changing social structures in contemporary life. </p><p>The Japanese faculty artists are most interested in how UCSC creates, researches and teaches contemporary fine arts. This cross-cultural exhibition of works by arts faculty from different cultural backgrounds with diverse methodologies is designed to create a new vision based on the combined artistic expressions of all three universities. </p><p>The project was initiated at UCSC two years ago when Sesnon Gallery director Shelby Graham proposed an art exchange with other UC campuses at an Art Department faculty meeting. Assistant art professor Jimin Lee--who was then slated to have a solo show in Tokyo as well as deliver a lecture in Kyoto--suggested investigating the possibility of an international exchange during her trip abroad. While in Japan, Lee carried around a binder of samples of UCSC faculty work that Graham had put together for her, and she shared the portfolio with Japanese university officials who attended her events in both cities.  </p><p>Upon her return to Santa Cruz, Lee collaborated with her Art Department colleagues, Assistant Professor Jennifer Parker and Associate Professor E.G. Crichton, to submit a grant application to UCSC's Arts Research Institute to cover the shipping cost of the artwork plus travel expenses. They were awarded a $15,000 grant last year which will enable Lee and Crichton to attend the university exhibitions in both Tokyo and Kyoto. The two UCSC professors will participate in several lecture and panel events at the two schools during their visit.</p><p>Lee noted that the project has been a true collaborative effort--with both Japanese art faculty and also within the UCSC Art Department. She particularly cited the efforts of Parker, who came up with the name for the exhibition and handled the digital exchange of catalog images and all overseas shipping and transportation arrangements. </p><p>"It's a more complicated process than most people would imagine to set up this international exchange," Lee noted. "But the FUSE exhibit creates an opportunity to talk about how digital technology affects university art faculty-both our creative process and our teaching."</p><p>"It's all very exciting; the Japanese universities will be designing two giant folding posters containing the artwork of all 30 faculty artists involved," she added. </p><p>UCSC art faculty featured in the FUSE exhibition include Elliot Anderson, E.G. Crichton, Frank Galuszka, Melissa Gwyn, Dee Hibbert-Jones, Jimin Lee, Norman Locks, Jennie McDade, Ed Osborn, Jennifer Parker, Elizabeth Stephens, and Lewis Watts. The exhibit features digital works on paper; paintings with acrylic, mica, and ink-jet prints; DVDs projected on walls/monitors; and installation work. </p><p>The opening reception for the exhibit will take place on Wednesday, April 11, from 5 to 7 p.m. at the Sesnon Gallery, located at Porter College. There will also be a panel discussion with the artists on Tuesday, May 1, at 6:15 p.m. in the UCSC Media Theater. Admission is free and open to the public.

Pilcher's talk, "Studying Life in the Universe," will begin at 8 p.m. in Classroom Unit 1 on the UCSC campus. The event, sponsored by the UCSC chapter of the scientific research society Sigma Xi, is free and open to the public. For more information, call (831) 459-4121.</p><p>According to Pilcher, the field of astrobiology was born about a decade ago from a "perfect storm" of scientific developments and discoveries. A deepening understanding of the diversity of life on Earth, the first discoveries of planets around other stars, and a growing appreciation of the nature of extraterrestrial environments in our solar system all contributed to a recognition that the time was right to focus scientific and technological expertise on studying the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe. A cross-disciplinary community of researchers has since been created to pursue questions at the interfaces of microbiology, evolutionary biology, paleontology, geochemistry, astronomy, planetary science, and philosophy, to name just a few of the disciplines engaged. </p><p>The NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI) has played a major role in developing this community. Based at NASA Ames Research Center, NAI is a virtual institute currently comprising 12 U.S. teams with over 600 members and 6 international partner organizations. Pilcher's lecture will discuss the foundations of astrobiology and describe NAI's role in this rapidly developing field.</p><p>Pilcher served as senior scientist for astrobiology at NASA headquarters before coming to Ames as NAI director in 2006. He has a B.S. in chemistry from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn and a Ph.D. in chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. </p><p>While still a graduate student, Pilcher led scientific teams that discovered water ice in Saturn's rings and on three of Jupiter's Galilean satellites, including Europa, now a high-priority astrobiology exploration target because of its subsurface liquid water ocean. On receiving his Ph.D., he joined the faculty of the Institute for Astronomy (and later the Department of Physics and Astronomy) at the University of Hawaii, where he discovered and analyzed "weather" on Neptune and participated in the discovery of methane ice on Pluto. He also conducted research on Jupiter's plasma torus and served as a member of the imaging team of NASA's Galileo mission to Jupiter. Pilcher has received the NASA Exceptional Achievement Medal, numerous Group Achievement Awards, and an Ames Honor Award. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915142ff8072704601a012ff428f4a73"><name>1153</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC graduate student's research leads to environmental victory in Coronado Islands</title><summary>Graduate student Shaye Wolf's findings have helped save endangered seabirds from the potentially devastating effects of a liquified natural gas facility planned for a site in Baja California.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>seabirds, Shaye Wolf, Donald Croll, Bernie Tershy</keywords><description>Graduate student Shaye Wolf's findings have helped save endangered seabirds from the potentially devastating effects of a liquified natural gas facility planned for a site in Baja California.</description><start-date>1176188400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC graduate student's research...</display-name><path>/2007/04/1153</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/04/1153</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338276039</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338276039</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/04/images/shaye_wolf.bc.72.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/04/images/shaye_wolf.bc.72.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>shaye_wolf.bc.72.jpg</name><file-size>46507</file-size><width>200</width><height>253</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Shaye Wolf studies seabird breeding colonies off the coasts of California and Mexico.

Photo by Shaye Wolf.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As part of her research for a master's degree in ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, graduate student Shaye Wolf documented the large and diverse populations of seabirds that nest on the Coronado Islands, a group of small islands off the coast of Baja California, just south of the Mexican border. Now, Wolf's findings have helped save those seabirds from the potentially devastating effects of a liquified natural gas facility that Chevron was planning to build next to the islands.</p><p>Wolf, now working on a Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology, began studying seabirds in Baja California in 2000. Her master's thesis involved assessing the status of seabird populations along the Pacific coast of the United States and Mexico--conducting surveys of breeding populations, compiling data from previous studies, and reviewing the conservation status of seabird species. </p><p>"My findings highlighted the importance of those islands along the Mexican coast," Wolf said. "They have not been studied much, but they have huge numbers of seabirds and enormous diversity."</p><p>While she was doing research there, she learned of Chevron's plans to build a liquified natural gas (LNG) terminal less than 700 yards from the south island of the Coronado Islands. The island has breeding colonies of six threatened or endangered bird species, including the largest known colony of the rare Xantus's murrelet, a small seabird listed as endangered under Mexican law and threatened in California. The murrelets and four other species that nest on the island are nocturnal, and Wolf was especially concerned about the effects of the terminal's lights. </p><p>"These nocturnal seabirds are very sensitive to artificial light," she said. "I knew from my research that even a single light bulb would attract birds--they circle lights like moths, they fly into lighted structures, and lights make them more vulnerable to predators. The tremendous amount of lighting from the terminals and tankers would be devastating."</p><p>In addition, Wolf said, the LNG terminal would take up 100 million gallons of seawater daily, killing larvae and other small organisms in the water and disrupting a highly productive marine ecosystem that supports not only the seabirds but also fish and other marine life around the islands.</p><p>"It doesn't make sense to put a big industrial facility the size of a football field right next to a biodiversity hot spot," Wolf said.</p><p>Mexican environmental groups were also opposed to the terminal and had challenged the environmental assessment and the validity of the permits issued to Chevron by the Mexican government. But their efforts were not successful, and by 2005 the groups had exhausted their legal options in the Mexican courts.</p><p>At that point, another UCSC graduate student entered the picture--Wolf's husband Doug Bevington, a doctoral candidate in sociology studying environmental advocacy groups. Bevington knew of a lawyer who had mounted a cross-border challenge in another environmental case through a commission set up under a side agreement of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The NAFTA Commission for Environmental Cooperation was established to keep companies from evading environmental regulations in one country by moving operations to a country with fewer restrictions. </p><p>Bevington contacted the lawyer--Jay Tutchton, director of the Environmental Law Clinical Partnership at the University of Denver--who agreed to help file a petition with the NAFTA Commission. Wolf wrote the science portion of the petition, and Tutchton, working pro bono, wrote the legal portion. Bevington pulled together a coalition of environmental groups that joined in the petition, including the Center for Biological Diversity, Greenpeace Mexico, American Bird Conservancy, Los Angeles Audubon, Pacific Environment, and WildCoast.</p><p>They submitted the petition in May 2005, and the commission agreed to look into the case. In January of this year, the commission recommended an investigation into whether Mexico had violated its own environmental laws in approving Chevron's proposal. That led to Chevron's announcement in March that it was abandoning its plans to build the LNG facility at the Coronado Islands site.</p><p>"This was a major environmental victory, and Shaye Wolf's seabird data were critical to the argument that the islands should be protected," said Bernie Tershy, assistant adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC and one of Wolf's academic advisers. </p><p>Wolf, however, insists that she was just one person in a large group of people and organizations that contributed to the effort. </p><p>"A lot of people worked to stop the terminal from different angles, and that joint effort was really successful," she said. "Doug [Bevington] identified the legal tool that enabled us to challenge the environmental violations of a big multinational company and the Mexican government. As a result, we were able to help the birds."</p><p>Another key petitioner was Alfonso Aguirre, who directs Conservación de Islas in Mexico, an offshoot of the Island Conservation and Ecology Group (ICEG) based at UCSC's Center for Ocean Health. Tershy and Wolf's other adviser, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology Donald Croll, founded ICEG as a nonprofit devoted to protecting and restoring island ecosystems. </p><p>Wolf's research on seabird populations supports the group's efforts. For her master's thesis, she compared the islands of Baja California with the islands off the coast of California in terms of seabird populations and investments in conservation.</p><p>"I found that there are ten times more seabirds on the Mexican islands, yet the investment in conservation programs to protect them is just a fraction of that in California," she said. </p><p>Those findings laid the foundation for a proposal to create a protected natural area for the Baja California Pacific islands, including the Coronado Islands. Mexican lawmakers have passed a resolution endorsing such a reserve, although the official designation has not yet been authorized, Wolf said.</p><p>For her Ph.D., Wolf is studying the Cassin's auklet, a widely distributed seabird found along the Pacific coast from Baja California to Alaska. She is looking at the influence of oceanographic variability on survival and reproductive success of Cassin's auklets and comparing populations in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. </p><p>Cassin's auklet is one of several species of seabirds affected by unusual ocean conditions in 2005 that led to large numbers of dead birds washing ashore in California. As part of her research, Wolf is working with scientists in UCSC's Climate Change and Impacts Laboratory, led by professor of Earth and planetary sciences Lisa Sloan, and using a regional climate model of the California Current system to see how predicted oceanographic effects of climate change might affect seabirds.</p><p>"I want to establish how seabirds, and in particular Cassin's auklets, are affected by the current variability in ocean conditions, and how predicted changes in the ocean from climate change will affect seabird populations in the future," Wolf said.</p><p>Wolf's research is supported in part by a grant from UCSC's STEPS Institute for Innovation in Environmental Research.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Wolf at (831) 459-4581 or wolf@biology.ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915144a28072704601a012ff43a1ed84"><name>1156</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Supernova Sage: Stan Woosley</title><summary>Stan Woosley, one of the world's leading theoretical astrophysicists, studies the evolution of massive stars--and their explosive demise.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>gamma-ray bursts, Stan Woosley, supernova, astronomy</keywords><description>Stan Woosley, one of the world's leading theoretical astrophysicists, studies the evolution of massive stars--and their explosive demise.</description><start-date>1176188400000</start-date><display-name>Supernova Sage: Stan Woosley...</display-name><path>/2007/04/1156</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/04/1156</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338276450</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338276450</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/04/images/woosley_stan.200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/04/images/woosley_stan.200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>woosley_stan.200.jpg</name><file-size>38523</file-size><width>200</width><height>263</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>UCSC astrophysicist Stan Woosley (Photo by Jim MacKenzie)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Given enough mass, a star can end its life in a glorious blaze of radiant energy. The death throes of massive stars are the most violent explosions in the universe -- supernovae that shine with the brilliance of 10 billion Suns and gamma-ray bursts that release a concentrated blast of intense radiation more powerful than a supernova.</p><p>Stan Woosley knows supernovae and gamma-ray bursts as well as anyone. A professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, he is one of the world's leading theoretical astrophysicists, with a long list of honors and achievements to his credit. But he remains focused on unresolved questions, saying no one really understands what happens when a star explodes. </p><p>	</p><p>Woosley leads a consortium of top scientists, including researchers at five universities and three national laboratories, using supercomputer simulations to study the evolution of massive stars and their explosion as supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. Funded by the U.S. Department of Energy with a five-year, $9.5 million grant, the Computational Astrophysics Consortium has access to some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world.</p><p>	</p><p>"Almost all of modern physics comes to bear in a supernova explosion, and we can put all that physics into a simulation. But you need powerful computers to do all the calculations involved," Woosley says.</p><p>	</p><p>The results of these investigations are crucial to scientists exploring fundamental questions about the nature of the universe. In recent years, for example, astronomers have used supernova observations to conclude that a mysterious "dark energy" permeates the universe and is pushing it to expand at an ever-faster pace. </p><p>	</p><p>These studies rely on a class of supernovae known as type Ia, which are used for cosmic distance measurements because their brightness evolves over time in a predictable manner. According to Woosley, however, it is not clear what accounts for the features that make them so useful. And that bothers him.</p><p>	</p><p>"Cosmologists have used these supernovae very productively, but it's all based on empirical observations. We would like to have a basic understanding of what causes this phenomenon so that we can make the distance determinations more accurate," he says. </p><p>	</p><p>On one level, type Ia supernovae are well understood as the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars. The explosion is triggered when the white dwarf siphons off enough mat-ter from a companion star to reach a critical mass (about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun). The mystery is what exactly takes place during the explosion. </p><p>	</p><p>A related category of cosmic explosions -- the type II supernovae -- presents theorists with another set of challenges. A type II supernova pops off somewhere in the universe about once a second. These explosions of massive stars (at least eight times the mass of the Sun) determine the compositions of galaxies, stars, and planets, stocking the universe with all the elements of the periodic table. This creation of the elements, called nucleosynthesis, is what got Woosley interested in supernovae in the first place. </p><p>	</p><p>Starting as a graduate student at Rice University in the 1960s, Woosley spent decades working with various collaborators to describe in exacting detail the origins of every naturally occurring element. Carbon, oxygen, iron, gold -- these elements and more are forged either in the nuclear furnaces of stars as they evolve or in the blaze of energy when they explode. </p><p>	</p><p>Supernova explosions spew the newly forged elements into space, where they drift in great clouds of gas and dust that eventually collapse to form new stars and planets. Star formation may even be triggered by the mixing effects of supernova blasts, Woosley says.</p><p>	</p><p>"They stir things up, they are bright and interesting in themselves, and they make the elements. But we still don't understand them in detail," he says. </p><p>	</p><p>While Woosley's decades of work on supernovae and nucleosynthesis established his reputation as a theoretical astrophysicist, he has gained further recognition in recent years for groundbreaking work on gamma-ray bursts.</p><p>	</p><p>For decades after their initial discovery by military satellites in the 1960s, gamma-ray bursts were one of astronomy's most baffling mysteries. By the 1990s, there were hundreds of competing theories about what causes these brief but powerful flashes of gamma radiation. Observations now support the "collapsar" model developed in 1998 by Woosley and his graduate student Andrew MacFadyen, now at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.</p><p>	</p><p>According to this model (which applies to "long-duration" bursts lasting more than two seconds) a gamma-ray burst accompanies the birth of a black hole from the collapse of a massive star. But many fundamental questions remain unanswered, Woosley says.</p><p>	</p><p>"With gamma-ray bursts, we're still just trying to figure out what's going on," he says. </p><p>	</p><p>In the new consortium, Woosley and his fellow theorists are teaming up with a large group of observational astronomers who are gathering new data on supernovae and gamma-ray bursts, and with computer scientists with expertise in writing code for the fastest supercomputers in the world. Comparing the results of theory-based simulations with real-world observations gives scientists a crucial "reality check" for their theories. </p><p>	</p><p>Simulations of exploding stars run on powerful supercomputers are beginning to capture the full complexity of the physical processes involved, Woosley says. "Those simulations make beautiful pictures that look more and more like nature because they are beginning to have the same complexity as nature."</p><p>______________________________________________________________________________</p><p><i>This article first appeared in the Spring 2007 issue of the</i> UCSC Review <i>magazine.</i></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9151462d8072704601a012ffa180b777"><name>1158</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>The Changing Face of the Humanities: A new dean, a new building, a new direction</title><summary>The humanities at UC Santa Cruz are poised to meet the challenges of a global future.</summary><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>humanities, Georges Van Den Abbeele, Humanities I Building, Brian Catlos, Terry Burke</keywords><description>The humanities at UC Santa Cruz are poised to meet the challenges of a global future.</description><start-date>1176188400000</start-date><display-name>The Changing Face of...</display-name><path>/2007/04/1158</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/04/1158</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338276859</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338276859</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/04/images/hum_courtyard.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/04/images/hum_courtyard.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hum_courtyard.300.jpg</name><file-size>75175</file-size><width>300</width><height>435</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Dean Georges Van Den Abbeele stops to talk to students in the Humanities courtyard. (Photo by Jim MacKenzie)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The new humanities building lies within a few feet of Founders Glen at Cowell College--where the campus first opened in 1965, with nearly half of the original faculty consisting of humanists. The significance of the location is not lost on newly appointed dean Georges Van Den Abbeele, who points out that the building reconnects the campus with a tradition in the humanities that is truly impressive, but often overlooked.</p><p>	</p><p>"This campus has long been at the forefront of interdisciplinary and collaborative research efforts in the humanities-in fact, UCSC has been a real model for humanities development around the nation," notes Van Den Abbeele. "In 1985, for example, this campus founded the first major research center specifically dedicated to humanistic inquiry, the Center for Cultural Studies. It served as a prototype for hundreds of humanities centers that have sprung up on other campuses. The very idea of a humanities research center was invented here."</p><p>	</p><p>Housing all faculty, departmental, and administrative offices for the division, the new six-story Humanities 1 Building has plenty to offer students. It sits within a $29.3 million complex that includes a 300-seat Humanities Lecture Hall, a landscaped courtyard with redwood benches, and a four-story adjacent structure that provides additional classroom space and computer labs for both the Humanities and Social Sciences Divisions. The new facilities now give the humanities a tangible presence on campus--not only centralizing its faculty, staff, and students, but also making events and programs more visible and accessible to other campus community members and the general public.</p><p>	</p><p>While humanities scholarship at UCSC and elsewhere is often overshadowed by high-profile research in science and technology, Van Den Abbeele notes that it is essential for modern society to understand scientific achievements from a human perspective. Humanities research, he strongly emphasizes, is more relevant than ever to how we view the world.</p><p>	</p><p>"Today--given our amazing success with technology and the high pace of development--there is a critical need to look at our involvement with technologies and the resulting societies that we are creating," Van Den Abbeele says. "As we are propelled into a world dominated by financial exigencies and technological development, it's an important necessity as a species to examine the written record and the cultural achievements of humanity."</p><p>	</p><p>The study of humanities, Van Den Abbeele contends, gives us the possibility of understanding how to live without fundamentalism, intolerance, and racism in highly advanced technological societies. While religion and spirituality have often become the response to cope with a changing world, he believes that the humanities can help us understand everything from extreme religious fundamentalism to new-age secularism. And he stresses that effective social policies are supported by basic humanities research. </p><p>	</p><p>"There's a tendency in American policies to foist the opinion that different cultures can't live together in places where there is civil strife--such as Yugoslavia, Rwanda, or Iraq," observes Van Den Abbeele. "People will say that Shiite and Sunni Muslims have been at war for hundreds of years, so they can never coexist peacefully. But that's just not true--and the study of history reveals that. At UCSC, we have humanities professors like Brian Catlos who are teaching courses and doing research on cultures in Spain where Muslims, Christians, and Jews have traditionally lived together peacefully for long periods of time in the past."</p><p>Van Den Abbeele's appointment as dean last July actually marked a return to his academic roots. Beginning his career at UCSC as a visiting assistant professor of literature in 1981, he spent five years on the Santa Cruz campus. His career path led him to a 15-year stint at UC Davis, where he was a professor of French and Italian, as well as director of the Davis Humanities Institute and the Pacific Regional Humanities Center. Since 1999, he has also served as president of the Western Humanities Alliance, a growing consortium of 23 West Coast universities--that was founded at UCSC. </p><p>	</p><p>In accepting UCSC's offer to return to the campus, Van Den Abbeele says he took note of how much the Humanities Division had developed in his absence, and considered how much more was possible. The division already has many areas of renown: Van Den Abbeele cites the Feminist Studies Department's exploration of women's issues around the globe, and the American Studies Department's worldwide focus on how American culture is perceived. </p><p>      </p><p>"World consciousness was an early idea here at UCSC, and the work currently being done in the various departments has become quite noteworthy," says Van Den Abbeele." Our History Department, for example, is a leader in developing the concept of 'world' history. Generally, U.S. history is taught as if it has nothing to do with the rest of the world. But professor and UC Presidential Chair Terry Burke and his graduate students have recently created a new model curriculum for teaching college-level courses in U.S. history that encompass an international perspective."</p><p>       </p><p>This is how the humanities will be taught in the 21st century--"preparing young people to be citizens in globalized cultures and economies," adds Van Den Abbeele.

Instead, they got so wrapped up in their senior design project they decided to stay at UCSC for a fifth year as undergraduates so they could see the project through to completion. By the end of this year, they hope to have their wireless sensor network deployed in Yellowstone National Park by the scientists who track one of the world's largest active volcanic systems.</p><p>Munday and Minolli led a team of six other students that won top honors in the Baskin School of Engineering's first Senior Design Project Contest in June 2006. Like many senior projects tackled by UCSC engineering students, theirs was proposed by an outside group that had a real-world problem in need of an engineering solution. In this case, the proposal came from Jacob Lowenstern, a research geologist for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Menlo Park, who oversees the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. </p><p>Yellowstone's world-famous geysers, hot springs, and other hydrothermal (hot water) features are fueled by heat released from a huge underground reservoir of molten rock. The observatory, created in 2001 by the USGS, Yellowstone National Park, and the University of Utah, tracks activity that could lead to hazardous seismic, hydrothermal, or volcanic events in the region.</p><p>Temperature measurements are an important part of the overall monitoring effort, but the observatory needs a more reliable and efficient system for gathering temperature data, Lowenstern says.</p><p>"Right now we use data loggers that sit there and gather data for weeks or months, and then someone has to go out into the field, download the data, and transfer it to a computer. Sometimes the instruments break, and they might even break a week into their deployment, in which case we wouldn't know until two months later when we go back and find we don't have any data," he says.</p><p>His challenge to the UCSC students was to come up with a wireless system that could monitor hundreds of sites throughout the park and feed temperature data back to a central computer at park headquarters. </p><p>Katia Obraczka, associate professor of computer engineering, advised the group of eight students who tackled the project. They also had help from several other faculty, including lecturer Stephen Petersen and associate professor of computer engineering Roberto Manduchi. </p><p>After brainstorming and coming up with a plan, the students organized themselves into two groups: Minolli led a group working on the wireless communication system, while Munday's group focused on the digital controller for handling data from the temperature sensors. The other UCSC students involved in the project were Tim Jones, Khi Lam, Paul Schooss, Tony Hutter, Jason Rhodewalt, and Yiping Chen.</p><p>Their system, designed to send temperature data back to the base station once a day, also allows scientists to log on via the Internet and ask for data from any site at any time. The system also informs researchers of any problems that crop up in the field units. But what makes the system unique is its ability to operate within the constraints of the national park setting.</p><p>"Yellowstone is under a lot of pressure to minimize environmental and aesthetic impacts, so relay stations, solar panels, and big antennas are really frowned upon," Lowenstern said.</p><p>The monitoring units in the field had to be unobtrusive and use very little power to prolong battery life, while providing long-range radio transmissions. The units also had to operate over a temperature range from boiling hot to well below freezing. And, of course, the system couldn't be too costly.</p><p>"A lot of effort went into micromanaging the system so it would use as little power as possible and still meet the specifications," Minolli says.</p><p>The system uses a sophisticated networking protocol, thanks to Obraczka's expertise in wireless networking. Transmissions from a unit that is out of range of the base station can be relayed by other units. The base station monitors battery power in all the units and dynamically reconfigures the network to minimize the load on units that are low on power.</p><p>"In June, we had the digital controller finished but we were still working on the long-range radio module, so we used an off-the-shelf radio system that had shorter range but allowed us to demonstrate the networking protocol and show that it works," Munday says. </p><p>Lowenstern was sufficiently impressed to provide additional funding so the students could continue their work. Three students--Munday, Minolli, and Rhodewalt--worked on the project over the summer under a USGS contract. Minolli and Munday are now continuing their work as an independent-study project. </p><p>"I not only felt that we had a responsibility to see this through, but I also really liked doing it," Minolli said. "I plan to study wireless communications in graduate school, and I figured the best way to prepare is to keep working on this project."</p><p>"I've been impressed by how dedicated these students are at trying to come up with something that meets our needs," Lowenstern says. "They faced significant technical obstacles that they've been working through with a lot of enthusiasm."</p><p>Yellowstone National Park will ultimately decide whether the students' system gets deployed. But Lowenstern says the park geologist has been very enthusiastic about the project, which bodes well for its being accepted by the park.</p><p>And if that falls through for some reason, Munday says the design is flexible enough for use in a wide range of other applications.</p><p>"We've already had inquiries from other potential clients," he says. "It's a unique and versatile system that you can connect to any kind of sensor and could use in a variety of industries."</p><p>___________________________________________________________________________</p><p><i>This article first appeared in the Spring 2007 issue of the</i> UCSC Review <i>magazine.</i></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91514ce48072704601a012ffd6317d92"><name>1167</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Seismologists discover complex structure in Tonga mantle wedge</title><summary>The subduction zones where oceanic plates sink beneath the continents produce volcanic arcs such as those that make up the "rim of fire" around the Pacific Ocean.

The volcanoes are fed by molten rock rising within a wedge of the Earth's mantle above the subducting plate. Although geologists have a pretty good picture of the processes that produce volcanic arcs, a new study finds that the structure of the mantle wedge may be far more complex than anyone had imagined.</p><p>"Geology textbooks show simple cartoons of the processes happening in these mantle wedges--a sinking slab and some melting that comes up in volcanoes--but our results suggest that those cartoons are grossly inadequate," said Thorne Lay, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p><p>Lay is a coauthor of a paper describing the new findings published this week in the Online Early Edition of the journal <i>Science.</i> The first author of the paper is Yingcai Zheng, a UCSC graduate student working with Lay, and the other coauthors are Megan Flanagan of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Quentin Williams, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC.</p><p>The researchers used a seismic imaging technique (reflection seismology) to detect layered structures within the mantle wedge of the Tonga subduction zone in the southwestern Pacific. Analyzing data from deep earthquakes that occurred beneath the subduction zone, they looked for seismic waves that traveled upward into the mantle wedge, reflected from the underside of layers within the mantle, and were recorded by seismic sensors in distant locations. </p><p>"We were stunned to find many reflecting boundaries in the mantle wedge above the sinking slab, and these are laterally extensive throughout the wedge region," Lay said. "This is surprising because the textbook version of mantle wedges suggests that there would be little structure."</p><p>The researchers attributed these unexpected features to the effects of water and other materials that are squeezed out of the subducting slab and rise up through the mantle wedge. When water is added to hot mantle rock, one of the main effects is to lower the melting temperature of the rocks. The resulting pockets of molten rock rise up through the mantle and feed volcanoes at the surface.</p><p>"That all happens in the upper 100 kilometers or so and has been well understood for at least a couple of decades. But we're seeing structure much deeper down, at depths as much as 450 kilometers," Lay said. "We think the fluids don't come out all at once, but are released progressively as the pressure increases with depth and then have to percolate up through the overlying wedge."</p><p>Whereas the added water causes mantle rock to melt in the upper layers, the researchers said different effects are likely to occur at greater depths. Under the intense pressures found at depth, added fluids would cause changes in the composition of the mantle rock, and structures composed of these altered minerals within the mantle wedge would be detectable by their altered seismic reflectivity. The detection of layered structures was attributed to the mantle wedge being progressively flushed with fluids expelled from the sinking slab, producing not only melts that rise in volcanoes but also mineralogical structures with seismic reflectivity.</p><p>"This has many implications for how volcanic arcs evolve and how they produce the thick piles of remelted rocks that eventually add to the continents," Lay said.</p><p>Zheng noted that some of the reflecting structures he detected extend far to the west, away from the trench where the subducting slab currently dives down beneath the overriding plate.</p><p>"If those reflectors to the west were created in the subduction process by infiltration of fluids from the slab, they might represent the historical past of the Tonga subduction zone," Zheng said.</p><p>The study used methods similar to those used in oil exploration, in which sensors record reflections of seismic waves from explosions or vibrations with shallow manmade sources at or near the surface. To study the mantle wedge, the researchers essentially turned this approach upside down, using deep earthquakes as the energy sources and looking for reflections of seismic waves traveling up through the wedge. The Tonga subduction zone is a good place to use this technique because of the frequency of deep earthquakes in this dynamic region.</p><p>"An earthquake is like a flash of lightning in the dark Earth interior. We used multiple earthquakes of different mechanisms, each illuminating in a different angle, to achieve a clear three-dimensional picture of the mantle structures," Zheng said.</p><p>The study was only possible, however, because of the extensive network of seismic instruments that have been installed around the world. In North America, the National Science Foundation (NSF) EarthScope project has been deploying an extensive array of modern digital seismic stations, and similar efforts around the world are linked to create a global seismic network. Seismic data from this network were obtained for the study from the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) Data Management Center. The study was funded by NSF grants and a mini-grant from the UC Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Thorne Lay at thorne@pmc.ucsc.edu and Yingcai Zheng at yzheng@pmc.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91514f828072704601a012ff58fa94bf"><name>1171</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A Legacy of Success: Two pioneering UC Santa Cruz programs prepare minority students for careers in science</title><summary>The Minority Biomedical Research Support (MBRS) and the Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) programs are two closely coordinated initiatives designed to ensure that more minorities are prepared to lead in the nation's science labs and classrooms.</summary><author>Louise Gilmore Donahue, (831) 459-5312, ldonahue@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>MBRS, Minority  Biomedical Research Support, MARC, Minority Access to Research Careers, biomedical research</keywords><description>The Minority Biomedical Research Support (MBRS) and the Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) programs are two closely coordinated initiatives designed to ensure that more minorities are prepared to lead in the nation's science labs and classrooms.</description><start-date>1176188400000</start-date><display-name>A Legacy of Success:...</display-name><path>/2007/04/1171</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/04/1171</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338279247</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338279247</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Louise Donahue</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-5312</phone><email>ldonahue@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/04/images/marc_mbrs.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/04/images/marc_mbrs.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>marc_mbrs.300.jpg</name><file-size>66483</file-size><width>300</width><height>228</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Graduate student Brent Rubio (right) shows undergraduates (l-r) Christine Sinclair, Deborah Ortiz, Yonathan Essaw, and program assistant Yulianna Ortega his work in the Marine Natural Products Lab of Phillip Crews.

Rubio, who describes his ethnicity as a "mixed plate"--Filipino, Hawaiian, Spanish, and Chinese--wants to return to Hawaii to teach chemistry. "Seeing a professor who is also a minority really inspires students like me."</p><p>Rubio has found his niche at UCSC in the Minority Biomedical Research Support (MBRS) program. MBRS and Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) are two closely coordinated initiatives designed to ensure that more minorities are prepared to lead in the nation's science labs and classrooms. MARC is an honors program for undergraduates, while the MBRS program includes both undergraduates and graduate students. </p><p>The long-standing programs offer a combination of intensive lab work, faculty mentoring, staff support, and financial assistance. The programs' coordinator Malika Moutawakkil Bell, who earned undergraduate and master's degrees in chemistry from UCSC, knows firsthand that being a minority in higher education can be intimidating. "I think having a place to belong and having these cheerleaders rooting you on is invaluable," says Bell. "These students don't grow up having a cousin who has a Ph.D., so this is a big step for them."</p><p>"It's like a family," adds MARC director Alan Zahler. "We keep students from falling through the cracks."</p><p>Funded mainly by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with support from UCSC, the year-round programs begin with eight-week summer workshops in laboratory research. Dozens of faculty in molecular, cell, and developmental biology, chemistry and biochemistry, environmental toxicology, and ecology and evolutionary biology provide crucial training for the students in their labs. NIH programs vary around the country, but at UCSC the focus is on encouraging students to pursue biomedical research. </p><p>"We create a community of scientists and give them access to cutting-edge research," says Zahler, a professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology. "Once they experience that, they can take the ball and run with it." </p><p>To maximize lab time and minimize distractions from outside jobs, MARC students receive stipends, and MBRS students are paid hourly for working in the labs; students also get help with UCSC fees. "The money is important, but the really important part is the access to the research labs," said MBRS director Barry Bowman, a professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology. </p><p>Both programs have benefited from remarkable continuity. Leo Ortiz, now a professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology, and former faculty member Victor Rocha cofounded the MARC program about 30 years ago, and Ortiz handed it off to Zahler only a year and a half ago. Bowman himself has been with the MBRS program almost from the beginning, and Bell's predecessor as the coordinator for both programs, Bernice Frankl, guided students from 1991 until her retirement in the fall of 2006. </p><p>While the students' research in both programs is as varied as their backgrounds, a common thread is their heightened sense of responsibility to give back.</p><p>For chemistry senior Deborah Ortiz, it's the fight against cancer. Ortiz balances two concurrent nanoparticle research projects, both with potential applications against cancer. "That's really close to my heart because my mother died of cancer" in 2006, Ortiz says. Of African American and Colombian descent, she followed her mother's advice to remain in school during her mother's ordeal and plans a chemistry career in cancer and lymphoma research.</p><p>MBRS neuroscience senior Yonathan Essaw is on the trail of the Wolbachia bacteria, which researchers hope to utilize in fighting malaria. The youth who knew only a few words of English when he arrived in the United States from Ethiopia at age 13 is now passionate about research. "You can see things happening. There's always something new to discover," he noted. Essaw hasn't decided between medical school and research, but wants to return to his native Ethiopia. "I want to help my people."</p><p>Moving to the next level seems to come naturally to these students. "About 45 percent of our fellows go on to get graduate degrees--one of the best rates in the country," says Zahler.</p><p>"We taught each other in a supportive and nonthreatening environment which was very different from that of my other science peers," recalled alumnus Cameron Bess, a graduate fellow in cellular biophysics at Rockefeller University in New York.</p><p>"As a minority, it was important to see that my scientific community was no different than I was, that I was not forfeiting my heritage by studying molecular biology or biochemistry," says another alumnus, Oliver Fregoso, a third-year graduate student at the Watson Schoool of Biological Sciences at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Cold Spring Harbor, New York. "We had a lot of fun together as a group-we helped each other in classes, we worked hard together, we joked together. We were just always there for each other."</p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p><p><i>This article first appeared in the Spring 2007 issue of the</i> UCSC Review <i>magazine.</i></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9151540c8072704601a012ff21891be5"><name>1177</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Arboretum holds annual Spring Plant Sale on Saturday, April 21</title><summary>The UCSC Arboretum will hold its annual Spring Plant Sale on Saturday, April 21, from 12 noon to 4 p.m.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495, stephens@ucsc.edu; Stephen McCabe (831) 427-2998, smccabe@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Arboretum</keywords><description>The UCSC Arboretum will hold its annual Spring Plant Sale on Saturday, April 21, from 12 noon to 4 p.m.</description><start-date>1176188400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Arboretum holds annual...</display-name><path>/2007/04/1177</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/04/1177</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338280405</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338280405</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/04/images/ruby_slippers.72.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/04/images/ruby_slippers.72.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ruby_slippers.72.jpg</name><file-size>52713</file-size><width>200</width><height>139</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Mimulus "Ruby Slippers"

Why did they serve? What is their experience?</p>
<p>Those questions are the inspiration for "Personal Perspectives of the Iraq War and Past Wars," a series of film screenings and talks by award-winning filmmakers and authors that will take place at UC Santa Cruz, May 2-24.</p>
<p><em>Time</em> magazine senior correspondent Michael Weisskopf, an embedded journalist on assignment in Iraq in 2003-who lost an arm when he threw an incoming grenade out of a Humvee, saving the lives of the soldiers he was writing about-will be the featured speaker on May 24 at Merrill College. The only reporter ever allowed to be in recovery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center's Ward 57 (which is reserved for military casualties), Weisskopf is the author of <em>Blood Brothers: Among the Soldiers of Ward 57.</em> He was featured on the cover of <em>Time</em> in October of 2006 and has recently appeared several times on National Public Radio to discuss the issue of substandard conditions for veterans and amputees at Walter Reed.</p>
<p>Ian Olds, a UCSC alumnus who graduated in 1998, will return to the campus on May 2 to kick off the series--and screen his award-winning documentary film, <em>Occupation: Dreamland,</em> a behind-the-scenes look at the embattled Iraqi city of Fallujah in the winter of 2004. Olds's film was honored with a 2006 Independent Spirit Award, and the former film student will host a discussion after the screening.</p>
<p>Charlie Trujillo, the award-winning author of <em>Soldados: Chicanos in Viet Nam</em> and the novel <em>Dogs From Illusion</em> will also come to UCSC on May 4 to talk about his war experience. Trujillo served in Vietnam as an infantry sergeant and was awarded the Purple Heart and a Bronze Star medal.</p>
<p>The May series--scheduled during the month of the Memorial Day holiday--includes five additional film screenings, including <em>The War Tapes</em> (2006) an acclaimed documentary filmed by soldiers themselves in Iraq; <em>The Tuskegee Airmen: They Fought Two Wars</em> (2003), about black pilots during World War II; <em>Frontline: A Company of Soldiers</em> (2005) filmed by an embedded production team following a small unit in Baghdad; <em>Beyond the Barbed Wire</em> (1997), the story of Japanese Americans who served in WWII while many of their families were held in internment camps; and <em>The Navajo Code Talkers</em> (1996), about Navajo marines who created the only unbroken code in modern military history through the use of their ancient language.</p>
<p>"The series offers a look at war from the perspective of people who have been there--journalists, soldiers, civilians--it's a good mix," said Dennis Tibbetts, director of UCSC's American Indian Resource Center, who is coordinating the series.</p>
<p>Tibbetts was drafted in 1966 and saw combat himself the following year as a marine in Vietnam near Dong Ha. He noted that Native Americans have a long history of serving in the military and that this got him thinking about who actually ends up serving in the armed forces. He decided to put together a series of film screenings focusing on those who had served in different wars--from World War II to Vietnam to Iraq--and to personally invite notable speakers to share their reflections on what they saw and experienced.</p>
<p>"Each ethnic group and race has a different story on how war affects them," Tibbetts observed. "Japanese Americans were interned during World War II, but they also died in very high numbers just to prove their loyalty to the United States. In Vietnam, Native Americans served at a very high rate--at nearly 25 percent of their age group male population. In Iraq, it seems to be more about class than racial or ethnic groups. But I don't think people really have a sense of who's paying the price, who's dying in this war today," he added.</p>
<p>Tibbetts plans on leading discussions following several of the film screenings. He noted that there are very few veterans at UCSC, and he hopes the series will help students gain knowledge about who serves in the armed forces, what the actual combat experience is like, and particularly, what happens afterward when soldiers come home.</p>
<p>"It's an all-volunteer army and many people are personally untouched by the Iraq war, but there are going to be a lot of veterans coming back who are very damaged," Tibbetts observed. He noted that the survival rate for people wounded in Iraq is nearly double compared to Vietnam, because it's an urban war with better technology, Humvees, and body armor.</p>
<p>"In Vietnam, people often bled to death before they got help," Tibbetts said. "In Iraq, more people are now surviving, but also losing arms, legs, and eyes, or suffering brain damage. As (<em>Time</em> correspondent) Weisskopf points out in his book, there's been a horrific lack of planning for amputees, as well as for the long-term costs of rotating guys though Iraq two or three times."</p>
<p>"Most of these soldiers have a sense of pride in being in the military, of volunteering to defend their country," Tibbetts added. "But these documentary films show that it's very obvious early on after Saddam is overthrown that there is no strategy for the aftermath. It's very much like Vietnam, where you knew as soon as you landed, it was just about trying to stay alive, not about establishing a democracy. I recognized that immediately in these films."</p>

UCSC professor emeritus of English literature Michael Warren will moderate, setting the scene for each performer. Free birthday cake will be available after the performances.</p><p>For more information about these events, contact Dana Werdmuller at Shakespeare Santa Cruz: (831) 459-3160, <a href="mailto:dwerdmul@ucsc.edu">dwerdmul@ucsc.edu</a>, or go to <a href="http://www.shakespearesantacruz.org.">www.shakespearesantacruz.org.</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9151634f8072704601a012ffae2f48da"><name>1192</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Detailed campus water use study begins this week</title><author>Guy Lasnier, (831) 459-5312, lasnier@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>water, plumbing, students</keywords><start-date>1176706800000</start-date><display-name>Detailed campus water use...</display-name><path>/2007/04/1192</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/04/1192</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338284321</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1304098793325</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2955</phone><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Beginning this week, teams of students will begin counting plumbing fixtures across campus as part of a detailed study of water use.</p>
<p>The students, working in pairs, will venture into buildings to survey existing fixtures. They will count toilets, faucets, showers, dishwashers, ice machines, washing machines, and kitchen spray valves - anything that uses water - noting whether they are older fixtures or newer, more efficient models.</p>
<p>The study's goals are to:</p>
<p>. Help create a more sustainable campus environment by reducing water usage in existing facilities and new construction.</p>
<p>. Lessen the need for new water supply in the City of Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>. Compile data on fixtures into a campus system so all can benefit from detailed building fixture information.</p>
<p>. Increase campus awareness of ways to increase water efficiency.</p>
<p>The study will result in a report expected in September that will:</p>
<p>. Identify improvements that could be made to campus facilities and operations to reduce water consumption.</p>
<p>. Analyze the cost-effectiveness of potential improvements.</p>
<p>. Recommend top priority measures to be carried out within the next five years, and lower priority measures that may be implemented in subsequent years.</p>
<p>UCSC has hired Maddaus Water Management, an Alamo, Calif., consulting firm that specializes in water conservation and management, to conduct the survey and prepare the report.</p>
<p>Most of the data will be collected by a team of 11 students who will measure faucet and shower flow rates, time toilet flushes, look for leaks, and check for missing faucet aerators. The students will also survey campus irrigation systems.</p>
<p>During the summer, Maddaus Water Management will conduct additional surveys of water used in labs, greenhouses, cooling towers, and other facilities. The consultants will then evaluate the data, develop a list of improvements the campus could make to reduce water consumption, and rank the potential improvements according to cost effectiveness.</p>

The awards were announced on April 13 by Dr. John Dirks, president and scientific director of the Gairdner Foundation. </p><p>"The 2007 awards reflect the importance of basic discoveries that lead to a better understanding of human disease and the development of treatments and cures to alleviate them," Dirks said.</p><p>Noller, who directs the Center for Molecular Biology of RNA at UCSC, and Thomas Steitz of Yale University were recognized for their identification of the detailed structure and function of the ribosome, a complex molecular machine that carries out protein synthesis in all living cells. Their citation reads, "For their studies on the structure and function of the ribosome which showed that the peptidyl transferase was an RNA catalyzed reaction, and for revealing the mechanism of inhibition of this function by antibiotics."</p><p>The other awardees include Dr. Dennis Slamon of UCLA for his work on the breast cancer drug Herceptin; C. David Allis of Rockefeller University for his discovery of the universal mechanisms whereby modifications in specialized proteins called histones affect genome stability and gene transcription; and Kim Nasmyth of Oxford University for a series of discoveries pinpointing the novel mechanisms in cell division that are essential to life.</p><p>The Gairdner Awards, founded by the late Toronto businessman James Gairdner, are now in their 48th year. They have grown to be one of the most prestigious international awards for medical research, recognizing outstanding contributions by medical scientists worldwide whose work will significantly improve the quality of life.</p><p> </p><p>Each Gairdner awardee receives $30,000 and a statue (Le Coeur) at a gala dinner that will be held this year on October 25 at the Four Seasons Hotel in Toronto. The awardees are chosen through a rigorous two-stage process by two medical advisory committees made up of leading medical scientists from Canada and around the world. Since 2003, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) has been the lead national sponsor of the Gairdner Awards. </p><p>Noller has received numerous awards and honors for his work, and his laboratory continues to make major advances in understanding how ribosomes work (see <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=940">earlier story</a>). He earned his bachelor's degree in biochemistry at UC Berkeley and his Ph.D. in chemistry at the University of Oregon. Before joining the UCSC faculty in 1968, Noller held postdoctoral positions at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, and the Institute of Molecular Biology at the University of Geneva, Switzerland. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1992.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915167e18072704601a012ffffc76976"><name>1200</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Tragedy at Virginia Tech University</title><start-date>1176793200000</start-date><display-name>Tragedy at Virginia Tech...</display-name><path>/2007/04/1200</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/04/1200</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338285468</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338285468</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In the wake of yesterday's tragedy at Virginia Tech University, UC President Robert Dynes has issued the following statement, expressing the extreme disbelief and profound sorrow that all members of our University of California community share.

Friedland may be best known for his critique of mechanized tomato harvesting, but he's been a thorn in the side of corporate agriculture for almost half a century.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions as a scholar and researcher, Friedland, a professor emeritus and research professor of community studies and sociology at UC Santa Cruz, will receive the inaugural Distinguished Social Sciences Emeriti Faculty Award at a luncheon in his honor on April 27.</p><p>"This award recognizes the valuable contributions of our emeriti faculty," said Social Sciences Dean Sheldon Kamieniecki, who initiated the award. "The success of the Division of Social Sciences is due, in part, to the foundation laid by the faculty who have built our departments and brought distinction to our division."</p><p>Friedland, who retired from teaching in 1991, was chosen by a committee of current and emeriti faculty members and students from the Social Sciences Division, who evaluated nominations submitted by faculty, staff, and alumni. </p><p>Friedland came to UCSC in 1969 as founding chair of community studies. His wide-ranging interest in agriculture focused on people, including the impacts of technology on growers and farmworkers, and he called on UC to be responsive to the social consequences of UC agricultural research and not just economic efficiency. As power was being concentrated in global agricultural corporations, he cast a skeptical eye on the notion that bigger was better. </p><p>Friedland's landmark study of mechanized tomato harvesting documented the sharp decline in the number of workers and growers, the doubling of tomato acreage in California, and the displacement of production from the Stockton area to the southern San Joaquin Valley. A subsequent predictive study of the mechanization of lettuce established Friedland as the leading researcher in the sociology of agriculture.  </p><p>An outspoken critic of what he considered UC's narrow research agenda, Friedland saluted the university as a "remarkable place" when he received a lifetime achievement award from the Rural Sociological Society in 2005. "Intellectually, I found a kind of freedom that proves that academic freedom is a serious thing," he said.</p><p>#####</p><p><i>Editor's Note</i>: The award luncheon is not open to the public; journalists who plan to cover the event are asked to contact Andrea Cohen in the Social Sciences Dean's Office at acohen@ucsc.edu or (831) 459-3212.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91516ade8072704601a012ff2cffeaeb"><name>1202</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Resources for those affected by the Virginia Tech tragedy</title><start-date>1176879600000</start-date><display-name>Resources for those affected...</display-name><path>/2007/04/1202</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/04/1202</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338286239</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338286239</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS) is reaching out with compassion to the many individuals who have been affected in the aftermath of the tragedy at Virginia Tech University.  Violence, the threat of violence, and traumatic death are daily facts of life, but we often distance ourselves emotionally from these realities.  In the aftermath of the Virginia Tech events, all of us who live, work, or have loved ones on college campuses are responding with varying degrees of shock, fear, grief, numbness, confusion, anger,and mourning.</p><p>Sudden violent and traumatic events that hit close to home can stir unresolved feelings from previous trauma, undermine one's sense of safety, create feelings of intense vulnerability, and affect one's mood, sleep, academics or relationships.  Whether you have suffered the direct loss of a loved one, are a survivor of violence yourself, or are feeling overwhelmed by the impact of the Virginia Tech assaults and suicide, CPS is available to assist you.</p><p>We are providing two upcoming opportunities for campus community members to gather together, discuss the personal impact of Virginia Tech events, listen and support each other, and receive information about trauma and recovery.</p><p>The meetings will be:</p><p>* Thursday, April 19, at 12:00-1:00 </p><p>* Monday, April 23, at 12:00-1:00</p><p>They will both take place in the Amah Mutsun Conference Room A on the 3rd floor of the Bay Tree Bookstore</p><p>Please check our web site for additional information and online resources for grief and trauma recovery: <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/counsel">http://www2.ucsc.edu/counsel</a></p><p>In addition, all registered students are eligible for our services, which include:</p><p>* walk-in crisis appointments, weekdays, 9:30-11:30 a.m. and 2-4 p.m.</p><p>* brief confidential individual counseling. For more information, call 459-2628.</p><p>UCSC staff and faculty can access their Employee Assistance Program by dialing: 1-866-808-6205.</p><p>Counseling and Psychological Services staff looks forward to assisting you, however we can, in the days and weeks ahead.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>Campus Community</audience><admin>Counseling and Psychological Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91516e4a8072704601a012ffccebc89c"><name>1204</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC engineer Claire Gu honored by International Society for Optical Engineering</title><summary>Claire Gu, professor of electrical engineering at UCSC, has been elected a Fellow of the International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE). </summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Claire Gu</keywords><description>Claire Gu, professor of electrical engineering at UCSC, has been elected a Fellow of the International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE). </description><start-date>1176879600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC engineer Claire Gu...</display-name><path>/2007/04/1204</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/04/1204</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338287127</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338287127</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/04/images/gu.crop.72.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/04/images/gu.crop.72.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gu.crop.72.jpg</name><file-size>52627</file-size><width>150</width><height>184</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Claire Gu</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Claire Gu, professor of electrical engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has been elected a Fellow of the International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE).

Wilmers, an assistant professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p><p>Favorable environmental conditions that produce abundant supplies of food and stimulate population booms appear to set the stage for population crashes that occur when several "good years" in a row are followed by a bad year. "It's almost paradoxical, because you'd think a large population would be better off, but it turns out they're more vulnerable to a drop in resources," says Wilmers. </p><p>Understanding how environmental changes influence fluctuations in animal populations is crucial to predicting and mitigating the influence of global climate change. In a paper entitled "A Perfect Storm: The Combined Effects on Population Fluctuations of Auto-Correlated Environmental Noise, Age Structure, and Density Dependence," that appears in the May issue of <i>The American Naturalist</i>, Wilmers describes a powerful new mathematical model that evaluates how climate and resources interact with populations, including a fine-grained analysis of impacts on juveniles, reproducing adults, and adults. </p><p>In areas where climate change leads to more "good years," with the occasional poor year still occurring, populations will fluctuate dramatically and be more prone to extinction as a result, said Wilmers. Highly prolific species will be particularly vulnerable to such fluctuations because their populations will build up most rapidly, noted Wilmers, a vertebrate conservation ecologist. Dramatic population fluctuations make species more vulnerable to extinction due to disease, inbreeding, and other causes; in addition, each crash reduces the genetic diversity of a species, lowering its ability to adapt and making it more prone to extinction.</p><p>Results similar to those predicted by Wilmers's model occurred among reindeer on St. Matthew Island in the Bering Sea, where the population grew from 29 animals in 1944 to 6,000 in 1960, when a return of harsh climatic conditions caused the population to crash to about 40 animals. </p><p>Similarly, on Isle Royale, where the moose and wolf populations have been monitored since 1959, the moose population increased nearly 250 percent from 1980 to 1995 (after the wolf was decimated by disease). That boom occurred during a positive phase of climate conditions on the island that ended in 1996, when unfavorable conditions caused the moose population to crash. </p><p>"An unusually long sequence of good years allows a population to grow to such high densities that when a bad year comes along, the population is wiped out among all age groups, from juveniles to adults," said Wilmers. Moose, caribou, reindeer, and other hoofed species are most likely to be influenced by such changes because they live at northern latitudes where climate change effects are strongest, he noted. Similarly, herbivores are more likely to suffer than predators because their food supply responds more quickly to changes in the environment.</p><p>"If global warming leads to more good years, and longer strings of good years in a row that are interrupted by the occasional bad year, we're going to see more of these violent fluctuations," he said. </p><p>#####</p><p>Note to Journalists: Wilmers may be reached at cwilmers@ucsc.edu</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915172ab8072704601a012ff9374705a"><name>1207</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Two UC Santa Cruz humanities professors awarded Guggenheim Fellowships</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1176966000000</start-date><display-name>Two UC Santa Cruz...</display-name><path>/2007/04/1207</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/04/1207</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338288242</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338288242</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value><value>History of Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/04/images/hershatter_gail.180.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/04/images/hershatter_gail.180.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hershatter_gail.180.jpg</name><file-size>34555</file-size><width>180</width><height>273</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Gail Hershatter</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/04/images/clifford_james.180.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/04/images/clifford_james.180.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>clifford_james.180.jpg</name><file-size>47128</file-size><width>180</width><height>240</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>James Clifford</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Two UC Santa Cruz humanities professors have been selected to receive 2007 Guggenheim Fellowship awards. </p><p>History professor Gail Hershatter and history of consciousness professor James Clifford were among the 189 artists, scholars, and scientists selected this year from 2,800 applicants for awards totaling $7,600,000.</p><p>Guggenheim Fellows are appointed on the basis of distinguished achievement in the past and exceptional promise for future accomplishment. The program considers applications in 78 different fields, ranging from the natural sciences to the creative arts. </p><p>Hershatter has been director of UCSC's Institute for Humanities Research since 2002 and codirector of the Center for Cultural Studies for the past 11 years. An expert on Chinese history, her research since 1996 has centered on the investigation of rural Chinese women during the period of early socialism. She will use the fellowship, in conjunction with an award from the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, to write a book based on this research entitled "The Gender of Memory: Rural Women and China's Collective Past."</p><p>Hershatter's previous book credits include <i>Dangerous Pleasures: Prostitution and Modernity in Twentieth-Century Shanghai</i> (1997), which received the 1997 Joan Kelly Memorial Prize in Women's History of the American Historical Association. She is also the author of <i>Women in China's Long Twentieth Century</i> (University of California Press, 2007), and coeditor of <i>A Guide to Women's Studies in China</i> (Berkeley: Institute of East Asian Studies, 1999). </p><p>Clifford was the founding director of UCSC's Center for Cultural Studies. He is best known for his historical and literary critiques of anthropological practice, travel literature, and cultural performances. The Guggenheim Fellowship will enable him to take a full year sabbatical to finish writing a book on "Indigenous Cultural Politics" that he has been researching for nearly a decade. The book will contain detailed case studies from California, Melanesia, and Alaska as Clifford examines what it means to be "rooted" in a world where everything seems to be in motion. </p><p>Clifford's new book will complete a trilogy-the widely influential first volume <i>The Predicament of Culture</i> (Harvard University Press, 1988) wove together his essays on 20th-century ethnography, literature, and art, and has been translated into seven languages; and the second, <i>Routes: Travel and Translation in the Late 20th Century</i> (Harvard University Press, 1997) explored issues of dwelling and travel in anthropology, travel, tourism, and a range of cultural performances. </p><p>Both Hershatter and Clifford were honored in 2004 as two of the first recipients of the UC Santa Cruz Humanities Distinguished Professor Award for outstanding research achievement.</p><p>                                         </p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915174188072704601a012ffb0d65b3f"><name>1208</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Varieties galore at this year's UC Santa Cruz Farm Spring Plant Sale May 5-6</title><summary>Just as gourmets appreciate fine wine, gardeners in Santa Cruz seek out unusual varieties of flowers, vegetables, and herbs.

At this year's UC Santa Cruz Spring Plant Sale, gardeners will delight in the array of varieties available, including 12 varieties of sunflowers, at least 18 tomato varieties, a dozen peppers, three strawberries, and several raspberries.</p>
<p>The sale takes place May 5-6 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the Barn Theater parking lot at the base of campus, where plenty of free parking is available. Members of the Friends of the Farm &amp; Garden will be admitted at 9 a.m. on Saturday and receive a 10 percent discount on purchases; memberships will be available during the sale. Only cash and check are accepted. All proceeds support the UCSC Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture.</p>
<p>The range of varieties available this year pays homage to Alan Chadwick, who founded the original UCSC garden in 1967 and was a major force in building gardeners' appreciation of plant varieties.</p>
<p>The sale will spotlight a new collection of dazzling blue- and purple-flowering plants that will sparkle in perennial beds and herb gardens, including lavenders, salvias, iris, three different butterfly bushes, herbs, and bedding plants.</p>
<p>As always, a full selection of organically grown plants will be available, including a rainbow of flowers: cosmos, zinnias, statice, snapdragons, stock, coneflowers, and more. Vegetables will include tomatillos, Asian greens, cucumbers, summer and winter squash, carving pumpkins and gourds, leeks, scallions, Swiss chard, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, lettuce, and salad mix. Herbs such as cilantro, dill, and many basil varieties will also be for sale.</p>
<p>"We'll have all the old favorites, but we're excited about this new 'true blue' collection, which marks the beginning of a new Farm &amp; Garden collection that will grow over time," said Christof Bernau, manager of the Farm's garden, who has propagated many of the plants that will be for sale. "These species all prefer well-drained soil and full sun, although many tolerate partial shade. As an added plus, most are deer resistant."</p>
<p>Among the highlights of the "blue collection":</p>
<p>. <em>Provence</em>, a common lavender beloved for its fragrance.</p>
<p>. <em>Silver Frost</em>, another lavender that provides striking contrast in the garden.</p>
<p>. Salvias with blooms that range from true-blue to deep-purple and habits from low-growing spreaders to shrubs.</p>
<p>. Butterfly bushes adored by hummingbirds, including <em>Buddleia lindleyana</em>, which grows 10-12 feet tall with lavender-magenta flowers, and two different cultivars that produce spikes of fragrant soft lavender-blue blooms.</p>
<p>. Blue-flowering annuals include bachelor's button, honeywort, love-in-a-mist, blue flax, starflower, and a noninvasive species of forget-me-not.</p>
<p>The Spring Plant Sale is cosponsored by the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems and the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden. More information is available by calling (831) 459-3240 or visiting <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu">casfs.ucsc.edu</a>.</p>

<p>The EPA tracked green power purchasing among collegiate athletic conferences through its College &amp; University Green Power Challenge, which concluded recently with 33 schools and 16 conferences participating nationwide. EPA's Green Power Partnership encourages organizations to purchase green power as a way to reduce the environmental impacts associated with conventional electricity use.</p>
<p>The 2006-07 honor is the second for the campus this year from the EPA. In January, the EPA named UC Santa Cruz its sixth largest green power purchaser in the country. The list was based on purchases through Dec. 31.</p>
<p>In announcing the initial honor, the EPA noted that UCSC students had voted to increase their own student fees to enhance campus support for "green power." Tapping the student-generated fund, the campus purchased 50 million kilowatt hours of clean energy in the form of renewable energy certificates. Because of the purchase, on top of UC Santa Cruz's already existing electrical contract for 5 million kilowatt hours of renewable power, the campus is now considered 100 percent green--offsetting all its projected electrical consumption for fiscal 2006-07. (See UC Santa Cruz <em>Currents</em> <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1043">story</a>.)</p>
<p>Marcia Winslade, UCSC Sustainability Assessment Project manager, accepted the award for UC Santa Cruz on April 18 at the Second Annual Campus Sustainability Conference in College Park, Maryland.</p>

In the aftermath of the tragedy that unfolded, students across the nation are carrying many questions about campus safety.  During this past week, I have heard from many parents and students.  Each expressed their deep sadness, shared personal concerns, and asked about UCSC safety practices.</p><p>Immediately after the Virginia Tech incident, you received an <a href="http://messages.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1200">update from Acting Chancellor Blumenthal</a> and <a href="http://messages.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1202">resource information from UCSC Counseling Services</a>. I thought it would be helpful to offer some additional level of reassurance by providing a summary of several of the key safety and emergency response programs that we currently have in place at UCSC.</p><p>Please also share this message with parents and/or other family members who would be interested.</p><p><b>University Police and Fire:</b></p><p>The campus has a fully trained and professional police and fire department.  University Police have the full powers of law enforcement and have access to mutual aid from the City, County, State and Federal law enforcement agencies if needed.</p><p><b>Kiosk Program:</b></p><p>At the two main entrances to the campus, guests coming onto the campus after 8 p.m. must be able to provide ID and either prove their UCSC membership and purpose for entering the campus (i.e., they live on campus, are a staff or faculty member, etc.) or they must have a campus host who will confirm their eligibility for visiting the campus.  In emergency situations, the campus kiosk locations would allow the University to monitor or limit access to the campus if needed.</p><p><b>Communications:</b></p><p>Like most universities, UCSC has the capacity to distribute announcement messages to all students via their email accounts or via the student portal page.  We also have an informational update phone number for students and staff to call (459-INFO) for updates on emergency situations. Residence Hall students have phones in each room that they may use to contact 911 for emergencies or 459-2231 for university dispatch.</p><p><b>Emergency Response Management:</b></p><p>The campus also has an extensive set of protocols and standards in place for managing emergencies.  The Emergency Operations Center is enacted in times of crisis -- this Center is the place for coordinated decision making, resource deployment, communications and other related activities that unfold in an emergency situation.</p><p><b>Student Housing Safety:</b></p><p>. <b>Building Security and Safety</b>.  Residential Students have electronic key card or standard key access to their buildings and a separate key for room access.  Student Housing also has emergency fire alarms and fire sprinklers both in the corridors and rooms/apartments.</p><p>	</p><p>. <b>Residential Staff</b>.  UCSC has a very well trained, responsive and available Residential Staff.  We have full-time professional staff that lives in the residences with the students.  Many of these individuals have backgrounds in counseling and student development and solid experiences in crisis response/crisis management.  Additionally, we have Resident Advisors (RAs) who live on each floor/building with residents.  The RAs are student staff members who have also received extensive training in emergency preparedness and response.</p><p>	</p><p>. <b>Community Safety Officer Program</b>.  In addition to our University Police and Residential Staff, University Housing has a program that is known as the Community Safety Program.  Professional Staff in this program are assigned to work security and safety assignments around and throughout our residential housing areas.  Staff members are available to provide general student support and assistance, ensure door security, enforce university policies and be the eyes and ears at the local housing level to identify and address student safety related issues.  Staff are available from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. daily, 365 days of the year.</p><p><b>Counseling Services:</b></p><p>Support and assistance is available to any UCSC student who is experiencing stress as a result of this incident or other emotional challenges.  Contact information is available at <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/counsel">www2.ucsc.edu/counsel</a> or you may call 459-2628.</p><p>I hope that the above gives you a sense of the UCSC support network for student safety and emergency response.  In addition to the current programs and reporting structures that we have in place, the campus leadership is undertaking a comprehensive review of UCSC programs, protocols and practices for both prevention and response.</p><p>I invite your questions and would also be happy to speak with you directly if you feel that would be helpful.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p><b><i>Jean Marie Scott</i></b></p><p>Acting Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs</p><p><a href="mailto:jmscott@ucsc.edu">jmscott@ucsc.edu</a></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC students</audience><admin>Acting Vice Chancellor Jean Marie Scott</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915181408072704601a012ff1aa09bc2"><name>1220</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Arts Dean finalists to make presentations</title><summary>Three final candidates for the Dean of the Arts position are scheduled to make presentations in April and May on campus and the campus community is invited to attend.</summary><author>Guy Lasnier, (831) 459-5312, lasnier@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>arts dean finalists</keywords><description>Three final candidates for the Dean of the Arts position are scheduled to make presentations in April and May on campus and the campus community is invited to attend.</description><start-date>1177311600000</start-date><display-name>Arts Dean finalists to...</display-name><path>/2007/04/1220</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/04/1220</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338291972</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338291972</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Theater Arts</value><value>History of Art and Visual Culture</value><value>Music</value><value>Film and Digital Media</value><value>Art</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2955</phone><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Three final candidates for the Dean of the Arts position are scheduled to make presentations in April and May on campus and the campus community is invited to attend. </p><p>Each candidate will speak to his or her vision and goals of the deanship and will deliver a scholarly presentation on his or her research interests.</p><p>The final candidates are Professor William Seaman, Rhode Island School of Design; Professor Simon Penny, UC Irvine; and Professor Timothy Murray, Cornell University.</p><p>The candidates' CVs and web links are posted for review at: <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/ahr/OpenPresentations.pdf">http://www2.ucsc.edu/ahr/OpenPresentations.pdf</a>. </p><p>All presentations will take place in Engineering 2, Room 499.

Chancellor George Blumenthal told regional economic and government leaders that UCSC and Santa Cruz County have a unique opportunity to participate in the solution to global warming and boost the local economy.</p>
<p>Blumenthal was one of about three dozen local leaders who gathered at University Center April 19 for the Santa Cruz County Climate Solutions Summit. Santa Cruz County Treasurer Fred Keeley organized the summit, which was cosponsored by Blumenthal, Santa Cruz County Supervisor Neal Coonerty and Santa Cruz Mayor Emily Reilly and coordinated by UCSC's STEPS Institute.</p>
<p>UCSC has "a key opportunity to leverage a unified commitment to the environment," Blumenthal said. "We can lead the way for the county."</p>
<p>Opening the half-day session, Keeley said Santa Cruz has the "economic features that allow us to be part of the solution. It's not about changing the world," he said, "but about saving the world."</p>
<p>Lisa Sloan, professor of Earth sciences and vice provost for graduate education, outlined computer models that show the steepening increases of carbon emissions into the atmosphere along with the concomitant rise in earth temperatures and sea levels.</p>
<p>Blumenthal, Keeley and other local leaders said Santa Cruz is well positioned to take advantage of increased awareness and funding for what's called "green tech" or "clean tech." Growing public awareness of climate change has attracted venture capital funding to a variety of emerging technologies. The hope is that Santa Cruz can attract new high-tech green businesses and thus boost the local economy while helping cut the output of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz has the institutional readiness, the political readiness and the physical readiness, Keeley said, referring to available industrial space throughout the county.</p>
<p>Steve Westly, the former state controller and Democratic candidate for governor, told the group that millions of dollars are available. Westly, a former eBay executive who is now a venture capitalist, said clean tech now represents 14 percent of all venture investment in the world. The premier venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers has established a $200 million green tech fund.</p>
<p>Westly challenged the Santa Cruz group "to establish your image as a clean-tech hub," and urged local leaders to form a delegation to lobby Silicon Valley venture capital firms. "You are so close," he said.</p>

Hamilton.</p>
<p>Music of the Spheres is a benefit summer concert series whose proceeds support the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory (UCO/Lick), a multicampus research unit headquartered at UC Santa Cruz that serves over 100 UC astronomers. Each of the six Music of the Spheres evenings combines a performance by world-acclaimed musicians and a lecture by a renowned astronomy researcher. Afterward, audience members take turns at the historic Lick Telescope, a 36-inch refractor that has been in operation since 1888 and remains the second largest refracting telescope ever built. A cadre of well-trained volunteers assist in these events by sharing their own telescopes and expertise with interested members of the audience.</p>
<p>Music of the Spheres concerts will take place on July 6 and 7, August 3 and 4, and September 7 and 8. Scheduled performances include Celtic music by Golden Bough, new age music of Tingstad &amp; Rumbel, violinist Chung-Pei Ma, jazz by the Kurt Ribak Trio, and guitarists Mimi Fox, Mark Hanson, and Daniel Roest. For additional details and ticket information, visit the Lick Observatory <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/public/music.html">web site</a>.</p>
<p>Tickets for each Music of the Spheres evening are offered at three levels: general ($30), preferred ($100), and VIP ($150). All tickets include the concert, astronomy talk, viewing session through the 36-inch telescope, and a commemorative wineglass or coffee cup. Preferred ticket holders have the additional benefits of reserved seating and a 20 percent discount at the gift shop. A VIP ticket further entitles visitors to a behind-the-scenes tour of the 120-inch Shane reflecting telescope and a light buffet. VIP ticket sales begin on May 8, and preferred and general tickets will be available starting May 15.</p>
<p>Another popular program offered by Lick Observatory is the Summer Visitors Program, which gives the public access to both the 36-inch Lick Telescope and the 40-inch Anna Nickel Reflector, a telescope scientists currently use to spot planets outside the solar system. As with the Music of the Spheres events, amateur astronomer volunteers provide additional outside viewing and informal talks. Each program also features two speakers to ensure an interesting evening even if bad weather prevents stargazing. The lectures include a history of Lick Observatory and multimedia presentations by Lick astronomers.</p>
<p>Dates for the Summer Visitors Program are June 22 and 23 at 8 p.m., July 20 and 21 at 7:30 p.m., and August 17 and 18 at 7 p.m. Tickets are $5 and will be made available through a lottery system, with a limit of four tickets per request.

An outspoken scholar and cultural critic, she has published more than 30 books and numerous articles focusing on the politics of race, class, and gender, and how they produce and perpetuate systems of oppression and domination. </p><p>In 1992, a <i>Publishers Weekly</i> poll named her book <i>Ain't I A Woman: Black Women and Feminism</i>-about the impact of sexism and racism on black women-as "one of the twenty most influential women's books of the last twenty years." <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> has described her as "one of our nation's leading public intellectuals," and <i>Utne Reader</i> called her one of "100 Visionaries Who Could Change Your Life." </p><p>hooks has taught at the University of Southern California, Oberlin College, Yale University, UC Santa Cruz, and as Distinguished Professor of English at the City College of New York. She has appeared in several documentary films, including <i>Give a Damn Again</i> (1995) with Princeton professor and best-selling author Cornel West, with whom she co-wrote the 1991 book <i>Breaking Bread: Insurgent Black Intellectual Life</i>. </p><p>hooks's visit is being facilitated by Roberta Valdez, director of the Women's Center at UC Santa Cruz. Valdez initiated a reading and discussion group for the campus community last winter quarter that focused on three books written by hooks about love: <i>All About Love: New Visions</i> (2000), <i>Communion: The Female Search for Love</i> (2002), and <i>The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity and Love</i> (2003). UCSC philosophy professor and Stevenson College provost Ellen Suckiel learned of the group and helped Valdez create a UCSC class around the reading group, which was offered during winter quarter and provided students with a survey of hooks's works. </p><p>"Our goal in bringing bell hooks back to the campus is to have her be accessible to the many students who have been influenced by her writings," said Valdez. "We are arranging for her to have informal dialogues prior to her lecture with the students who participated in the class last winter."</p><p>"Her work is very important because it asks us to examine how we've been socialized and look at the personal decisions we've made in our lives before we go outside to change the world," Valdez added. "Everything she writes about is really all related to the idea of social justice."</p><p>This event is sponsored by the UCSC Women's Center, Chicano Latino Resource Center, Stevenson College, the Alumni Association, C.A.R.E., Porter College, Institute for Humanities Research, Film and Digital Media Department, Department of Literature, Feminist Studies Department, and Colleges Nine and Ten. Doors open at 4:30 p.m. Seating is limited and there will be an overflow simulcast at College Nine's Namaste Lounge.

The event takes place on the East Field track on Thursday, May 10, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Space is limited to the first 65 teams to register; registration ends May 6.</p><p>The lighthearted competition involves four-member relay teams traveling two miles (one-half mile per person) around the East Field track. Each team tries to predict--in minutes and seconds--how long they will need to complete the two miles. Participants do not have to walk or run fast to win the event--the closest actual time to the predicted time wins. </p><p>Participants will all receive free T-shirts, and multiple prizes will be awarded, including one for best baton. While the emphasis is on fun, the event also has a serious side, with wellness activities and health information offered. The event is open to all staff and faculty members. </p><p>For more information, go to the <a href="http://www.ucscrecreation.com/index.php?link_id=51">OPERS web site</a>.

William Domhoff says the best thing that ever happened to him professionally was being hired as a founding faculty member at UC Santa Cruz in 1965. The second-best thing was retiring early, which gave him the freedom to focus on his research.</p><p>Since he retired as professor of psychology and sociology in 1994, Domhoff has pursued two scholarly interests--dreams and power relations--with the zeal of a graduate student. His contributions were recognized this month when Domhoff received the University of California's Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award.</p><p>The award, which honors the postretirement contributions of UC faculty, was presented this year to Domhoff and Robert O. Collins, professor emeritus of history at UC Santa Barbara.</p><p>"Coming to UCSC gave me total freedom, and retiring early gave the time to focus on my research on dreams and power," said Domhoff, a pioneer in two fields, the study of U.S. power relations and the theory and practice of quantitative dream analysis. He retired at the age of 57 as part of an early-retirement incentive program created by UC during the budget crisis of the early 1990s.</p><p>Domhoff is widely regarded as the foremost authority on the structure of power in the United States. His book <i>Who Rules America?</i> is a classic in the field of sociology. A fifth edition and an accompanying web site, whorulesamerica.net, were published in 2006. Two new books, <i>Diversity in the Power Elite</i> and <i>Blacks in the White Elite</i>, coauthored with R. L. Zweigenhaft, examine how people get to the top--or not--when they are from groups that have previously had limited access to power. </p><p>Domhoff traces his fascination with power to the early 1960s, when the civil rights movement and social unrest sparked an awakening. "I grew up in an apolitical family in the Midwest, and power was never a part of my life until the 1960s," he said. "I began to read about the upper class and the power elite, and it opened up a whole different world." </p><p>In his 2003 book, <i>Changing the Powers That Be</i>, Domhoff attempts to reorient citizen-activists and intellectuals toward policies and strategies that have been largely overlooked. Harvey Molotch, a sociologist at New York University, described the book as "passionate in the best sense of the term--heartfelt urgings from someone who has invested a scholarly lifetime in efforts to figure out what is really going on and how to change things for the better."  </p><p>Since retiring, Domhoff has also published two books and about a dozen articles and book chapters on dreams, including the books <i>Finding Meaning in Dreams</i> (1996) and <i>The Scientific Study of Dreams</i> (2003). </p><p>Domhoff has continued to teach, both at UCSC and at various other universities. In 2004, he was elected chair of the political sociology section of the American Sociological Association. He is currently working on an academic book about rival theories of urban power structures that focuses on the city of Santa Cruz. "Santa Cruz is the only city in the country that has been run by leftists for 25 years," he said. "Just about every other city in the country is run by landowners, developers, and downtown business interests."</p><p>Domhoff has a bachelor's degree from Duke University, a master's degree from Kent State University, and his Ph.D. from the University of Miami. He began his career as an assistant professor of psychology at California State University, Los Angeles.</p><p>The Constantine Panunzio Award, which carries a $5,000 prize, was created in 1983 by a bequest from Panunzio, a UCLA sociology professor who has been described as the architect of the UC Retirement System. The award honors outstanding scholarly work and/or educational service since retirement by UC faculty emeriti in the humanities or social sciences. Nominations are submitted to each campus's Emeriti Association, reviewed by campus provosts, and presented to a board of directors that selects the recipient(s).</p><p>Domhoff's fellow recipient, Robert Collins, is a recognized world authority on Africa, with particular expertise in the Sudan and the Nile River. He has shared his expertise with scholars, as well as with governments, the news media, filmmakers, and television producers. Collins has published 15 books since he retired in 1994.</p><p>#####</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91519a058072704601a012ff0817390a"><name>1239</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Information on Sharing Copyrighted Materials</title><start-date>1177570800000</start-date><display-name>Information on Sharing Copyrighted...</display-name><path>/2007/04/1239</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/04/1239</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338298279</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338298279</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Copying and sharing copyrighted materials without permission of the</p><p>copyright owner is a violation of federal law.  To comply with the law and</p><p>to protect yourself from possible litigation, we strongly encourage you to remove illegally obtained copyrighted material from your computer, and to stop downloading copyrighted material illegally if you do so now.</p><p>As you may know, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), and some other copyright owners and groups have recently stepped up their efforts to curb illegal file sharing on the Internet.  This academic year, the University has received a much larger volume of complaints about peer-to-peer file sharing than in previous years.  In addition, the RIAA is sending "early settlement" letters (see below) to colleges around the country as part of its new anti-theft campaign announced in January; see press release at: <a href="http://www.riaa.com/news/newsletter/032107.asp">http://www.riaa.com/news/newsletter/032107.asp</a></p><p>This is an opportune time to remind you of relevant policies and practices at UC Santa Cruz.</p><p>DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) "take-down" notices: Federal law requires that the University take action when it is notified that someone on its network is distributing copyrighted materials without permission. Whether you are aware of the violation or not, if UC Santa Cruz's DMCA agent receives a "takedown notice" alleging that your computer is distributing copyrighted material without permission, the University follows established policy enforcement procedures, see: <a href="http://resnet.ucsc.edu/besmart/filesharing/">http://resnet.ucsc.edu/besmart/filesharing/</a> <a href="http://security.ucsc.edu/policies/dmca.shtml">http://security.ucsc.edu/policies/dmca.shtml</a></p><p>Early Settlement Letters:</p><p>As a courtesy, the University of California has agreed to forward "early settlement" letters to students on the campus network who the RIAA alleges have shared copyrighted material illegally.  The University will send a cover letter along with the RIAA early settlement letter to the student's campus email address, as well as to his/her permanent address.

The study, published April 27 in the journal <i>Science,</i> identifies a critical link in the processes that determine the ocean's ability to absorb and store the carbon dioxide that is accumulating in our atmosphere.</p><p>Some of the carbon incorporated into the cells of marine plants ultimately sinks into the depths of the ocean, where it is stored and prevented from reentering the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas. But a surprisingly large amount of the carbon carried below the surface layer by sinking particles of organic matter (known as "marine snow") gets consumed by animals and bacteria and recycled within the "twilight zone," a dim region from 100 to 1,000 meters below the surface.</p><p>Using new technology, the researchers found that only 20 percent of the total carbon in the ocean surface made it through the twilight zone off Hawaii, while 50 percent did in the northwest Pacific near Japan. </p><p>The study builds on pioneering investigations of marine snow begun in the 1970s by Mary Silver, professor of ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Silver, a coauthor of the new paper, was the first scientist to take a close look at the small flocs and flakes of nonliving particles that drift down through the water. Her findings showed that marine snow is a major source of sinking organic matter in the world's oceans and is the site of intense microbial activity.</p><p>Now, researchers have found that the twilight zone acts as a "gate," allowing more sinking particles through in some regions and fewer in others. These findings complicate the efforts of climate modelers to predict the ocean's role in offsetting the impacts of greenhouse gases. </p><p>"The twilight zone is a critical link between the surface and the deep ocean. Unless the carbon that gets into the ocean goes all the way down into the deep ocean and is stored there, the carbon can still make its way back into the atmosphere," said Ken Buesseler, a biogeochemist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and lead author of the new study in <i>Science,</i> coauthored by 17 other scientists. "Without long-term carbon storage at depth, the ocean can do little to stem the increase in atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide," he said.</p><p>Buesseler was a leader of the ambitious project, funded primarily by the U.S. National Science Foundation, called VERTIGO (VERtical Transport In the Global Ocean). More than 40 biologists, chemists, physical oceanographers, and engineers from 14 institutions and seven countries participated in the two VERTIGO cruises in 2004 and 2005 to investigate the fate of the carbon in marine plants that die and sink or are eaten by animals and converted into sinking fecal pellets.</p><p>Silver was one of two biologists who conducted shipboard studies of seawater samples collected during the cruises--identifying plankton, characterizing the communities of organisms in each location, and trying to understand how different communities influence the marine carbon cycle. Working alongside Silver was her former graduate student Deborah Steinberg, who did her doctoral research on marine snow at UCSC and is now at the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences. </p><p>"It's the biology of the system--the plants that fix the carbon and the animals that graze on them--that makes the system variable," Silver said. "More or less carbon gets carried into the deep waters depending on which organisms are present."</p><p>Sinking particles of marine snow supply food to organisms deeper down, including bacteria that decompose the particles. In the process, carbon is converted back into dissolved organic and inorganic forms that are recirculated and reused in the twilight zone and can make their way to the surface and back into the atmosphere.</p><p>In the North Pacific, an ecosystem in which diatoms (a type of microscopic algae) dominate in the surface layer proved to be more efficient in transporting organic carbon through the twilight zone than the ecosystem at the site near Hawaii. Understanding exactly which factors are responsible for this difference will require further study. </p><p>"We know very little about this layer, the twilight zone, where organic material either passes through or gets burned up and returns as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere," Silver said.</p><p>But the new findings show that the ocean is not as big a sink for atmospheric carbon as was once thought, she said. Widely used estimates of carbon sequestration in the oceans have been largely derived from an earlier project, called VERTEX, in which Silver also participated in the 1980s. </p><p>"Our new work is showing that the earlier model of carbon sequestration was very simplistic. We now have to make a more sophisticated model that takes into account the variations in the amount of carbon sequestered in the deep sea," she said.</p><p>Silver noted that the VERTIGO study benefited from a diverse group of scientists contributing perspectives from a wide range of disciplines, including chemistry, physics, biology, and engineering. The sites off Hawaii and Japan were selected because they had been the focus of long-term ocean observations by coauthors David Karl (University of Hawaii) and Makio Honda (Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology). Thomas Trull (University of Tasmania, Australia), Philip Boyd (University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand), and Frank Dehairs (Free University of Brussels, Belgium) all study the Southern Ocean and could provide important perspectives contrasting ocean carbon cycles off Antarctica and in VERTIGO. David Siegel (UC Santa Barbara) helped track the ocean currents and pathways of the sinking particles. Along with WHOI engineers, James Bishop (UC Berkeley) brought new tools to study the abundance and composition of particles in the twilight zone.</p><p>"This combination of expertise could not be found in any single lab or country," Buesseler said. "We were fortunate to attract such a diverse group of talented scientists willing to unravel the secrets of the twilight zone and its role in the global carbon cycle."</p><p>______</p><p><b>Additional media contacts:</b></p><p>WHOI Media Relations Office: (508) 289-3340 or media@whoi.edu</p><p>Mary Silver: (831) 459-2908 or msilver@ucsc.edu</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91519d178072704601a012ffd150ba60"><name>1241</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Dickson Emeriti Professorship awarded to Harold Widom</title><summary>Harold Widom, professor emeritus of mathematics, has been awarded this year's Edward A.

Dickson Emeriti Professorship. The award, announced by Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger and Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Alison Galloway, will enable the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences to offer a graduate course in complex analysis to be taught by Widom during the winter quarter of the 2007-08 academic year.</p><p>Widom received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1955 and joined the UCSC faculty in 1968. His early research was in the areas of integral equations and operator theory, although he has also made important contributions in an area of mathematics called random matrix theory. His work with collaborator Craig Tracy of UC Davis led to the discovery of a new class of distribution functions called Tracy-Widom distributions. For their work, Widom and Tracy shared the prestigious George Pólya Prize in 2002 and the 2007 Norbert Wiener Prize in Applied Mathematics. </p><p>Widom was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006.  Since his retirement, he has remained an active member of the UCSC faculty and continues to teach when possible.</p><p>The Dickson Professorship is the result of a gift from Edward A. Dickson, who served as a UC Regent from 1913 to 1946, the longest tenure of any Regent. In 1955, Dickson presented the university with an endowment to support special annual professorships to be awarded to retired faculty members. Every year, each campus in the UC system receives a portion of the income from this endowment to fund these professorships.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9151a0e18072704601a012ffc8fb9acf"><name>1243</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Art meets science in campus Earth Day mural project</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1177657200000</start-date><display-name>Art meets science in...</display-name><path>/2007/04/1243</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/04/1243</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338300075</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338300075</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>History of Art and Visual Culture</value><value>Art</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/04/images/amanda.amelia.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/04/images/amanda.amelia.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>amanda.amelia.jpg</name><file-size>26274</file-size><width>300</width><height>266</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>UCSC art students Amanda Porter and Amelia  Katkov created this painting for the fourth-floor greenhouse at Thimann Laboratories.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/04/images/tokubo.kelly.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/04/images/tokubo.kelly.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tokubo.kelly.jpg</name><file-size>22278</file-size><width>300</width><height>225</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Art student Kelly Tokubo at work on the mural (photos by Christine Bors)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Ten UCSC art students spent Earth Day weekend creating a mural project at the Thimann Laboratories Greenhouse. The project was organized by Christine Bors, a senior art student and the educational outreach coordinator for the Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery. </p><p>"We had a team of volunteers painting a nature and scientific-themed mural to welcome the Arts Division into the science area of UCSC," said Bors. "It seems as if these two areas are often separated and the project was constructed to get students to unite together across different disciplines and divisions."</p><p>The mural-funded by the Sesnon Art Gallery and Stevenson College-is located on the fourth-floor greenhouse of Thimann Labs. The students used recycled paint for the entire mural, obtained from the city landfill on Dimeo Lane off Highway 1. Bors and greenhouse manager Jim Velzy collaborated in planning the project for the past six months.</p><p>Bors noted that the mural layout is consistent with environmental and plant life themes and is divided into 10 sequences, including underwater and terrestrial plant life, coastal plant life, Santa Cruz landscapes, and scientific explorations.</p><p>"Overall it was a fantastic event," noted Bors. "The Thimann Greenhouse walls are lively and filled with really bright and beautiful imagery. It's nice to incorporate the arts and sciences together on campus; I think this mural is a symbol of that union, and hopefully it can be the first of many such projects within the science and engineering departments at UCSC."</p><p>The artists who took part in the project are: Christine Bors, Amanda Porter, Emily Reese, Margaret Holland, Marcy Smith, Kelly Tokubo, Amelia Clare Katkov, Lauren Tedeschi, Evergreen Torres, and Dana Vallarino.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9151a3528072704601a012ffcc5c9f3c"><name>1245</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Eco Health and Wellness Fair is May 8</title><summary>The annual Wellness Fair has expanded its focus this year to become the Eco Health and Wellness Fair, a collaboration between the Wellness Center and the Student Health Outreach and Promotion (SHOP).

Among them is Joseph DeRisi (Crown '92) who made the front page of the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> last week for his efforts to identify the genetic code of bugs suspected of wiping out a quarter of the nation's honeybees. Alumni, Blumenthal addded, "help build UCSC's reputation both nationally and internationally." </p><p>After lunch, Philip Berman, Chair of Biomolecular Engineering, discussed "Challenges in the Development of an AIDS Vaccine" at the Distinguished Faculty Lecture. Sixty eight million people worldwide have HIV, he noted, and an AIDS vaccine could be an important tool in slowing the spread of the disease. He described the decades of scientific and clinical effort involved in the vaccine development, and special challenges, including the virus' mutability. The clinical trial with which Berman was associated was not ultimately successful, but its findings may yet hold the key to future approaches.</p><p>Cheryl Scott (Oakes '74) was the first of two panelists who formally responded to Berman's remarks. "We need to lobby and be advocates for AIDS prevention, not just treatment," she said; adding that national medical budget priorities have not always done this. Scott speaks from experience; she is an award-winning medical epidemiologist at the California Department of Health Services Tuberculosis Control Branch and the former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Global AIDS Program in Tanzania.</p><p>Gordon Ringold (Crown '72) responded next. "We've had the Nixon-era 'War on Cancer;' today, we need a concerted government program to support basic science that will help us make inroads in [AIDS] vaccine's development," he said. Ringold is chairman and CEO of Alavita Inc., which develops therapeutics for treatment of stroke, heart attack, and organ transplantation; he is also vice president of the UCSC Foundation.</p><p>The room was full for Oakes College's 35th Anniversary panel discussion at which Acting Chancellor Blumenthal introduced the college's founding provost, J. Herman Blake, "who has transformed the lives of thousands of students and teachers throughout the United States."  </p><p>"We started with an idea and a cow pasture," Blake recalled, with faculty that had "an unending belief in the potential of every student and in excellence for every student." He reminded the audience that "we are the custodians of the past and trustees of the future." </p><p>After Blake's remarks and those from Anthropology Professor Adrienne Zihlman, former Oakes administrative officer Ron Saufley, Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger, Anthropology Professor Emerita Diane Lewis, and retiring Lecturer in Writing Don Rothman, an alumna in the audience shared her own recollections. Years ago, Blake approved her plan to leave college for a break only after she agreed to return. That 10-minute conversation, she said, changed her life; she soon re-enrolled, and is now an attorney.</p><p>A dedication ceremony and reception celebrated UCSC's new Humanities Building. Dean of Humanities Georges Van Den Abbeele discussed "The Humanities: Present and Future;" Peggy Downes Baskin talked about the importance of humanities and the Humanities Chair for Interdisciplinary Studies in Ethics which she endowed. The festivities "went green" as Don Amuzie, senior program manager for Pacific Gas and Electric, presented "Savings by Design" prizes for the building's outstanding energy efficiency to Acting Chancellor Blumenthal (a $57,382 "Owner Incentive Award") and to Thomas Hacker Architects (the $19,128 "Design Team Incentive Award"). </p><p>The entire campus rolled out the red carpet for alumni. Department-sponsored events included opera performances; reunions for physics, education, psychology, and all sciences; and the Baskin School of Engineering 10th anniversary celebration. Receptions were offered at every college--Crown's 40th anniversary highlighted women in science, and Cowell hosted a retirement celebration for professor of classics John Lynch. Specialty events were held for alumni parents of college-age students; the class of 1972; Asian-American and Pacific Islander alumni; Jewish alumni; and gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and intersex alumni. Student Organization Advising and Resources (SOAR) sponsored a reunion, and about 50 alumni turned out for a dinner "celebration of access and achievement" former participants in the EOP Summer Bridge Program. </p><p>Many alumni concluded their campus visits at the Alumni Association's popular Alumni Vintners Wine Tasting, featuring wines from 15 vintners, gourmet treats by five chefs, and live jazz -all provided by UCSC graduates.</p><p><i>A gallery of photos from Banana Slug Spring Fair is available <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/reunions/bssf_2007_pics/index.htm">online</a>.</i></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>April 30, 2007</audience><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9151a68e8072704601a012ff663359dc"><name>1247</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Eminent chemist to discuss primordial genetic materials in annual Bunnett Lecture on Friday, May 4</title><summary>The renowned organic chemist Albert Eschenmoser will give the 2007 Joseph F.

Bunnett Research Organic Chemistry Lecture on Friday, May 4. Eschenmoser's lecture, "The Search for Potentially Primordial Genetic Materials," will take place at 5 p.m. in the Baskin Engineering Auditorium.</p><p>Eschenmoser is a professor emeritus of organic chemistry at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and research professor at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla. In his talk, he will give a survey of experimental efforts toward a chemical etiology of nucleic acid structure and discuss recent results of a search for potentially primordial informational oligomer systems.</p><p>Eschenmoser is best known for his many contributions to synthetic methodology, structure elucidation, synthesis of natural products, physical organic chemistry, and, more recently, experiments on the etiology of nucleic acids aimed at an understanding of the chemical criteria by which nature chose nucleic acids as its genetic code. Among his contributions to natural products chemistry, his stereochemical interpretation of the biogenetic isoprene rule is particularly well known. </p><p>Perhaps his overall most outstanding achievement has been the total synthesis (with R. B. Woodward) of vitamin B12, a molecule of incredible complexity and, at the time, the Holy Grail of synthetic chemistry.</p><p>For additional information about this lecture, please call the Chemistry Department at (831) 459-4823.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9151a85c8072704601a012ffb13a3ac0"><name>1248</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>RSVP to Staff Appreciation Breakfast</title><start-date>1177916400000</start-date><display-name>RSVP to Staff Appreciation...</display-name><path>/2007/04/1248</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/04/1248</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338301959</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338301959</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Staff Advisory Board would like to invite all UCSC staff employees to join us for our annual Pancake Breakfast; Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal will be there to express appreciation for the great work staff contributes to the campus throughout the year.</p><p>This year's breakfast will take place on Tuesday, May 15, from 7:30 to 9:30 a.m. in the Cowell Dining Hall.</p><p>Supervisors are encouraged to provide employees with release time to participate in this event.

But how might people memorialize "a crime perpetrated in their name"? When the Berlin Senate commissioned a panel to select the design for Germany's national "Memorial to Europe's Murdered Jews," they had to grapple with this question. Alumnus James E. Young, an international expert on the construction of memorials, was among them.</p><p>Young was at UCSC on Friday, April 27, to describe and illustrate his experience in a multimedia presentation entitled "Berlin's Holocaust Memorial Problem--And Mine." The public talk was part of a literature and history course on the Holocaust, taught by history professor Peter Kenez and Murray Baumgarten, professor of English and Comparative Literature and director of UCSC's Jewish studies program. Some 250 students, staff, and faculty attended.</p><p>Young took his audience on a fascinating tour of contemporary memorials around the globe. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., designed by architect Maya Lin, has strongly influenced other architects with its minimalist design: a granite wall inscribed with the names of dead and missing American soldiers, so shiny that viewers see their own image superimposed on the list of names. Designs such as this can "show you yourself, and help you reflect on your own need for memory," Young said.</p><p>Some memorials do this in innovative ways, according to Young. One commemorated Nazi book-burnings with an empty underground "book room;" as they look through glass tiles in the ground, viewers literally bow their heads in contemplation. Elsewhere in Europe, elevated cobblestones, each with the name of a murdered Jewish family, literally trip up pedestrians. At the Berlin memorial, viewers get lost in a sea of rectangle forms. These memorials can help us realize that "what we need to remember is not the destruction, but the void left behind," he said.</p><p>With Young's help, New York's 9/11 memorial may achieve this as well. In 2003, he was appointed by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation to the jury for the World Trade Center Site Memorial competition. That memorial is now under construction.</p><p>During his visit to UCSC, Young said he felt indebted to UCSC-"where I became a humanist." After earning his bachelor's degree in psychology and literature in 1973, the Stevenson graduate went on to get his Ph.D. in literature from UCSC in 1983.</p><p>Young is professor of English and Judaic Studies at the University of Massachusetts, and chair of the Department of Judaic and Near Eastern Studies. He is the author of several books, including The Texture of Memory (Yale University Press, 1993), which won the National Jewish Book Award in 1994.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915274b98072704601a012ffc2d2c200"><name>1428</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni Profile: Across a Hundred Mountains</title><summary>Born in rural Mexico, UC Santa Cruz alumna Reyna Grande grew up in extreme poverty.

Before she crossed the border to live in Los Angeles at the age of eight, she lived in a cardboard shack with a dirt floor and no running water. She bathed in a dirty canal outside and survived on a diet of only beans and tortillas.</p>
<p>Overcoming the language barrier and her status as an undocumented immigrant in the United States, Grande made the most of her new home, eventually earning a bachelor's degree in creative writing/film &amp; video from UC Santa Cruz in 1999. For her senior project in UCSC's Literature Department, she even wrote the first 80 pages of her debut novel, Across a Hundred Mountains.</p>
<p>The book is now required reading in core courses at UCSC's Porter and Kresge Colleges.</p>
<p>Across a Hundred Mountains illustrates the perils of immigration and crossing the U.S. border, the heartbreaking cycle of poverty, and the fractured family ties and identities of those who make it to the other side. Inspired by her own life -- Grande's father left her to work in the U.S. when she was only a year old -- the novel was published in 2006 to critical acclaim.</p>
<p>As People magazine noted: "Grande's spare, elegantly written tale of a young Mexican girl searching for her farmworker father, missing since he left to seek his fortune in 'el otro lado', is a timely and riveting read."</p>
<p>That the novel is filled with details drawn from Grande's own life adds immeasurably to the poignancy of the story.</p>
<p>"The poverty -- that's very real to my experience," she says. "There's a scene where my character goes to the market and is picking up rotten vegetables out of the trash cans. My sister in Mexico had a habit of picking up things off the ground -- a lollipop or a piece of fruit -- and eating them, just because we didn't have any food."</p>
<p>"I wrote this story because all of the books that I read, especially those by Latino authors, never quite captured my own experience," Grande adds. "A lot of books deal with the children of immigrants -- what they go through and their identity as U.S.-born Latinos. I always felt a little left out because I wasn't born here, and these stories weren't reflecting my personal experience."</p>
<p>Grande decided to attend UCSC on the recommendation of an English teacher at Pasadena City College who thought it would be an ideal, intimate learning environment for her. "Every time she read my essays, she told me to be a writer," Grande recalls. "She steered me to UCSC because she thought it was a place where I could discover myself as a person."</p>
<p>After graduating, Grande was named a 2003 PEN USA Emerging Voices Fellow, which gave her access to free writing classes at UCLA, as well as the opportunity to meet with agents and publishers in the literary world. "That's how I met my agent," says Grande. "I approached her after she gave a presentation, told her about my book, and we soon began working together."</p>
<p>Now a U.S. citizen, Grande lives in Los Angeles with her four-year-old son. When she's not busy working on her next novel -- the story of four women in a Los Angeles-based folklorico group -- Grande helps other immigrants transition into the country by teaching adult English. "I feel really happy that I've been able to do all these things; I know if I stayed in Mexico, I wouldn't have been able to do anything meaningful with my life," she says. "Living in the United States has made me aim high and try to be an example for others."</p>
<p>Since Across a Hundred Mountains was published, Grande has given more than 30 readings in Los Angeles and across the Southwest, including several visits to creative writing classes at UCSC. In light of the recent debates in Congress and increased media focus on immigration, she hopes that her book will offer readers a unique perspective on the politically charged issue.</p>
<p>"Instead of building fences, the U.S. should deal with illegal immigration by helping Mexico improve its economy," observes Grande. "Because I experienced the poverty in Mexico, I understand why people are so desperate to come to this country. But even if you build a fence, people are still starving and will still want to come here; the risks will rise, but the people won't go away. It would be much more humane to help the people in Mexico so they would not be so desperate to come here."</p>

<p>UC Santa Cruz will celebrate its new Humanities Building with a reception and dedication ceremony on April 28 during the campus&#8217;s annual Banana Slug Spring Fair. The event is free and the public is invited.</p>
<p>From 3 to 4 p.m., the Humanities Division will host a reception featuring graduate student research in history, literature, philosophy, linguistics, and history of consciousness--along with live music, food, departmental displays, and the opportunity to interact with humanities faculty, students, and staff. Faculty authors will be available to talk about their recent publications and sign copies of their books.</p>
<p>The building dedication ceremony and ribbon-cutting event will begin at 4 p.m. UCSC&#8217;s Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal will speak about the significance of the humanities for the campus, while new Dean of Humanities Georges Van Den Abbeele will give a talk titled: &#8220;The Humanities: Present and Future.&#8221; Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education William Ladusaw will also speak about the design and concept of the Humanities Building complex.</p>
<p>In addition, Peggy Downes Baskin, research associate in feminist studies, will discuss her husband Jack Baskin&#8217;s recent gift to the university in her honor--the&#160;<em>Peggy Downes Baskin Endowed Humanities Chair for Interdisciplinary Studies in Ethics</em>&#8212;and her interest in ethical issues. Professor of literature and feminist studies Helene Moglen--UCSC dean of humanities from 1978 to 1983--will open the program and act as emcee.</p>
<p>The six-story Humanities 1 Building is now the home of nearly all faculty, departmental, and administrative offices for the Humanities Division. It is part of a $29.3 million complex that includes a 300-seat Humanities Lecture Hall, a landscaped courtyard with redwood benches, and a four-story adjacent structure that provides additional classroom space and computer labs for both the Humanities and Social Sciences Divisions. The building complex is located north of Cowell College at the northwest corner of Hagar and McLaughlin Drives.</p>
<p>Completed in late 2006, the new facilities now give the humanities a tangible presence on campus&#8212;not only centralizing faculty, staff, and students, but also making events and programs more visible and accessible to other campus community members and the general public.</p>
<p>"The new Humanities Building is significant because for the first time in the history of the campus, it brings together the majority of faculty teaching in the humanities fields,&#8221; noted Van Den Abbeele. &#8220;And it does so in close proximity to the founding site of the campus and to Cowell and Stevenson Colleges, which have been traditionally focused on the humanities," he added.</p>
<p>All dedication events are free and open to the public. For more information, contact the UCSC Humanities Division at (831) 459-2696.</p>
