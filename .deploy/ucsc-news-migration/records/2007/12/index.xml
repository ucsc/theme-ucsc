The city will use the funds to cover the cost of overtime for extra officers during peak party hours, approximately 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. UCSC will also provide officers, when requested by the Santa Cruz Police Department, to bolster the city's staffing. In addition, UCSC will continue to publish and distribute information to students about being good neighbors.</p><p>"Over the last year, these funds have allowed us to dedicate specific patrols to problem areas in our community," said Santa Cruz Chief of Police Howard Skerry. "Partnership with the university is essential to addressing these issues in our neighborhoods."</p><p>UCSC made its initial contribution in early 2007 after members of Santa Cruz Neighbors met with Chancellor George Blumenthal to describe the impacts large parties have on their neighborhoods. Recognizing that some of the parties are hosted by or include UCSC students, Blumenthal offered financial assistance to complement and strengthen the city's ability to enforce the ordinance.</p><p>"When I met with members of the Santa Cruz Neighbors group last year, they communicated that large parties--whether or not they involve UCSC students--have a significant impact on their quality of life," said Blumenthal. "So I have decided to once again commit UCSC funds to help the city's police department address this issue." </p><p>Skerry noted that in the past year, the funds supported 68 separate patrol shifts where officers issued a total of 81 noise-related citations.</p><p>						</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91544b978072704601a012ffd107c88b"><name>1788</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Senate Executive Committee message on Science Hill protest</title><start-date>1196751600000</start-date><display-name>Senate Executive Committee message...</display-name><path>/2007/12/1788</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/12/1788</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338474854</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338474854</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Quentin Williams, chair of the UCSC Academic Senate, distributed the following message to UCSC Faculty on behalf of the Senate Executive Committee:</p><p>"The Academic Senate fully supports the rights of members of the campus community to peaceful and civil protest. Indeed, universities aspire to be places in which passionate disagreement about complex issues can occur in a constructive and thought-provoking manner. However, over the last several weeks, we have seen behavior that has adversely affected the campus instructional mission.  These actions jeopardize the freedom to teach and study of our faculty, students, and campus guests. They include: vandalism that has resulted in the ongoing lock-down of some buildings on Science Hill, preventing students from access to their professors; disruption of a systemwide Students of Color conference by protesters, requiring the intervention of police; targeting of UCSC faculty on protesters' website; and an unpleasant, potentially hazardous campus environment associated with protesters' public urination and garbage near academic buildings and a heavily used campus walkway. The Senate Executive Committee wishes to support the academic freedom to teach and study without disruption,and we condemn any actions that threaten the academic mission and environment of our campus. </p><p>"We urge faculty to engage those involved in such actions in a discussion of appropriate and non-counter-productive means of protest--surely, the UCSC community has the imagination to produce forms of protest that do not impact the academic freedoms, instructional mission, or environment of our campus."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Faculty</audience><admin>Quentin Williams, Chair of Academic Senate</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91544d1f8072704601a012ffdbc1f15a"><name>1789</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC appoints Joseph Miller as Vice Provost for Silicon Valley Initiatives</title><summary>Joseph Miller, a longtime professor of astronomy with extensive experience in leadership and administrative positions, has been selected to guide and expand UC Santa Cruz's research and educational programs in Silicon Valley.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Joseph Miller, Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley Initiatives</keywords><description>Joseph Miller, a longtime professor of astronomy with extensive experience in leadership and administrative positions, has been selected to guide and expand UC Santa Cruz's research and educational programs in Silicon Valley.</description><start-date>1197270000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC appoints Joseph Miller...</display-name><path>/2007/12/1789</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/12/1789</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338475210</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338475210</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Appointments</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/12/images/miller_200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/12/images/miller_200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>miller_200.jpg</name><file-size>52120</file-size><width>200</width><height>257</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Joseph Miller</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Joseph Miller, a longtime professor of astronomy with extensive experience in leadership and administrative positions, has been selected to guide and expand UC Santa Cruz's research and educational programs in Silicon Valley. His appointment as Vice Provost for Silicon Valley Initiatives is awaiting final approval by the UC Office of the President.  </p><p>As Vice Provost, Miller will oversee the conception, development, and implementation of the campus's programs and partnerships in Silicon Valley. He previously served as director of UC Observatories/Lick Observatory (UCO/Lick) from 1991 to 2005 and has been a member of the UCSC faculty since 1968. </p><p>"Joe Miller has had notable success guiding major multi-institutional endeavors, such as the construction of the W. M. Keck Observatory while he was director of UC Observatories," said UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal. "He is an excellent administrator, and I look forward to working with him as we continue to build on UCSC's impressive array of research and educational activities in Silicon Valley."</p><p>As director of UCO/Lick, Miller was responsible for the oversight and leadership of the Lick Observatory and UC's share of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii on behalf of the entire UC system. The Keck Observatory is a joint effort involving UC, Caltech, and NASA.</p><p>"I see the Silicon Valley Initiatives as an outstanding opportunity for UCSC to develop exciting new programs, and my goal is to keep those new developments tightly coupled to the Santa Cruz campus," Miller said.</p><p>UCSC's Silicon Valley Center, located in the NASA Research Park, is the base for a growing number of innovative educational and research programs, many of which involve partnerships with the region's private industries, government agencies, and educational institutions. The University Affiliated Research Center (UARC), a partnership between UC and NASA, is a 10-year, $330 million research contract managed by UCSC, with NASA and UCSC scientists working side by side on critical research tasks. The Advanced Studies Laboratories (ASL), a strategic joint venture of UCSC and NASA, emphasizes integrative, interdisciplinary science and the kinds of crossover technologies that fuel innovation. UCSC is also spearheading the establishment of the Bio-Info-Nano Research and Development Institute (BIN-RDI) in partnership with NASA and industry, pursuing breakthrough technologies based on the convergence of biotechnology, information technology, and nanotechnology. </p><p>Miller's responsibilities as vice provost will include providing oversight of not only the UARC, ASL, BIN-RDI, and related research programs, but also UCSC's innovative educational partnerships in Silicon Valley. To educate the workforce of the future by improving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education at all levels, UCSC is partnering with San Jose State University and Foothill-De Anza community colleges to form the Collaborative for Higher Education and address educational issues on several fronts. Programs include the Collaborative Teacher Institute, providing professional development in science and math for elementary school teachers, and the High School STEM Enrichment project, attracting qualified underrepresented youth from Silicon Valley into careers in engineering and science.</p><p>In addition to his extensive leadership and administrative experience, Miller is an accomplished astronomer. His research interests include quasars and active galactic nuclei, focusing on their relationships with the surrounding environment and the nature of their host galaxies. He has also led a number of innovative instrumentation projects involving advanced optical designs and detectors for the Lick and Keck Observatories.</p><p>Miller was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1994 and served as founding chair of the AURA Coordinating Council of Observatory Research Directors from 1997 to 1999. He received the Outstanding Faculty Award for the 1996-97 academic year from the Division of Natural Sciences (now Physical and Biological Sciences).  </p><p>In October 2006, Miller received UC Berkeley's highest honor, the Berkeley Medal, as well as the UC President's Citation of Excellence for his many years contributing to the fulfillment of the UC Mission of teaching, research, and service. Previous recipients of the Berkeley Medal include Herman Wouk, Francois Mitterrand, Glenn Seaborg, Gordon Moore, and President Bill Clinton.</p><p>Miller earned his B.A. in astronomy and physics from UCLA and his M.S. and Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of Wisconsin. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91544f168072704601a012ff43d7b1f3"><name>1790</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation commits $200 million support for Thirty-Meter Telescope</title><summary>The University of California and the California Institute of Technology have received a $200 million commitment over nine years from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation toward the further development and construction of the Thirty-Meter Telescope (TMT).</summary><author>Chris Harrington (202) 974-6314; chris.harrington@ucdc.edu</author><keywords>Thirty-meter Telescope, TMT</keywords><description>The University of California and the California Institute of Technology have received a $200 million commitment over nine years from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation toward the further development and construction of the Thirty-Meter Telescope (TMT).</description><start-date>1196838000000</start-date><display-name>Gordon and Betty Moore...</display-name><path>/2007/12/1790</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/12/1790</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338475742</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338475742</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Chris Harrington</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(202) 974-6314</phone><email>chris.harrington@ucdc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California and the California Institute of Technology have received a $200 million commitment over nine years from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation toward the further development and construction of the Thirty-Meter Telescope (TMT).

The telescope design is being developed by a U.S.-Canadian team that includes the University of California, the California Institute of Technology, and the Association of Canadian Universities for Research in Astronomy (ACURA), with completion of the design development expected by March 2009. <br/>
<br/>
<p>"This is a tremendous investment by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation in a path-breaking scientific tool with great potential for unlocking new insights about the nature of the universe," said UC President Robert C. Dynes. "UC and Caltech are pleased that the Foundation has recognized the tremendous research capacity of our institutions, and we look forward to the exciting findings that this telescope will deliver in the future."</p>
<p>With the TMT, astronomers will be able to locate and analyze the light from the first stellar systems born soon after the Big Bang, determine the physical processes governing the formation and evolution of galaxies like our own Milky Way, study planet formation around nearby stars, and make observations that test the fundamental laws of physics. However, it is the unexpected discoveries that TMT will make that will likely be the most exciting.</p>
<p>"The impressive scope of this project has now been matched by the extraordinary generosity from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. Caltech and the UC System are thrilled with the foundation's confidence in the project, and we and our partners are eager to create a history-making tool that will allow us to see farther into the universe than ever before," said Caltech President Jean-Lou Chameau.</p>
<p>TMT will consist of a primary mirror with 492 individual 1.45-meter segments that together measure 30 meters in diameter, providing more than eight times the collecting area of the current largest telescope. All segments will be under precision computer control so that they will work together as a single mirror. This revolutionary technology was developed for the 10-meter mirrors in the two Keck telescopes in Hawaii.</p>
<p>The TMT will not only be the largest optical-infrared telescope in the world, but it will also be at the forefront of technology in virtually every aspect of its design. Adaptive optics (AO) will allow the TMT to achieve a resolution superior to that of the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p>The TMT AO system will use six laser beams to create six luminous spots in a layer of sodium atoms high in Earth's upper atmosphere. These bright artificial stars serve as references for measuring the turbulence in the atmosphere, allowing the AO system to compensate for blurring of starlight by Earth's fluctuating atmosphere. This technology was pioneered at the Lick Observatory 3-meter telescope and has been developed further at the Palomar 5-meter and Keck 10-meter telescopes.</p>
<p>TMT is a collaboration between Caltech, UC, and ACURA, with significant work being done by industry and by university teams studying instrument designs. The project office is in Pasadena, California.</p>
<p>The Foundation has already granted $50 million in support of a $79 million design-development phase that has been under way since April 2004. ACURA and the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy also contributed to the design-development phase.</p>

<p>But these weren't marine biologists studying sea life. They were volunteers for Grounds Services' Site Stewardship program, and they were keeping their feet planted firmly on land. Their purpose: to dig out invasive plants from an earthen berm at the location and restore native species.</p>
<p>The program, started in 1995, consists of two university staffers who devote part of their hours to it, a few student interns and "a lot of volunteers," said Dave Roe, assistant superintendent of grounds. Roe spends about 20 percent of his time at work with Site Stewardship.</p>

The program's mission?<br/>
<br/>
<p>"We take on ecological restoration and guardianship of campus land," said Roe.</p>
<p>That includes Long Marine Lab and areas surrounding university offices at 2300 Delaware Ave., in addition to the 2,000-acre campus, according to Dean Raven, senior superintendent at Physical Plant.</p>
<p>The program's projects have been aimed at mitigating and restoring some of the degraded natural areas affected by campus activities, said Roe.</p>
<p>For example, students searching for a shortcut from College Nine's Namaste Lounge to Bay Tree Plaza have carved out an ad hoc pathway through Jordan Gulch, trampling the vegetation and causing erosion, said Roe.</p>
<p>Site Stewardship has restored the trail, but they're trying to eliminate it as a trail altogether, because, said Roe, "if we ever get any rains it creates a lot of sediment runoff, and with the Clean Water Act, we're very concerned with maintaining proper storm water management practices. Which, for us, means no erosion."</p>
<p>They've fenced the trail off and posted signs saying students should take the paved road that goes up to College 9 and Social Science 1. As a way to make staying on walkways easier, they're looking into an additional crosswalk so students don't have to walk down to Chinquapin Road.</p>
<p>"We keep the students in mind as to why they're doing it and try to help them," said Roe.</p>
<p>Similarly, in Cowell Meadow above East Field, lots of ad hoc pathways developed as a result of Stevenson infill being built up, according to Roe. This was causing erosion. So, "last year we put in temporary fencing and signage and restored paths with different erosion-control techniques," he said.</p>
<p>They left some paths with erosive-deterrent armoring such as mulch, fiber roles, and jute netting so students could use some parts of the original paths, said Roe.</p>
<p>Much of the on-site work is coordinated by Bill Reid, Site Stewardship coordinator, who spends half his hours on the program and the other half working with grounds maintenance. This quarter, the program had four interns who worked with Reid weekly on projects including data collection, research, mapping, propagating native plants in campus greenhouses, weeding, planting, and outreach to other students.</p>
<p>Restoration projects are ongoing at the upper Jordan Gulch trail between the fire station and Social Sciences to reduce potential for erosion and at Long Marine Lab earthen berm, where exotic, invasive weeds are being replaced with some colorful native coastal species. The group also does meadow monitoring to measure vegetation growth and remaining thatch to provide data for managing the cattle grazing rotations and grassland mowing for fire control purposes.</p>
<p>The program also partners with the <a href="http://ucreserve.ucsc.edu/UCSCCNR/default.html">Campus Natural Reserve</a> to coordinate volunteer work days, including areas on upper campus in the Natural Reserve and at Younger Lagoon next to Long Marine Lab.</p>
<p>The Site Stewardship program was started by Dean Fitch, now senior planner with Physical Planning and Construction. It was patterned after the management plan used by the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which hugs the California coastline for nearly 60 miles in and around San Francisco and is one of the world's largest urban national parks. The GGNRA's stewardship incorporates community volunteerism and internships.</p>
<p>"There's never enough funding, including at Golden Gate, to take care of all the land, so one of the responses from management is to involve the community," said Raven.</p>
<p>Site Stewardship typically gets about 15 volunteers at the two or three work days it holds per quarter, said Roe. Most volunteers are students, but staff, faculty, and community members also have pitched in.</p>
<p>"A key component to the program's success is outreach to the campus community," said Roe.</p>
<p>Going forward, plans are to continue with the ongoing projects and step up invasive weed control this winter, said Roe.</p>
<p>"We see a lot of areas [in need of weed control], so much it's overwhelming," he said.</p>
<p>The first volunteer day next quarter will be Saturday, Jan. 26. The next two are joint work days with the Campus Natural Reserve on Sunday, Feb. 3, and Saturday, March 1.</p>

But her old stomping grounds, the Santa Cruz Mountains, kept calling her back.</p><p>"I have a strong sense of place and I really identify with the area here," said the 28-year-old graduate of Los Gatos High School. </p><p>Now a graduate student in ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, Barber said she was happy to come back. "I'm a total plant junkie and I love California's plant life--the redwoods, the chaparral, the desert wildflowers," she said.</p><p>Because she's also a self-described math geek, Barber decided to explore a relatively new area of plant ecology that uses computer models to understand plant populations. At UCSC, she found a terrific advisor: Daniel Doak, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. And she found the perfect species to study: bristlecone pines, the oldest living things on the planet. </p><p>"As a fluke, before grad school, I took a road trip to the White Mountains to see the bristlecone pines," explains Barber. "I just fell in love with them."   </p><p>Bristlecone pines live as long as 4,000 years, and because of their dense and resinous wood they remain standing thousands of years after they die. These trees offer ecologists a rare window on populations from many climatic periods of the past.  </p><p>Barber joined Doak's lab in 2004 and began trekking to the UC White Mountain Research Station to collect field data. Back in Santa Cruz, she started developing mathematical models to study how bristlecone pine populations have adapted to environmental change in the past. Ultimately, the research could lead to predictions about how global warming might affect the trees in the future.  </p><p>According to Doak, studies of this kind require an expanded sense of time. "What's unique about Adelia's mind is that she's able to think on very long time scales--a skill that very few of us have," he said.</p><p>Yet Barber hasn't let her focus on ancient trees and vast stretches of time slow her down, Doak adds. She still responds quickly to immediate issues. And that's why a funny thing happened on the way to Barber's Ph.D. dissertation. </p><p> </p><p>Back home in her beloved Santa Cruz Mountains, Barber met some residents who were angry about a proposal to log on acreage owned by the San Jose Water Company. She was familiar with the territory--watershed land that provided one-quarter of the drinking water for Silicon Valley. The 7,000-acre property had been off-limits to the public for 100 years and boasted many plants and animals not common elsewhere. It also remained relatively free of invasive species and of the disease called sudden oak death, making it "quite pristine for this area," she said. </p><p>Barber agreed with the local community that this particular land should be reserved for open space and watershed recharge. What really bothered her, though, was that the company had applied for a permit that would allow Big Creek Lumber to harvest trees every 10 years "in perpetuity," without regular review. </p><p>Under state law, that kind of permit was reserved for landowners with less than 2,500 acres of timberland--defined roughly in legal terms as land that contains redwood and Douglas fir trees. The company claimed to have only 2,002 acres of timberland. But that number was not backed up with any data or explanation of how it was calculated.  </p><p>"That was totally inadequate," recalls Barber. "It was a scientific question and they should have said which criteria they used, because there are many ways you could map it."</p><p>Although it took time away from her dissertation, Barber jumped at the chance to volunteer to be a scientific consultant for the grassroots group Neighbors Against Irresponsible Logging (NAIL). The group decided to find out just how much timberland really was on the San Jose Water Company's property. She joined forces with volunteers Rebecca Moore, an engineer who worked at Google, and Jody Frediani, a forestry expert. </p><p>The NAIL volunteers were able to get high-resolution aerial photographs, taken from a helicopter, of each acre of the property. Using Google Earth software, Barber scrutinized the photos, identified the redwoods and Douglas firs, and tallied the acreage.  She found 2,733 acres of timberland--233 acres more than the law allowed for that kind of logging permit. That was a conservative estimate, she said.</p><p>"To eliminate questions regarding interpretation, I chose to use the simplest, most conservative and non-controversial criteria for this determination of 'timberland,'" she wrote in a letter to the California Department of Forestry (CDF).</p><p>Barber described her methodology to the state agency in a 133-page report, which she compiled and then posted on a public web site.</p><p>"Our biggest concern at NAIL was that they'd think we were a rag-tag bunch of Santa Cruz environmentalists and then they'd try to discredit our evidence," Barber says. "So I put up the data for everyone to see."</p><p>The war of numbers heated up. Big Creek Lumber remapped the area and reported that the property contained just less than 2,500 acres of timberland. But the company still didn't fully explain its methodology, according to Barber. Then the CDF flew over the property and made its own determination: the timberland totaled at least 2,800 acres. </p><p>Barber's analysis was vindicated. In October, the CDF announced that it was denying the logging permit.</p><p>"We were so happy, and really impressed that CDF came up with a truthful estimate," Barber recalled.</p><p> </p><p>But the battle isn't over just yet. The San Jose Water Company has requested an appeal before the State Board of Forestry. Barber and her colleagues at NAIL will present her data at the hearing, which is to be held in Sacramento this winter. </p><p>Barber is still a couple years away from completing her dissertation, but the delay was well worth it, she said.  Working on the logging battle taught her an invaluable lesson.</p><p>"I've been involved in conservation before, but I never saw anything like this happen, where it was done so effectively," she said. "We weren't doing tree-sits and holding protests. We were sitting at our computers and slaving away--and it worked."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9154544d8072704601a012ff17deb64e"><name>1793</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Ink, but not toner, cartridges recyclable on campus</title><start-date>1197010800000</start-date><display-name>Ink, but not toner,...</display-name><path>/2007/12/1793</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/12/1793</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338477086</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338477086</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Conscientiously recycling depleted cartridges from office equipment such as laser printers is laudable, but the cartridge recycling program on campus sometimes gets too much of a good thing.</p>
<p>The program takes inkjet or laser jet cartridges, but it cannot recycle toner cartridges, according to Marie Waltrip, financial specialist for Residential, Family &amp; Early Education Services.</p>
<p>There are two cartridge drop-off locations on campus: Family Student Housing, 599 Koshland Way, and the campus Mail Services, located at the loading dock of the Baskin Engineering Building.</p>
<p>At Early Education Services, student assistant Laura Shelley boxes up the cartridges, and they're shipped to a recycling firm.</p>
<p>In addition to being environmentally smart, Early Education Services uses the program as a fundraiser. The recycling company gives the organization a percentage of the recycling income based on volume.</p>
<p>"These funds benefit the children of our faculty, staff, and students who participate in the program," said Waltrip.</p>
<p>Last year, the child care center made $1,224.80 by recycling cartridges, she said.</p>

Yet in 1930 a tsunami of similar size, generated by an earthquake near the Ninigo Islands, struck northern Papua New Guinea and killed just 0.1 to 1 percent of the population on the coast there.</p>
<p>Why were these islanders living earlier in the century better protected? According to tsunami expert Simon Day, they had heard stories passed down from their elders about how to recognize a tsunami and how to respond. These people knew that when they saw the sea draw down, it was time to run for the hills.</p>
<p>"Oral traditions are a very efficient means of tsunami education," said Day, a visiting research associate in Earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Day made this discovery as he and his colleagues searched an area around the Bismarck Sea (north of Papua New Guinea) for past evidence of giant tsunami waves--in particular, for large rocks that were swept to high ground. As he and his colleagues visited villages and asked local leaders for permission to explore the land, the scientists heard and collected stories about past tsunamis. The stories, it turned out, could be linked to several specific geologic events that earlier generations had learned from.</p>
<p>"It became apparent that oral traditions were going back 500 years," Day explained. "The stories contained information about how to recognize when a tsunami was about to come, such as falling sea levels, and told how people should take action. That's the reason why casualties [in 1930] were so low."</p>
<p>In contrast, Day found from a review of the literature, casualties from other tsunamis are much higher in areas inhabited by recent immigrants with no indigenous knowledge about these events. For example, video evidence showed that many people in Thailand in 2004 did not recognize the warning signs of a tsunami and did not realize that there was a safe place to go less than one kilometer away.</p>
<p>"Essentially, a lack of education caused an awful lot of mortality there," he noted.</p>

<p>Day presented these findings on December 11 at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. His talk was entitled "Tsunami Hazard Awareness from Past Experience and the Differing Vulnerability of Indigenous and Coastal Populations."</p>
<p>Near Madang in Papua New Guinea, Day heard stories about two unusual events: a big earthquake that had caused the land to rise and the sea never to return, and a huge tsunami. Using carbon-14 dating on dead coral reefs now sitting on dry land, Day and his colleagues found physical evidence that such an uplifting caused by an earthquake had indeed occurred around 1450 AD. And a large tsunami struck the islands around 1500 AD.</p>
<p>He also met some very old residents who knew these stories and described the 1930 tsunami that had sent them scrambling to the hills. Rock deposits suggested that seawater levels had run up several meters. That tsunami was bigger than previously thought, similar in intensity to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami as it struck Thailand.</p>
<p>Day's studies suggest that preparatory education and self-warning are critical for surviving a massive tsunami.</p>
<p>"The upshot is, if we could reproduce this level of awareness that some people get from traditional stories, it would serve as a very effective way to mitigate the effects of tsunamis, and it could be transmitted over many generations," he concluded.</p>
<p>Interestingly, oral traditions can serve this purpose even if not accurate scientifically.</p>
<p>"In Papua New Guinea, there's no such thing as a natural disaster--it's always blamed on sorcery by a rival tribe," Day explained. "In some places there, an earthquake is considered to be a byproduct of the spell that a sorcerer uses to cause a tsunami--the two events are related. But most important, the stories explain what to do, so they're useful."</p>
<p>According to Day, a modern tsunami education program could be modeled after one developed to prepare at-risk populations for volcanic eruptions and mudslides. Known as "Education for Self-Warning and Voluntary Evacuation" (ESWAVE), the program was created by volcanologists after the 1985 Armero eruption in Colombia. That disaster killed 20,000 people, who were swamped by floods, ash, and debris because they did not understand the significance of the warnings that were given.</p>
<p>In 1991, volcanologists used extensive education campaigns to prepare people--including personnel at a U.S. Air Force base--for the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. Film footage from earlier volcano disasters helped bring the message home. Now, video clips of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami are available and these could also be used in a similar education program, Day said.</p>
<p>"The tsunami research community needs to learn some lessons from the volcanologists in order to better mitigate the hazards," Day noted. "If recent film footage were used in the right way, it could be a very effective way to educate people about tsunami hazards."</p>
<p>To save lives, populations at risk should be educated first, even before governments worry about setting up regional tsunami warning systems, he said.</p>

<p>The SEA program will expand the number of undergraduate college students exposed to investigative research. Beginning in the fall of 2008, UCSC and 11 other participating institutions will offer undergraduates an innovative course in phage genomics that involves conducting experiments in the field and the laboratory. Students in the course will also join the national SEA research network, allowing them to share data and collaborate with each other, much as professional research scientists do.</p>
<p>"This will give students a chance to get hands-on experience connecting them to the process of discovery, and to go beyond just learning factoids from books," said Manuel Ares, professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology at UCSC. Ares will be trained by HHMI to teach the course, along with Grant Hartzog, associate professor of MCD biology.</p>
<p>The Phage Genomics course offered by the 12 SEA member schools will be modeled after a pilot project that was developed and taught this year by Graham F. Hatfull, an HHMI professor at the University of Pittsburgh. Students go out into the field, collect microbes, and then isolate bacteriophages--viruses that infect bacteria. In the lab, each student studies one phage that he or she finds, isolates its DNA, clones it, and then sequences its genome. When the SEA network is established this fall, students will be able to compare their own phage's genome with others being studied.</p>
<p>The program will offer undergraduates a rare opportunity, early in their studies, to contribute to real scientific discoveries. Although phages are plentiful and easy to study, little is known about their diversity in the wild. The UCSC students will be encouraged to explore and sample a wide variety of microenvironments, such as canopies of redwoods, mountain caves, and tide pools of the Pacific Ocean. Every student will likely find and name a new phage species previously unknown to science, Ares said. Students will also have their data reviewed by peers, and their findings may be published in professional journals.</p>
<p>Ares and Hartzog plan to offer "Phage Genomics" as a 2-unit course that must be taken every quarter in the fall, winter, and spring. Only 15 to 20 students will be selected to participate. Freshmen with AP credit in biology will be encouraged to apply, according to Ares. The course will satisfy university requirements for laboratory science, but will offer more than just lab techniques.</p>
<p>"Students who have run gels and columns and have sequenced DNA will gain a sense of the art of interpretation of data," said Hartzog. "It's something special that students will get out of this course."</p>
<p>According to Ares, the new SEA program will benefit not only UCSC students, but also faculty. If assessments show that the new course has broad impact on students' success, as he expects, the SEA program could help kindle a revolution in teaching, he said.</p>
<p>Faculty should find it energizing to work with top-notch students and rewarding to help undergraduates stay engaged in science, Ares said. Eventually, he envisions involving professors from multiple departments, such as environmental toxicology and chemistry.</p>
<p>"I'm hoping that this course will be instituted as a permanent part of our curriculum and that different faculty will be rotated through it," said Ares. "Then faculty will be reinvigorated and will bring new excitement to their teaching."</p>
<p>Ares has been involved in other HHMI efforts to improve undergraduate science education. As an HHMI professor, he received a $1 million grant that enabled him to run a special undergraduate research lab for four years. (See earlier stories about <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=202">the grant</a> and the <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1698">achievements of students</a> in the Ares lab.)</p>
<p>HHMI is offering three years of support to all SEA institutions. The funding will cover expenses for the training of faculty, course materials, laboratory reagents, computing and software support, and an Internet-based networking infrastructure.</p>

<p>Moore took part in an eight-week scientific drilling expedition off the Pacific Coast of Japan, as part of the launch of the Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE), an international research initiative supported by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP).</p>
<p>"What we're trying to understand is the earthquake cycle--what makes these faults move, when they do," said Moore, who was involved in the conceptual planning of the experiment. "Right now the fault is locked, the rubber band is stretching, and it's going to break probably in the next 50 years. We want to know what brings it to that breaking point."</p>
<p>Unlike previous ocean drilling projects that explored basic plate tectonics, NanTroSEIZE specifically aims to understand the triggers and mechanisms that lead to earthquakes and tsunamis. NanTroSEIZE will also attempt the deepest ever drilling penetration in a seismogenic fault zone, conducting both sampling of the rocks and monitoring of the seismic cycle there. The drilling site, an area called the Nankai Trough, is located off the coast of Shingu, Japan--a sister city of Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The Nankai Trough marks the boundary between two of Earth's major crustal plates, where the Philippines Sea plate rams into and slides under the Eurasian plate. Centuries of Japanese records suggest that this subduction zone has generated many large earthquakes, including one of magnitude 8.1 in 1944 and another of magnitude 8.3 in 1946.</p>
<p>According to Moore, the combination of a thrust fault and an off-branching splay fault at this location creates the potential for a huge and sudden uplift of the seafloor--on the order of 10 to 20 meters. Such a disturbance can lead to a giant tsunami wave, similar to the one that struck the Indian Ocean region on December 26, 2004.</p>
<p>"A subduction zone like the Nankai Trough can generate the world's biggest and most damaging earthquakes and tsunamis, so there's good reason to drill there," Moore said.</p>
<p>Researchers working with NanTroSEIZE will be the first to drill deeply in this type of seismic hotbed, Moore said. A different type of seismogenic zone is being explored on land by U.S. Geological Survey researchers who have drilled into California's San Andreas Fault, a strike-slip boundary where two plates slide past each other.</p>
<p>As part of NanTroSEIZE Expedition 314, Moore worked aboard the world's largest research drilling vessel, Chikyu Hakken (Japanese for "Earth Discovery"). The new vessel and its crew left Shingu Port on September 21. Moore helicoptered off the ship on November 16, but the Chikyu will continue this drilling program into February 2008 with other scientists on board.</p>
<p>In this part of the experiment's first phase, 16 onboard scientists from six countries conducted logging-while-drilling operations at five sites. They drilled between 400 and 1,400 meters below the seabed and logged data on the physical properties of the rocks and sediments that have piled up at the fault zone to form an undersea mountain range.</p>
<p>Moore measured the stresses pressing in on the boreholes by collecting images and analyzing the boreholes' failure patterns. His goal was to figure out how the strain is distributed and how the faults are oriented.</p>
<p>"The most exciting thing was getting an unprecedented record of the stress accumulating between major earthquakes in a subduction zone," Moore said. "From the failure patterns, we can determine the orientation of the stress. We have the directions nailed right now."</p>
<p>Findings from Expedition 314 were presented at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, where Moore participated in a news conference on December 12 entitled, "Undersea drilling reveals mechanics of earthquakes, tsunamis." The panel discussion was led by Harold Tobin, co-chief scientist of the expedition. Tobin is a geologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and an alumnus of UCSC.</p>
<p>Ultimately, NanTroSEIZE is expected to give researchers access to the "seismogenic zone," where earthquakes are generated. To do this, the experiment will proceed in four phases through 2012, eventually drilling through the crust and into the Earth's mantle at a depth of 6 kilometers.</p>
<p>"It's a learning process," Moore noted. "We have to take small steps because it's a hostile environment that's difficult to work in. When we get to 6 kilometers the challenges will be huge."</p>
<p>In 2009, Moore is slated to serve as co-chief scientist of an expedition, sharing duties with a researcher from the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), a leading research institution in Japan. By then, the team expects to begin using a technique called riser drilling to probe the mega-splay fault zone at 3,500 meters below the seafloor, he said.</p>
<p>At that point, Moore said, he looks forward to making another set of measurements that have never been collected before. "More than anything, we'd like to know what the variation of water pressure in that fault zone is," he explained. "That's critical because fluids push the two plates apart and can also allow the faults to slip."</p>

<p>In the final phase of the drilling experiment, researchers plan to install observatories--sets of instruments deep in the seismogenic zone that will allow them to monitor changes. The scientists hope to identify precursors that signal when a major earthquake is about to happen.</p>

"We are very excited about the approval of the Institute of Marine Sciences' plan, which will allow the institute to fully realize its potential for research, education, and public outreach related to the coastline and adjacent waters," said UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal. "This plan reflects our commitment to a sustainable, innovative, and accessible research and education facility, and it will guide our preservation of this special environment."<br/>
<br/>
<p>Chancellor Blumenthal promoted the plan at the commission hearing.</p>
<p>The 100-acre site currently has research and education facilities on 16 acres, including Long Marine Lab, the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, and research laboratories of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG). The CLRDP for the "Marine Science Campus" allows for the development of an additional 12 acres for new research and education facilities, setting aside 72 acres of the site for environmental restoration and preservation.</p>
<p>"This plan allows the marine science campus to reach its full potential as a center for research, education, and outreach, where faculty, students, and the public can interact and participate in a comprehensive marine science program," said Gary Griggs, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at UCSC.</p>
<p>The CLRDP is the result of an eight-year process in which the campus engaged with the Coastal Commission, the City of Santa Cruz and other governmental agencies, third-party experts, and community residents. It protects all Coastal Act wetlands as confirmed by peer reviewers from the Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and Coastal Commission biologists. The CLRDP includes clustered development zones to reduce impact, increases public education and public coastal access, and promotes collaborative research among leading local and national marine scientists and agencies.</p>
<p>For more than 40 years, UCSC has educated and trained champions of environmental protection and leaders in the field of marine sciences. The campus is at the forefront of efforts to study the California coast, home to one of the world's most diverse marine environments. The CLRDP enables UCSC's marine science center to continue its development as a model of integrated research and public education activities, facilitating the creation of informed policies and science-based solutions to address the complex environmental challenges facing California's coastline, oceans, and marine life.</p>
<p>"Sound coastal planning depends on sound science. UCSC has and will continue to make significant contributions to our understanding of the marine and coastal environment, with implications for how we manage those resources," said Griggs.</p>
<p>UCSC faculty, staff, students, and research partners are actively pursuing important areas of marine research, including coastal ecology, conservation biology, environmental toxicology, coastal processes, and climate change. Other research groups currently based at the marine science campus include the National Marine Fisheries Service Santa Cruz Laboratory, the Department of Fish and Game Marine Wildlife Veterinary Care and Research Center, the Nature Conservancy's Marine Initiative, the nonprofit group Island Conservation, and the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group.</p>
<p>In a letter to the commission supporting the CLRDP, U.S. Representative Sam Farr wrote: "I believe the plan allows the Marine Lab to expand its critical research and education mission while it maintains the open space and natural beauty of the coastal site."</p>
<p>Julie Packard, executive director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, also expressed support for the CLRDP, writing: "I believe the additional facilities growth requested by UCSC is an essential and appropriate investment in the future of our coastal environment."</p>
<p>Many other influential leaders in coastal research, education, and policy in California expressed their support for the CLRDP, including Leon Panetta, co-chair of the Joint Oceans Institute; Fred Keeley, Santa Cruz County treasurer and former state assemblymember; Bill Douros, West Coast Marine Sanctuary regional manager; Churchill Grimes, National Marine Fisheries Service Laboratory director; Dan Haifley, executive director of the O'Neill Sea Odyssey Program; Kenneth Coale, director of Moss Landing Marine Laboratories; Sam Johnson, chief scientist of the USGS Coastal and Marine Team; Marcia McNutt, president of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute; and George Somero, director of Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station.</p>
<p>Marine research and education facilities account for about 80 percent of the new building space in the plan (254,000 out of 322,000 square feet). The rest consists of support facilities such as a centralized warehouse for equipment storage and maintenance, and short-term accommodations for visiting researchers. The plan also includes outdoor research areas with new marine mammal pools, and provides for potential expansion of the lab's seawater system.</p>
<p>Griggs noted that the timeline for the developments approved in the CLRDP is uncertain, but will probably extend over many years. "It took us 30 years to get this far, so it's a long and gradual process. But this opens the door for us to reach that potential," he said.</p>
<p>Because the plan as approved by the Coastal Commission includes modifications suggested by the commission and its staff, the CLRDP must still be approved by the UC Regents, after which it can receive final certification from the Coastal Commission.</p>

This is very exciting news for our faculty, staff, and students-and for our campus, which for decades has contributed to the field of marine sciences through the educational and research activities at Long Marine Laboratory.</p><p>Creating the potential for expansion of those activities is a very positive development for the Santa Cruz community and Central Coast region. The people who live and work in this part of the state have an obvious interest in research and education that adds to our understanding of the coastline and guides the preservation of this special environment.</p><p>I want to express my sincere thanks to the members of the Coastal Commission and their staff, whose collaborative discussions with our campus representatives over many years produced a plan that expands public access to that area and lays the foundation for restoring more than 70 percent of the 100-acre site to its native condition.</p><p>Many people on campus also deserve our thanks. Institute of Marine Sciences director Gary Griggs and Long Marine Lab staff have championed this plan since the CLRDP process began almost a decade ago. Vice Chancellor Tom Vani and his planning staff also deserve our appreciation for all that they have accomplished on this project.</p><p>And finally, I would like to thank the many off-campus people whose support of our plan was crucial to its passage. These people include U.S. Representative Sam Farr and Monterey Bay Aquarium executive director (and UCSC alumna) Julie Packard. And they include Santa Cruz County Treasurer (and former Assemblymember) Fred Keeley, who supported the plan at today's hearing in San Francisco.</p><p>In light of today's Coastal Commission approval, I invite you to read more about our Coastal LRDP through a press release that our Public Information Office is distributing this afternoon: <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1804">press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1804</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9154693b8072704601a012ff755c73ca"><name>1807</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Literature professor Sharon Kinoshita receives MLA prize</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>kinoshita, MLA, language, French, literature</keywords><start-date>1199084400000</start-date><display-name>Literature professor Sharon Kinoshita...</display-name><path>/2007/12/1807</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/12/1807</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338482442</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338482442</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/12/images/sharonkinoshita.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/12/images/sharonkinoshita.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sharonkinoshita.jpg</name><file-size>37794</file-size><width>180</width><height>180</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Sharon Kinoshita</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Literature professor Sharon Kinoshita has received an honorable mention award from The Modern Language Association of America (MLA) as part of its 15th annual Aldo and Jeanne Scaglione Prize for French and Francophone Literary Studies. Kinoshita received the honor for her book, <i>Medieval Boundaries: Rethinking Difference in Old French Literature</i>, published by the University of Pennsylvania Press. </p><p>The prize is awarded annually for an outstanding book in its field--a literary or linguistic study, a critical edition of an important work, or a critical biography. The committee's citation for Kinoshita's book noted:</p><p>"<i>Medieval Boundaries</i> traces the rich vein of cross-cultural negotiation and influence at work in the literature of the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries. Beginning with the simple observation that many of the major works of early French medieval literature situate their action on or beyond the borders of what is now France, Sharon Kinoshita argues brilliantly against the 'clash of civilizations' model for the cultural history of the early Middle Ages.This is an important and beautifully written study whose impact will be felt in the fields of medieval literature, art, history, and culture."</p><p>Kinoshita teaches French and world literature and is codirector of the UCSC Humanities Division's research unit in Mediterranean Studies. She is also co-organizer of a residential research group at the UC Humanities Research Institute in Irvine and an NEH summer institute in Barcelona, Spain. </p><p>Kinoshita received her M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in comparative literature from UC Berkeley. She is the author of numerous articles that have appeared in the <i>Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies</i> and <i>PMLA</i>. She is currently working on two book projects: "The Medieval Culture of Empire: Old French Literature and Beyond" and "Medieval Mediterranean Literature."</p><p>The MLA is the largest and one of the oldest American academic societies in the humanities that promotes the advancement of literary and linguistic studies. Its 30,000 members come from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as from Canada, Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Approximately 9,500 members of the MLA and its allied and affiliate organizations attend the association's annual convention each December. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91546adf8072704601a012ff2d73ab0b"><name>1808</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC faculty receive $4.5 million in new grants for stem cell research</title><summary>Two UCSC faculty members have received major grants totalling $4.5 million for stem cell research from the California Insitute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM).</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>stem cell research, Bin Chen, Camilla Forsberg</keywords><description>Two UCSC faculty members have received major grants totalling $4.5 million for stem cell research from the California Insitute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM).</description><start-date>1197529200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC faculty receive $4.5...</display-name><path>/2007/12/1808</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/12/1808</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338482854</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338482854</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/12/images/chen.forsberg_300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/12/images/chen.forsberg_300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>chen.forsberg_300.jpg</name><file-size>67822</file-size><width>300</width><height>212</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Bin Chen and Camilla Forsberg received CIRM New Faculty Awards for stem cell research.

Stephens</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Two young faculty members at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have received major grants for stem cell research from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM). The five-year grants totalling $4.5 million will support the research of Bin Chen, assistant professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, and Camilla Forsberg, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering. </p><p>The grants are among 22 New Faculty Awards announced yesterday by CIRM to fund stem cell research at various California institutions. UCSC has now received a total of more than $9 million from CIRM to fund the campus's growing stem cell research program.</p><p>"It is really remarkable how successful we've been at getting started in this new area of research," said Stephen Thorsett, dean of physical and biological sciences at UCSC. "Our proposals to CIRM have garnered more funding than those of any other institution that doesn't have a medical school."</p><p>Stem cell research has enormous potential to produce new therapies and cures for a wide range of diseases. Stem cells are unspecialized cells that are able to renew themselves indefinitely and can also differentiate into specialized cell types with specific functions, such as a nerve cell or liver cell. Eventually, stem cells may be used to replace damaged or dysfunctional cells in the body with healthy new ones.</p><p>The latest CIRM grants are intended for scientists in the critical early stages of their careers as independent investigators and faculty members. Designed to encourage and foster the next generation of clinical and scientific leaders in stem cell research, the New Faculty Awards support research across the range of stem cell types--human and animal, adult and embryonic. The work supported by Chen and Forsberg's grants will not involve human embryonic stem cells.</p><p>Forsberg, who joined the faculty of UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering in July, is studying how stem cells make the decision to become a particular type of mature blood cell, and how this process can go wrong to cause disease. She uses special lines of mice genetically engineered to allow her to track the development of mature blood cells from their stem cell progenitors. Forsberg said two of the fundamental challenges in using stem cells to treat diseases are to get the cells established in the body, and then to direct the cells to differentiate into the desired cell type.</p><p>"Our long-term goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of stem cell fate decisions and, ultimately, to be able to manipulate those decisions after transplantation of stem cells into the body," Forsberg said.</p><p>Chen's research focuses on the development of corticospinal motor neurons, which control voluntary muscle movements and are affected in neurodegenerative diseases and spinal cord injuries. Earlier this year, she received one of the first CIRM research grants: $500,000 for research on embryonic stem cells (see <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1086">press release</a>). She also uses mouse models to study how stem cells differentiate into specialized neurons. </p><p>"One of the most exciting possibilities in stem cell biology is the potential to replace damaged or diseased neural tissues affected by neurodegenerative disorders," Chen said. "Neurons derived from stem cells provide a potentially limitless supply for cell replacement, if we could guide stem cells cultured in a laboratory toward specific differentiation pathways to produce specific types of neurons."</p><p>Chen's new grant will provide research funding of $436,000 in the first year and a total of $2.2 million over five years. Forsberg's grant will provide $467,000 in the first year and a total of $2.3 million over five years. Forsberg noted that the awards were the result of a team effort involving a large group of people working to build UCSC's stem cell research program. The interdisciplinary program involves researchers in biology and engineering, as well as contributions from humanities faculty in the area of bioethics.</p><p>"This is team building at its best. I feel very supported by the campus and the engineering school," Forsberg said.</p><p>Other awards UCSC has received from CIRM include a $1.2 million training grant in 2006 and a $2.7 million grant in June 2007 to fund a stem cell research facility, as well as seed grants to start new research projects. </p><p>In the latest round of funding, the following UC campuses received CIRM New Faculty Awards:</p><p>   . UC Berkeley: $2.2 million</p><p>   . UC Davis: $2.4 million</p><p>   . UC Irvine: $2.1 million</p><p>   . UCLA: $7.6 million</p><p>   . UC Merced: $1.6 million</p><p>   . UC Riverside: $2.1 million</p><p>   . UC San Diego: $2.2 million</p><p>   . UC Santa Cruz: $4.5 million</p><p>CIRM was established in 2004 with the passage of Proposition 71, the California Stem Cell Research and Cures Act. The statewide ballot measure, which provided $3 billion in funding for stem cell research at California universities and research institutions, was overwhelmingly approved by voters, and called for the establishment of an entity to make grants and provide loans for stem cell research, research facilities, and other vital research opportunities. The CIRM governing board has now approved almost $260 million for research grants at 22 California institutions.

The loss of genes may also lead to adaptations that help species survive, but this idea has not been well studied. Now, scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have carried out the first systematic computational analysis to identify long-established genes that were lost during the millions of years of evolution leading to the human species. Their findings appear in the December 14 issue of <em>PLoS Computational Biology.</em></p>
<p>"This is the first study designed to search the entire genome for recent loss of genes that do not have any near-duplicate copies elsewhere in the genome. These are likely to be the more important gene losses," said David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering at UCSC.</p>
<p>Haussler and five others in his research group--postdoctoral researcher Jingchun Zhu, graduate students Zack Sanborn and Craig Lowe, technical projects manager Mark Diekhans, and evolutionary biologist Tom Pringle--are coauthors of the paper.</p>
<p>"The idea that gene losses might contribute to adaptation has been kicked around, but not well studied," said Zhu, who is first author of the paper. "We found three examples in the literature, and all of them could have medical implications."</p>
<p>To find gene losses, Zhu employed a software program called TransMap that Diekhans had developed. The program compared the mouse and human genomes, searching for genes having changes significant enough to render them nonfunctional sometime during the 75 million years since the divergence of the mouse and the human lineages.</p>
<p>Genes can be lost in many ways. This study focused on losses caused by mutations that disrupt the DNA sequences known as open reading frames. These are either point mutations, where events such as the insertion or substitution of a DNA base alter the instructions encoded in the DNA, or changes that occur when a large portion of a gene is deleted altogether or moves to a new place on the genome.</p>
<p>Because the dog diverged from our ancient common ancestor earlier than the mouse, the researchers used the dog genome as an "out group" to filter out false positives, Sanborn said. "If a gene is still living in both dog and mouse but not in human, it was probably living in the common ancestor and then lost in the human lineage," he explained.</p>
<p>Using this process, they identified 26 losses of long-established genes, including 16 that were not previously known. The gene-loss candidates found in this study do not represent a complete list of gene losses in the human lineage, however, because the analysis was designed to produce more false negatives than false positives.</p>
<p>Next they compared the identified genes in the complete genomes of the human, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, mouse, rat, dog, and opossum to estimate the evolutionary time when the gene was functional before it was lost. This analysis refined the timing of the gene loss and also served as a benchmark for whether the gene in question was long-established, and therefore probably functional, or merely a redundant gene copy. Through this process, they found six genes that were lost only in the human.</p>
<p>One previously unknown loss, the gene for acyltransferase-3 (ACYL3), particularly caught their attention. Multiple copies of the ACYL3 gene are encoded in the fly and worm genomes.</p>
<p>"This is an ancient protein that exists throughout the whole tree of life," said Zhu. "In the mammalian clade there is only one copy left, and somewhere along primate evolution, that copy was lost."</p>
<p>"In our analysis, we found that this gene contains a nonsense mutation in human and chimp, and it appears to still be functional in rhesus," added Sanborn. The researchers also found that the mutation is not present in the orangutan, so the gene is probably still functional in that species. To further narrow down the timing of the loss, the researchers looked to see if the gene is still active in the gorilla.</p>
<p>"On the evolutionary tree leading to human, on the branch between chimp and orangutan, sits gorilla," Sanborn explained.</p>
<p>After sequencing the corresponding region in a DNA sample from a gorilla, he found the gene intact, without the mutation, meaning the loss likely occurred in the primate lineage after the speciation of the gorilla and before that of the chimpanzee.</p>
<p>In addition to ACYL3, the researchers identified other genes that were lost in humans and did not have any "functional homologues," or alternate genes that could perform the same function, in the human genome. The researchers called these "orphan losses."</p>
<p>"A highlight of our research was that we were able to find a list of these orphan losses," said Zhu. "Some of them have been functional for more than 300 million years, and they were the last copies left in the human genome."</p>
<p>While the copies of these genes remaining in the human genome appear to be nonfunctional, functional copies of all of them exist in the mouse genome.</p>
<p>"These orphan genes may be interesting candidates for experimental biologists to explore," said Zhu. "It would be interesting to find out what was the biological effect of these losses. Once their function is well characterized in species that still have active copies, we could maybe speculate about their effects on human evolution."</p>
<p>This research was funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute, the National Institutes of Health, the National Cancer Institute, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.</p>

Williams</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>No human can survive longer than a few minutes underwater, and even a well-trained Olympic swimmer needs frequent gulps of air. Our brains need a constant supply of oxygen, particularly during exercise.</p>
<p>Contrast that with Weddell seals, animals that dive and hunt under the Antarctic sea ice. They hold their breath for as long as 90 minutes, and remain active and mentally alert the whole time. The seals aren't fazed at all by low levels of oxygen that would cause humans to black out. What's their secret?</p>
<p>Certain animals--including dolphins, whales and sea otters--appear to be protected by elevated levels of oxygen-carrying proteins in their brains, according to a study by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, led by Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. The team measured and compared the amounts of these complex oxygen-carrying proteins--called globins--in the cerebral cortex of 16 different mammalian species. The results suggest that some species have evolved the capacity to protect their brains from conditions of low oxygen, also called hypoxia.</p>
<p>"What was remarkable was the level of variability we found," said Williams. "Some animals had three to 10 times more neuroprotecting type globins than others. These wild species may hold many clues about how to turn on protective mechanisms in the mammalian brain."</p>
<p>The discovery could have important implications for understanding stroke and aging in humans, according to Williams. It's not yet clear whether animals of a particular species are born with high amounts of brain globins, or whether their behavior and environment stimulate the production of globins. But in either case, the amounts appear to be malleable. That's promising, she said, because if globin production could be boosted in humans, then brain damage due to disease or aging could potentially be minimized.</p>
<p>"The mammalian brain appears to have a remarkable capacity for increasing neuroprotective globins--we're seeing that in a comparative way in animals," Williams explained. "Could we take advantage of that? Could we retrain the human brain to improve our own survival? We don't know yet, but it's certainly intriguing and worth investigating."</p>
<p>The study appears online December 18th in the <em>Proceedings of The Royal Society B.</em> Williams is lead author of the paper, entitled "Running, swimming and diving modifies neuroprotecting globins in the mammalian brain."</p>
<p>Scientists have long wondered why marine mammals are so tolerant of hypoxia. The conventional wisdom was that they had evolved physiological adaptations that increased the delivery of oxygen to the brain--for example, higher capillary density and blood flow that could be shunted preferentially to the brain. But despite such adaptations, blood oxygen levels still plummet after just a few minutes underwater, according to recent studies by Williams's group and others. How marine mammals could keep their vital organs alive on such low levels of oxygen remained a mystery.</p>
<p>Some unknown factor seemed to be involved, and Williams's attention recently turned to new types of globins that were discovered in 2000. Called neuroglobins and cytoglobins, these oxygen-carrying proteins reside in the brain tissue. That distinguishes them from hemoglobin, a similar iron-containing protein complex that carries oxygen in the blood and circulates throughout the body. Another molecular relative, myoglobin, facilitates oxygen delivery only in muscle tissue.</p>
<p>Scientists are still investigating the physical chemistry of these brain globins. So far, the evidence suggests that cytoglobins could play a role in efficiently moving oxygen out of the blood and into the brain, even when oxygen levels are extremely low, Williams said. The brain's neuroglobins, on the other hand, appear to be able to grab reactive oxygen and prevent the formation of destructive free radicals. Together, she said, these two resident neuroglobins could help keep the brain functioning and well-protected against damage during hypoxia.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, Williams brought together a team that included molecular biologists, biochemists, and wildlife veterinarians. The researchers wanted to find out if the amounts and kinds of globins in the brain correlated with the physical activity patterns of various wild mammals. They collected brain tissue from 41 terrestrial mammals and 23 marine mammals representing 15 wild species and one laboratory species. These came from state animal control programs or were "found" animals that had died from roadkill, fisheries bycatch, or stranding.</p>
<p>For each brain sample, the team measured hemoglobin and resident neuroglobins--the neuroglobins and cytoglobins--in the cerebral cortex. In the laboratory of coauthor David Kliger, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC, the researchers used a technique called spectrophotometry to identify and quantify the minute quantities of brain globins that were present at the time of the animal's death.</p>
<p>They found a striking difference in globin levels depending on whether the species was a terrestrial, swimming, or diving specialist, according to Williams. Compared to terrestrial mammals, marine species had higher amounts of hemoglobin--and their brain tissues were darker in color due to an abundance of iron.</p>
<p>But the study results weren't entirely as expected: the shallow-swimming and highly active dolphins, sea lions, and sea otters had higher amounts of resident neuroglobins than did the deep-diving whales. And then there was the bobcat. Unlike the dog-related species--foxes and coyotes--three bobcat individuals had surprisingly high amounts of resident brain globins.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's not just breath-holding that stimulates these globins, but high levels of activity, such as sprinting," Williams said.</p>
<p>The research hasn't completely solved the mystery, but it's a first step, said Mary Zavanelli, a lecturer in molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UCSC. Zavanelli developed the laboratory techniques for measuring the amounts and kinds of globins in brain tissue by analyzing gene expression. In this way, she confirmed the species differences.</p>
<p>"There won't be a quick answer because this is complicated biology," said Zavanelli. "But the techniques are straightforward and simple, so it's just a matter of focusing on our questions. The big problem is getting enough brain tissue that's in good shape, especially from found wild animals."</p>
<p>As this research project continues, it might expand to include an investigation of whether high levels of brain globins are correlated with long lifespans in certain species. Bowhead whales have been known to live as long as 211 years, Williams noted. That makes her wonder how their brains are protected and whether whales ever suffer from strokes.</p>
<p>"These animals may have solved the aging brain problem," she noted. "Neuroglobins might give us some clues as to how."</p>
<p>Other UCSC researchers involved in the study included graduate student Lucas Cantin and staff researcher Robert Goldbeck in Kliger's lab; campus veterinarian David Casper; and undergraduate Michael Morledge in Zavanelli's lab. The study's coauthors also include Melissa Miller of the California Department of Fish and Game's Marine Wildlife Veterinary Care and Research Center, and Ann Pabst and William McLellan of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington.</p>

She works with Lindsay Hinck, associate professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, whose research includes investigations of mammary gland development. The mouse "Slit" genes have a homologue in humans that is less active in breast cancer cells than in normal cells, and PeBenito is investigating the function of the proteins made by Slit genes. Her poster was entitled, "SLITS function as tumor suppressors in mouse mammary gland."</p><p>"It has really been her project and that allowed her to speak well about it," said Hinck. "Milana has put in a lot of time and effort. She's a fabulous researcher--serious and dedicated."</p><p>PeBenito is a MARC (Minority Access to Research Careers) fellow and she started her laboratory research as a CAMP (California Alliance for Minority Participation) intern.</p><p>ABRCMS is an annual conference organized by the American Society for Microbiology and is supported by a grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. The conference is designed to encourage underrepresented minority students to pursue advanced training in the biomedical and behavioral sciences and to provide faculty mentors and advisors with resources for facilitating students' success.</p><p>During the conference, more than 1,100 students participated in poster and oral presentations in 10 scientific disciplines in the biomedical and behavioral sciences. A total of 84 undergraduates representing 56 universities and colleges around the country received monetary awards of $250 for their outstanding presentations.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91548bdf8072704601a012ffcda1deff"><name>1826</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</summary><keywords>UCSC in the news</keywords><description>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</description><start-date>1198134000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2007/12/1826</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/12/1826</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338491309</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338491309</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</em></p>

"Rafael is a very methodical and strategic leader who will launch the mission of UCCP to the next level, leveraging innovative technologies and the creativity and expertise within the University of California to develop open-access, online, high-quality educational materials that students want to use."   </p><p>UCCP has been housed in UCSC Student Affairs since its inception in 1999 and currently reports to the Enrollment Management Unit. UCCP is also part of a suite of services comprising the UC Office of the President's publishing and strategic initiatives and is funded through the Student Academic Preparation and Educational Partnerships (SAPEP) budget category.</p><p>Granados, who previously served as UCCP's director of educational technology, guided the development of many of UCCP's most popular multimedia high school courses, developed the program's open-access web interface, and created its award-winning CyberTutor program. Granados has served as an instructional designer and educator, and previously directed an Academic Excellence Program at UCSC. In 2006, Granados was selected as a Hispanic Development Corporation Portrait of Success Honoree. Granados is also a UC Santa Cruz alumnus with a master's degree in education and a B.A. in computer science and education.</p><p>UCCP provides a core curriculum of online courses that meet the University of California's "a-g" requirements for admission. Since 1999, it has served over 100,000 California students in 56 California counties by providing online courses, instruction, tutoring, academic preparation, and college planning services. </p><p>Earlier this year, UCCP shifted its focus from being a provider of online instruction of its high school courses back to its origins of creating the finest course content available. The online organization has already posted its 18 UC-developed courses for students and educators to use at no cost through its <a href="http://www.uccp.org">web site</a>. The program plans to develop three to five new courses and recently inaugurated an Advisory Board consisting of expert UC, CSU, and community college faculty and staff, educational technologists, business and industry leaders, and K-12 administrators to oversee and approve its content development.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a2768ee88072704601a012ff3a6735f3"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2007/12/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/12/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282625932936</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282625932936</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a2768ee88072704601a012ff3a6735f3"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2007/12/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/12/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282625932936</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282625932936</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
