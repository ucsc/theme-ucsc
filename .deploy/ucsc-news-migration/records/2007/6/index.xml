"Some of the actors work with the Magic Theatre in San Francisco, and some you may have seen in TV commercials or films from local filmmakers. These are all actors who are willing to devote their time and talents to help students learn."</p><p>V said that her goal in casting professional (rather than student) actors is to give the writers the best possible reading of their work. "It's an opportunity for students to discover things about their writing they may not have previously recognized," said V. "They'll also have the chance to learn just how much an actor can bring to the words on the page."</p><p>UCSC's  Film and Digital Media Department is inaugurating the senior screenplay reading this year as a parallel graduation event to its annual film screening event which takes place later that evening on June 15-from 7:30 p.m. to 11 p.m.--at the Media Theater. That event features a screening of short films created by students in Professor Eli Hollander's Senior Project in Film and Video class, and is also free and open to the public.  </p><p>"In the past, there was no way for the public to learn about student film scripts, and the students had no opportunity to test their writing on an audience," V noted. "Since screenwriting is clearly about writing for an audience, I wanted to include the audience as part of the learning process. This new event affords a give-and-take learning experience."</p><p>Each writer in V's class completed a two-hour movie script--from initial concept and outline to final "Fade Out"--in just 10 weeks. V said the goal is for these students to graduate with a finished creative project that they can show people and use to help market themselves. The public reading will include selections from a variety of genres including comedy, drama, horror, Sci-Fi, and thrillers.</p><p>Earlier this year, two UCSC alumni received honors in the fourth annual American Zoetrope Screenplay Contest for work they completed in V's screenwriting class last year. American Zoetrope is Francis Ford Coppola's motion picture production company, and the contest's aim is "to seek out and encourage compelling film narratives, and to introduce the next generation of great screenwriters to today's leading production companies and agencies."</p><p>Nate Edelman, a 2006 UCSC graduate with a B.A. in cinema and theater studies, was a semifinalist for his script "Scavengers of County Hell," and film and digital media major Matt Golad  was a quarterfinalist with "The Sutterman Bill." These first-time screenwriters were competing in a pool of 2,500 entries.</p><p>"For the majority of students, the script they complete in Film 196B is the first feature-length script they've ever written," said V. "It's the very beginning of a long career path--professional screenwriters normally write at least a dozen scripts before they sell one. The screenwriting contests are a terrific way for developing writers to work on their skills and gauge their achievement level." </p><p>The new screenplay reading event is made possible by a grant from the UCSC Instructional Improvement Program through the Center for Teaching Excellence in the Chancellor's Office.

Based on the interactions of light and matter, spectroscopy is often used to identify substances by the wavelengths of light they absorb or emit. Conventional systems have many large components, whereas the compact, fully planar device developed at UCSC enables the study of atoms and molecules on a chip-based platform with integrated optics, said Holger Schmidt, associate professor of electrical engineering. </p><p>Schmidt's group and his collaborators at Brigham Young University described the first monolithically integrated, planar rubidium cell on a chip in a paper published in the June issue of <i>Nature Photonics.</i> The first author of the paper is Wenge Yang, a postdoctoral researcher in Schmidt's lab at UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering.</p><p>According to Schmidt, potential applications for this technology include frequency stabilization for lasers, gas detection sensors, and quantum information processing.</p><p>"To stabilize lasers, people use precision spectroscopy with bulk rubidium vapor cells. We could build a little integrated frequency stabilization chip that would do that more easily than a conventional frequency stabilization circuit," Schmidt said.</p><p>That project is already under way in Schmidt's lab. Other applications, such as quantum information processing, are more long-term goals, he said.</p><p>The key to the group's achievement is their development of hollow-core optical waveguides based on antiresonant reflecting optical waveguide (ARROW) principles. In previous publications, Schmidt and his collaborators have described other uses of ARROW waveguides integrated into chips using standard silicon fabrication technology (see <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=578">earlier press release</a>). </p><p>To perform atomic spectroscopy, the researchers incorporated rubidium reservoirs into a chip, connecting the reservoirs to hollow-core waveguides so that the optical beam path is filled with rubidium atoms. The resulting vapor cell is completely self-contained and has an active cell volume about 80 million times smaller than a conventional cell, Schmidt said. </p><p>"We used rubidium as a proof of principle, but this technique is applicable to any gaseous medium. So it has potentially far-reaching implications," Schmidt said.</p><p>In addition to its use in laser frequency stabilization, rubidium vapor is widely used in quantum optics experiments and has been used to slow the speed of light.</p><p>"Fundamental concepts in quantum information processing have been demonstrated in principle using bulk rubidium systems. To be practical you can't have big optical tables in all the places you would want to use it, but now we can make this technology more compact and portable," Schmidt said.</p><p>In addition to Schmidt, the coauthors of the <i>Nature Photonics</i> article include Donald Conkey and Aaron Hawkins of Brigham Young University, as well as UCSC graduate student Bin Wu and postdoctoral researcher Dongliang Yin. This research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Slow Light Program of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Schmidt at (831) 459-1482 or hschmidt@soe.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915233c48072704601a012ff447f3673"><name>1359</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Symposium honors chemistry professor Anthony Fink</title><summary>Friends, colleagues, and students of chemistry professor Anthony Fink came to campus May 26 to attend a symposium in Fink's honor.

Former grad students and postdoctoral associates traveled from Japan, Mexico, South America, and all over the U.S. to attend the event. </p><p>The Anthony L. Fink Symposium, held at Baskin Auditorium, included presentations by six researchers in Fink's field of neurodegenerative diseases and the study of proteins. The speakers were David Eisenberg of UCLA, Donato Di Monte of the Parkinson's Institute, Robert Nussbaum of UCSF, Lisa Ellerby of the Buck Institute, UCSC's Harry Noller, and Greg Petsko of Brandeis University. </p><p>Fink has made seminal contributions in fundamental areas of biophysical chemistry. In recent years, he has emerged as a world authority on the mechanism by which proteins assume misfolded conformations en route to forming insoluble aggregates. These investigations are highly significant because it is now recognized that numerous debilitating neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and the prion diseases, are linked to the formation of <i>in vivo</i> misfolded protein aggregates.</p><p>Fink, who has taught at UCSC since 1969, also holds an appointment as an adjunct senior scientist at the Parkinson's Institute in Sunnyvale. He has over 200 publications, many of which have been cited hundreds of times, as well as books and book chapters. He was elected a Fellow of the American Association for Advancement of Science in 2004. In addition, he is an accomplished photographer, whose work was included in Santa Cruz County's Open Studios last year.</p><p>Fink has mentored 54 graduate students and about 40 postdoctoral associates. Ninety undergraduate students have also carried out research and independent study with him. Fink is known for treating his lab team like family and planning potluck meals, bike rides, and camping trips with the group. Many of his former students have continued to stay in touch after leaving UCSC.</p><p>The symposium emcee was chemistry professor Glenn Millhauser, and department chair Ólöf Einarsdöttir gave introductory remarks. The program ended with acknowledgements from members of the Academic Senate, former students, and family, as well as a few words from Fink. The symposium concluded with a public reception on the quad at Baskin Engineering.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915238e18072704601a012ff2846c8cb"><name>1363</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Blumenthal tells Senate that capital projects are back in state budget</title><summary>Funds for UCSC's building projects have been added back into the state budget, Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal told the Academic Senate May 30.</summary><author>Guy Lasnier, (831) 459-2955, lasnier@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Academic Senate</keywords><description>Funds for UCSC's building projects have been added back into the state budget, Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal told the Academic Senate May 30.</description><start-date>1180940400000</start-date><display-name>Blumenthal tells Senate that...</display-name><path>/2007/06/1363</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/06/1363</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338338987</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338338987</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2955</phone><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Funds for UCSC's building projects have been added back into the state budget, Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal told the Academic Senate May 30.</p><p>Blumenthal also said both houses of the Democratic-majority state legislature added $19 million for University of California academic preparation programs into the budget. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger did not allocate money for the projects in his original budget; his  revised budget was released May 15. It is awaiting approval by the Legislature and the governor's signature. </p><p>The capital projects--the Biomedical Sciences Facility, McHenry Library expansion, equipment for the planned Digital Arts and New Media Building, and infrastructure improvements--were part of Proposition 1D passed last November. But State Sen. Joe Simitian, D-Palo Alto, and members of the Assembly removed the items from UC's budget, pending assurances that UC campuses would make fair-share contributions to mitigate impacts on local communities. </p><p>"Our capital projects will go forward," Blumenthal said in his report to the Senate, adding, "they'll be expensive."</p><p>He also reiterated his support for improved child care on campus, another expensive proposition. Blumenthal said that creative reconfigurations have opened up a dozen new spaces for children, but "we really need additional facilities.

<p>Abresch-Meyer, who graduated from UCSC in December 2006, is the first recipient of the Primary Care Physician Award sponsored by Sutter Maternity &amp; Surgery Center and Central Coast Alliance for Health (CCAH). The $10,000 award is meant to support a student who plans to focus on primary care medicine and intends to come back to the Central Coast to practice.</p>
<p>"Strong primary care corresponds to better health outcomes at lower cost, and I would like to be a part of this process in an area of California that I have come to love," said Abresch-Meyer.</p>
<p>The shortage of primary care physicians is a growing national problem that is exacerbated in areas such as the Central Coast by low Medicare reimbursement rates, said Larry deGhetaldi, CEO of Sutter Santa Cruz. Abresch-Meyer's selection for the award was announced at a meeting Thursday (May 31) at which Rep. Sam Farr briefed deGhetaldi and other regional health care leaders on a bill he has introduced to fix inequities in Medicare reimbursement rates.</p>
<p>In congratulating Abresch-Meyer, Farr noted that the difficulty of attracting and retaining doctors in this area makes it especially important to encourage students already in the community to pursue careers in health care. DeGhetaldi, a UCSC alumnus and a UCSC Foundation trustee, noted that about 10 percent of the doctors in Santa Cruz County are UCSC alumni. Alan McKay, executive director of CCAH, is also a UCSC alumnus.</p>
<p>"We want to encourage UCSC as a feeder for medical schools, because a lot of those doctors come back and practice in this region," deGhetaldi said. "This award is really a symbolic scholarship that honors the role of primary care physicians and recognizes the creation of a comprehensive and innovative health sciences program at UCSC."</p>
<p>Established in 2003, UCSC's health sciences program is the campus's fastest growing major and is already one of the most popular, said Grant Hartzog, an associate professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology who has been involved in creating and overseeing the program. The program is administered by the Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology.</p>
<p>"We have gone from zero to nearly 600 students in the major in less than four years, and it is drawing in people who are likely to come back and serve the Monterey Bay region," Hartzog said. "We have also found that in terms of ethnicity and economic background, this major is more diverse than the campus population as a whole."</p>
<p>With requirements such as Spanish-language courses and community internships, the program was designed to help meet the needs of California for well-trained health care practitioners.</p>
<p>"California is not training enough doctors to meet our needs, and the whole UC system needs to address that," deGhetaldi said. "I was particularly pleased to see the Spanish-language component in UCSC's program. If you're training future doctors for California, that's a no-brainer."</p>
<p>Abresch-Meyer is fluent in Spanish as a result of the Spanish immersion program in her elementary school. She has served as a translator for Spanish patients at the UC Davis Medical Center and as an HIV Test Counselor at UCSC. A Certified Massage Therapist, she operated her own massage business throughout college. She was accepted by five medical schools, but she has not made a final decision yet and has deferred enrollment until 2008.</p>
<p>Funded by a gift to UCSC from Sutter Maternity &amp; Surgery Center, the Sutter Maternity &amp; Surgery Center/Central Coast Alliance for Health Primary Care Physician Award is intended to benefit the mission of CCAH to provide quality primary care to Medi-Cal recipients in the Central Coast region. CCAH is a nonprofit health plan that serves more than 85,000 members in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties and works to improve access to health care for lower-income residents.</p>

The facility will be shared by UCSC researchers using human embryonic stem cells in efforts that may ultimately lead to new therapies for conditions ranging from Parkinson's disease to birth defects.</p><p>The grant provides funding for the renovation of 2,000 square feet of laboratory space in the Sinsheimer Laboratories Building, as well as equipment and staffing for the new laboratory. It was among $50 million in facilities grants approved by the CIRM governing board on June 5 to fund shared research laboratories at 17 California research institutions. In previous rounds of funding from CIRM, UC Santa Cruz has received $2.2 million dollars in stem cell research grants and training grants.</p><p>"We have an interdisciplinary group of researchers that has done a great job of coming together to build a stem cell research program at UC Santa Cruz," said Lindsay Hinck, associate professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, who will direct the new stem cell facility.</p><p>Bruce Margon, vice chancellor for research, noted that UCSC has received the same level of support from CIRM as much larger campuses, such as UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco.</p><p>"It speaks to our emerging visibility in this area of research," Margon said. "We have a small but very powerful cadre of researchers in this field. They have promising ideas and are ready to proceed, so this award comes at the right time."</p><p>Stem cell research in the United States is currently limited by federal policy that prohibits research involving human embryonic stem cells isolated after August 2001 from being conducted in laboratories constructed with any federal funding. The new facility, constructed with state funding, will enable UCSC researchers to use new lines of human embryonic stem cells in their research.</p><p>"It has become clear that the few lines of human embryonic stem cells approved under the federal policy are very limited in their usefulness," Hinck said. "They don't grow well, many of them are contaminated, and they were derived in suboptimal conditions. So it is really important to be able to bring in new stem cell lines that can open up the potential for medical breakthroughs."</p><p>Stem cell research projects at UCSC are aimed at providing insights and tools to address neurological and genetic conditions such as Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease), and Down syndrome. This research will also aid in the development of gene therapy strategies.</p><p>UCSC researchers aim to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Drawing on their broad range of expertise in development, genetics, genomics, and molecular, cell and computational biology, these researchers are using interdisciplinary approaches to tackle problems concerning how genes are regulated in human embryonic stem cells, and how this regulation influences their ability to both self-renew and differentiate into specific cellular subtypes. Defining and ultimately controlling this process is an essential step in designing medical therapies based on the use of stem cells.</p><p>CIRM was established in 2004 with the passage of Proposition 71, the California Stem Cell Research and Cures Initiative. The statewide ballot measure, which provided $3 billion in funding for stem cell research at California universities and research institutions, was approved by California voters and called for the establishment of an entity to make grants and provide loans for stem cell research, research facilities, and other vital research opportunities. CIRM is the largest source of funding for human embryonic stem cell research in the world.

Wang is conducting research in bioinformatics with David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE). The fellowship will support Wang for three years of research on regulatory networks for gene transcription. </p><p> </p><p>"Receiving this fellowship shows a recognition for the kind of research I want to conduct and for the environment in which I want to do it," Wang said. "Getting this fellowship further convinced me that I made a good choice to join the Haussler group at UCSC. The Whitney Foundation has a history of funding researchers at the top universities in the top groups."</p><p>The foundation focuses on support for basic biomedical research through postdoctoral research fellowships. Wang's proposed research in the relatively young field of computationally driven regulatory genomics represents a new approach that has changed the way modern genomics research is done, he said.  </p><p>Wang came to UCSC in September 2006 from Washington University in St. Louis, where he earned his Ph.D. in computational biology. At Washington University, he investigated the regulation of DNA transcription, the process by which a gene sequence on the chromosome is copied to a "messenger RNA" molecule that carries the genetic instructions to other components of the cell. In Haussler's lab, Wang is continuing to study transcriptional regulation, although the focus of his work has changed. </p><p>  </p><p>"This is the most fundamental regulatory mechanism," he said. "When and where the genome message is expressed is controlled by transcriptional regulation. It is fundamental to understanding life, and it impacts physiology and  human diseases." </p><p>Differences in the regulation of gene transcription probably underlie many of the differences between species as well as those between individuals of the same species, Wang said. Comparing genomes between individual humans reveals differences in single nucleotides (the As, Cs, Gs, and Ts of the genetic code) and variations in the number of copies of particular nucleotide segments. These variations result from events that leave the genome with nucleotides substituted, inserted, or deleted. Since most of these variations reside outside of genes, scientists suspect that they mostly affect gene regulation. </p><p>In graduate school, Wang used data about the origin and evolution of species -- phylogenetic data -- to identify the binding sites for individual transcription factors. When a transcription factor binds to a binding site, the factor then interacts with general transcription machinery for either activation or repression of a gene. </p><p>In higher organisms, things can get more complicated. Because proteins interact with each other, combinations of transcription factors acting at more than one binding site determine the fate or expression of a gene. So Wang has moved on from simply identifying individual transcription factors to looking for arrays of transcription factor binding sites that can convey identifiable expression patterns. </p><p>An array of binding sites that interact with each other forms a module -- a composition of a variety of signals. Wang hopes to elucidate the relationship between regulatory modules and the targets they regulate. Discerning these connections will lead to an understanding of the network of cascading interactions that determines the fate of a cell or an organism. </p><p>  </p><p>The emphasis on evolutionary genomics in the Haussler laboratory has expanded Wang's appreciation of how transcription factors work. Exploring how binding sites and modules have evolved aids in understanding their function. Understanding the evolution of transcription factors may reveal regulatory differences responsible for some human diseases. Transcript regulation could be fundamental to disease susceptibility, Wang said. </p><p>"If mistakes occur at one of the steps, the cell may go to a completely different fate. Some may become cancer. This has direct implications to human diseases," he said. "I don't expect to be able to answer this by myself. It will require a lot of scientists to add to the body of knowledge about regulation. I am just trying to tackle the problem from one angle." </p><p>Whitney fellows, their scientific advisors, and a few other selected scientists and Whitney trustees attend a two- to three-day meeting each year to present and discuss their research. Wang said he looked forward to attending this meeting, which offers valuable networking opportunities.</p><p>"One of the main things the foundation does for its members is to create a framework for collaboration. Collaboration is the key to success these days," he said. </p><p>Before coming to the United States, Wang was a biology student at Peking University in Beijing, China. He earned a master's degree in computer science while working as a medical research technician at Washington University because he thought it would launch his biology career in a different direction. He didn't know that one day he would be doing computational biology until he was halfway through the master's degree. </p><p>"That's when the genome project blossomed, and I found myself very well equipped to go after that path," he said.  </p><p>The Whitney Foundation supports early postdoctoral research training in all basic biomedical sciences. To attain its ultimate goal of increasing the number of imaginative, well-trained, and dedicated medical scientists, the foundation grants financial support of sufficient duration to help further the careers of young scientists engaged in biological or medical research. The foundation awards 20 three-year research fellowships annually -- more than 900 since its inception. </p><p>Five current UCSC faculty members are former Whitney fellows: Thomas Schleich, professor of chemistry and biochemistry (1968); William Sullivan, professor of molecular, cell and developmental (MCD) biology (1985); Douglas Kellogg, professor and chair of MCD biology (1991); Theodore Holman, professor of chemistry and biochemistry (1991); and Melissa Jurica, assistant professor of MCD biology (2000).</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915240d98072704601a012ff677548e2"><name>1370</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Julie Guthman receives book award</title><summary>Julie Guthman, assistant professor of community studies, has received  the 2007 Frederick H.

Among Guthman's major findings was the discovery that many growers switched from conventional farming to organic agriculture to increase earnings and to comply with intermediary buyers' requests, not out of a commitment to environmental stewardship.</p><p>The paradox referred to in the title stems from California's unique agricultural system of year-round, high-intensity, specialty-crop production that largely relies on migrant farm labor-a far cry from the agrarian tradition associated with the family farm. With the high cost of land, growers are under  great pressure to get more crop value per acre. The result is an organic system that in many ways replicates the conventional agribusiness model, according to Guthman.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9152421a8072704601a012ffd0e5b0f3"><name>1372</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus Phone Number Prefix Change</title><start-date>1181113200000</start-date><display-name>Campus Phone Number Prefix...</display-name><path>/2007/06/1372</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/06/1372</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338341339</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338341339</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We write to remind you about a change in the campus assigned phone numbers.

<p>The ceremony was part of Student Achievement Week, a showcase of student research, artwork, and performances.</p>
<p>The event included a welcome from Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal, with William Ladusaw, vice provost and dean of undergraduate education serving as emcee. Presentation of the Deans' and Chancellor's Awards was made by the leaders of each academic division. Loren Steck presented the Steck Award and spoke to the gathering.</p>
<p>Awards and scholarships included:</p>
<p><strong>Loren Steck Award.</strong> The Loren Steck Award honors the finest senior thesis completed during an academic year, with the winner chosen from the Chancellor's Award candidates. Sebastian Burke was selected for his thesis, "The Creative Process: A Film on Physicist Richard Feynman and his Perspective on the Nuclear bomb in Relation to Science." His faculty adviser is film and digital media associate professor Lawrence Andrews.</p>
<p><strong>Strauss Award.</strong> Each year, the Strauss Scholarships fund at least 14 public-service projects proposed by college juniors in California. The late Donald Strauss of Newport Beach demonstrated a strong commitment to public service. His widow, Dorothy M. R. Strauss, established the foundation in 1997 as a tribute to her husband. This year's Strauss Award winners, Ariel Tenebaum and Justin Wiley, plan to use the $10,000 scholarship to establish an educational hands-on gardening and nutrition program at a local high school for at-risk youths whose population is predominantly Latino. Nutrition-related diseases, such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes, have been on the rise in the United States, and have impacted many Latino communities. Tenebaum and Wiley's project will teach students about nutrition and is designed to empower them to take direct action toward improving students' access to healthy food options at school and in the community. Strong advocates of this startup program/new initiative include Santa Cruz United Way, Life Lab Science Program, and the Second Harvest Food Bank.</p>
<p><strong>Kenneth and Ann Thimann Scholarship.</strong> Professor emeritus of biology at UCSC Kenneth Thimann and his wife, Ann (both now deceased), established this pledge of support to UCSC in recognition of future UCSC graduate science scholars. The scholarship award of $2,000 is intended for use in graduate studies. David Dawson, who will receive his bachelor's of science in applied physics, received the award. Dawson has been accepted to Stanford University's graduate program in aeronautics and astronautics, where he will study fluid physics.</p>
<p><strong>Deans' and Chancellor's Awards.</strong> These awards recognize outstanding achievements by undergraduate students. Ten Deans' Awards are awarded to students within each division (Arts, Engineering, Humanities, Physical &amp; Biological Sciences, Social Sciences). Of those students, up to three in each division can be selected to receive a Chancellor's Award. Students as well as their mentors were recognized at the ceremony.</p>

4,200 freshmen--several hundred more than had been expected--have indicated they plan to enroll at UC Santa Cruz in the fall. UCSC's Office of Admissions received a "Statement of Intent to Register" (SIR) from 4,236 students by the May 1 UC-wide deadline; campus officials had been expecting 3,750 to accept offers of admission.</p><p>The University of California today (June 12, 2007) released systemwide SIR numbers for the fall 2007 freshman class.</p><p>"We are proud to welcome this class to our campus and very gratified by their strong interest in UC Santa Cruz," said Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal. "The size of the class is a reflection of the increasing awareness that UCSC offers quality programs led by quality people in a quality setting."</p><p>"We are pleased by the popularity of the campus," added William Ladusaw, vice provost and dean of undergraduate education. "Our challenge now--which we accept--is to ensure that every one of our incoming freshmen receives the same access to academic offerings and to on-campus housing that prior classes have enjoyed."</p><p>Kevin Browne, executive director of admissions and university registrar, said the campus expects that--as is always the case at UCSC and on other campuses--a percentage of the students who filed SIRs will not enroll in the fall. "When the quarter actually begins, we'll probably enroll a freshman class of 3,800," Browne said.</p><p>He added that the higher-than-expected SIR number for fall may lead the campus to revise downward its winter-quarter admission numbers.</p><p>Browne said UCSC's admissions officers had seen anecdotal evidence of rising interest in UCSC before the final numbers were in, but even they were surprised by the extent of the campus's popularity among prospective freshmen.</p><p>"Interest in our campus and academic offerings seemed extremely high from the thousands of students and families who visited the campus in the weeks leading up to the SIR deadline, and there was a buzz from high school counselors about students' interest in UCSC," said Browne. Well-attended admissions receptions, featuring Acting Chancellor Blumenthal, in several large metropolitan areas also helped get the word out about UC Santa Cruz. "We saw SIR increases from each of the regions in which these receptions were held," Browne said, adding that an increase in SIRs was also evident in students from Santa Clara County.  </p><p>"We've seen an increase in popularity while retaining the academic quality of the incoming class," Browne said. "And we're very pleased to report that this will be our most ethnically diverse freshman class ever." </p><p>Ladusaw said staff, faculty, and administrators have been strategizing to meet the new class's academic expectations. "We are arranging to have more instructors in classes with heavy freshman enrollments, and we are expanding existing courses or adding new ones as needed," he said.</p><p>Jean Marie Scott, acting vice chancellor for student affairs, said substantial expansion in on-campus residential halls and apartments in recent years gives the campus considerable flexibility in responding to the housing needs of a larger-than-expected freshman class. Within the UC system, UCSC has traditionally housed the highest percentage of its undergraduate students--nearly half--in university housing.

Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have found that female side-blotched lizards are able to induce different color patterns in their offspring in response to social cues, "dressing" their progeny in patterns they will wear for the rest of their lives. The mother's influence gives her progeny the patterns most likely to ensure success under the conditions they will encounter as adults.</p><p>In a paper published June 10 in the online early edition of the journal <i>Ecology Letters</i> (and in a later print issue), the researchers reported that female side-blotched lizards give an extra dose of the hormone estradiol to their eggs in certain social circumstances. The extra hormone affects the back patterns of lizards that hatch from those eggs, creating either lengthwise stripes down their backs or bars stretching from side to side. Whether they get stripes or bars depends on the genes for other traits.</p><p>"This is the first example in which exposure to the mother's hormones changes such a fundamental aspect of appearance. Even more exciting is that the mother has different patterns at her disposal, so she can ensure a good match between back patterns and other traits that her offspring possess," said Lesley Lancaster, a UCSC graduate student and first author of the paper. </p><p>Coauthor Barry Sinervo, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, is Lancaster's adviser and has been studying side-blotched lizards for nearly 20 years. He said the lizards' main predator, the coachwhip snake, is a highly efficient hunter, and the lizards need just the right combination of traits to avoid being eaten.</p><p>"The females are dressing their progeny for success, because they need a different back pattern in different conditions," Sinervo said. "It's like fashion--she wants to make the rare, fashionable progeny that won't be caught by predators."</p><p>Lancaster used a combination of laboratory and field experiments to tease apart a complex set of interactions involving hormones, genetics, social interactions, behavioral strategies, and predators. Previous studies by Sinervo and his collaborators have described three different behavioral strategies that correlate with throat color in side-blotched lizards. Orange-throated males are highly aggressive and usurp territory from other lizards; yellow-throated males sneak into the territories of other males to mate with females; and blue-throated males form partnerships and cooperate to protect their territories. In females, throat color correlates with different reproductive strategies.</p><p>According to Lancaster, the maternal effect on back pattern is important because survival in these lizards depends on different combinations of traits in different circumstances. Females use social cues to predict the circumstances their progeny will encounter. Maternal influences like this probably occur in many species, but are very difficult to detect, Sinervo said.</p><p>"Maternal effects are a nebulous thing to study, because you know there are genes for these traits, and it's really hard to tell the maternal effects apart from the effects of the genes," he said.</p><p>Lancaster began by treating side-blotched lizard eggs with an array of different hormones. That revealed a striking influence of estradiol on back patterns. She also tested eggs from lizards captured in the wild and found a wide range of naturally occurring estradiol concentrations in the egg yolks. </p><p>The researchers then performed experiments in breeding enclosures, each holding one male lizard and three females. The numbers of orange- and yellow-throated females in each enclosure were experimentally varied, and throat colors of the males varied randomly. Lancaster tested eggs from each female's clutch for hormone levels and recorded the color patterns of the progeny before releasing them into the wild to see how well they survived.</p><p>To avoid predators, the lizards need a back pattern that matches their behavior. Sneaky yellow-throated males like to hide in the grass and need a barred pattern that breaks up the outline of their body so it blends in with the background. Aggressive orange males spend a lot of time in the open and need stripes to help them escape from predators (the optical effect of stripes on fast-moving prey makes them hard to catch). </p><p>But the genes that control behavior and back pattern are not linked, so a lizard could end up with a mismatch that would leave it highly vulnerable to predators--wearing stripes and trying to hide in the grass, for example. Lancaster identified two pathways by which an extra dose of estradiol from the mother can help to resolve this problem.</p><p>In one pathway, females increased the amount of estradiol to their eggs when their mate had a yellow throat. The hormone induced a barred back pattern in yellow-throated offspring. The barred pattern was not induced in non-yellow progeny. </p><p>In the other pathway, the extra hormone was prompted by an abundance of orange-throated lizards in the female's social environment. In orange-throated sons, the hormone induced a striped back pattern (suitable for an aggressive male spending lots of time in the open). Stripes were also induced in non-orange daughters. Both of these effects were inhibited by yellow genes.</p><p>"This is a classic example of an interaction between genes and environmental influences on traits," Lancaster said. "Females provide an estradiol-rich prenatal environment to their entire clutch, but different progeny respond to it in different ways depending on which genes they inherit for throat color. So a female could make some progeny barred and others from the same clutch striped, depending on what's best for each individual."</p><p>It is not yet clear why an "orange" social environment triggers this hormonal tweaking of the eggs. </p><p>"The females are responding to cues that predict something about the future environment, but we're not sure yet exactly what that is," Lancaster said. "Orange-throated neighbors may indicate a trend in the frequency of orange-throated lizards within the population or in the overall population density."</p><p>According to Sinervo, the density of the lizard population is probably a critical factor. At high densities, the aggressive orange-throated males are so busy fighting with other lizards that they are especially vulnerable to predators. As a result, the predators are likely to focus on them, giving a survival advantage to lizards with different patterns.</p><p>After Lancaster released the lizards from her breeding experiments into the wild, she found that the ones whose mothers had tweaked their back patterns had a clear survival advantage. The highest survival rates were seen in the induced progeny types--yellow-throated lizards of both sexes with barred backs, orange-throated males with striped backs, and blue-throated females with striped backs.</p><p>"The frequencies of yellow and orange were both increasing in the wild that year, so the females exposed to orange neighbors and yellow sires in the experiments had the most fit progeny," Lancaster said. "But under different environments, maybe the progeny that weren't tweaked would have the highest fitness. If these same estradiol-induced types had the highest survival rates in all years, there would be no need for the females to respond to their social environment--they would just always give their eggs estradiol."</p><p>To understand these complex interactions more fully, the researchers plan to study the hormones and their effects in the field over several generations of lizards.</p><p>In addition to Lancaster and Sinervo, the other coauthors of the paper are UCSC postdoctoral researcher Andrew McAdam and John Wingfield of the University of Washington. This research was supported by the National Science Foundation, Sigma Xi, and the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Lancaster at lesley@biology.ucsc.edu and Sinervo at (831) 459-3425 or sinervo@biology.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91524fee8072704601a012ff336b3f5f"><name>1389</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Welcoming Guests to UC Santa Cruz</title><start-date>1181631600000</start-date><display-name>Welcoming Guests to UC...</display-name><path>/2007/06/1389</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/06/1389</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338344895</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338344895</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>From June 24 through September 1, UCSC will usher in another conference season, welcoming approximately 10,000 visitors to our campus.

The results of the project, published today in a set of papers in two journals, promise to reshape our understanding of how the human genome functions.</p>
<p>The findings challenge the traditional view of our genetic blueprint as a tidy collection of independent genes, pointing instead to a complex network in which genes, along with regulatory elements and other types of DNA sequences that do not code for proteins, interact in overlapping ways not yet fully understood.</p>
<p>The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group headed by David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering, and Jim Kent, associate research scientist, adapted the internationally recognized <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE">UCSC Genome Browser</a> as the data repository for this project. The UCSC Genome Browser web site allows researchers unencumbered access to the wealth of data produced by the international consortium. It showcases this data so that genetic scientists can mine it for clues about how the body works in health and in disease.</p>
<p>In a group paper published in the June 14 issue of <em>Nature</em> and in 28 companion papers published in the June issue of <em>Genome Research,</em> the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium, which is organized by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), reported results of its exhaustive, four-year effort to build a parts list of all biologically functional elements in 1 percent of the human genome. Carried out by 35 groups from 80 organizations around the world, the research served as a pilot to test the feasibility of a full-scale initiative to produce a comprehensive catalog of all components of the human genome crucial for biological function.</p>
<p>"The sheer number of ENCODE data providers and the diversity of experimental methods used to generate this data presented a challenge to the UCSC team," said Kate Rosenbloom, lead software developer on the UCSC ENCODE team. "We were continually customizing our software for effective visualization and efficient retrieval of new data types."</p>
<p>The <em>Nature</em> publication includes a pull-out poster that is a screenshot of the UCSC Genome Browser concisely displaying a broad range of the ENCODE data.</p>
<p>In addition to serving as a data repository, the UCSC team has provided programming for the comparative genomics aspect of the ENCODE project through the Multi-Species Sequence Analysis Group. By aligning the human genome with the genomes of other species, it is possible to glean an understanding of the relative importance and roles of different DNA sequences. The UCSC Genome Browser has been designed to provide such alignments, and it currently displays 38 species, from simple organisms such as yeast and worms to mice, chimps, and humans. Comparative genomics is a major focus of Haussler's research group.</p>
<p>Authors of the ENCODE papers include researchers from academic, government, and industry organizations located in Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The ENCODE project has been open to all interested researchers who agree to abide by the consortium's guidelines.</p>
<p>The UCSC team, led by Haussler and Kent, includes software developers Kate Rosenbloom and Rachel Harte, project manager Donna Karolchik, quality assurance manager Robert Kuhn, graduate student Daryl Thomas, and postdoctoral scholar Ting Wang, along with the entire genome browser staff and other graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the Haussler lab.</p>
<p>Several of the UCSC participants attended an "ENCODE analysis jamboree" in Washington, D.C., in July 2005, where they provided custom programming services to consortium members and trained them in the use of the UCSC ENCODE browser. The UCSC group also hosted two ENCODE analysis groups for several days of focus on genes, gene transcription, and transcription regulation.</p>
<p>"This impressive effort has uncovered many exciting surprises and blazed the way for future efforts to explore the functional landscape of the entire human genome," said NHGRI director Francis Collins. "Because of the hard work and keen insights of the ENCODE consortium, the scientific community will need to rethink some long-held views about what genes are and what they do, as well as how the genome's functional elements have evolved. This could have significant implications for efforts to identify the DNA sequences involved in many human diseases."</p>
<p>The completion of the Human Genome Project in April 2003--aided by the bioinformatics contribution of Haussler and Kent--was a major achievement, but the sequencing of the genome marked just the first step toward the goal of using such information to diagnose, treat, and prevent disease. In recent years, researchers have made major strides in using DNA sequence data to identify genes, which are traditionally defined as the parts of the genome that code for proteins. The protein-coding component of these genes makes up just a small fraction of the human genome--1.5 percent to 2 percent.</p>
<p>Evidence exists that other parts of the genome also have important functions. Until now, however, most studies have concentrated on functional elements associated with specific genes and have not provided insights about functional elements throughout the genome. The ENCODE project represents the first systematic effort to determine where all types of functional elements are located and how they are organized.</p>
<p>In the pilot phase, ENCODE researchers devised and tested high-throughput approaches for identifying functional elements in the genome. Those elements included genes that code for proteins; genes that do not code for proteins; regulatory elements that control the transcription of genes; and elements that maintain the structure of chromosomes and mediate the dynamics of their replication.</p>
<p>The collaborative study focused on 44 targets, which together cover about 1 percent of the human genome sequence, or about 30 million DNA base pairs. The targets were strategically selected to provide a representative cross section of the entire human genome. All told, the ENCODE consortium generated more than 200 data sets and analyzed more than 600 million data points.</p>
<p>"Our results reveal important principles about the organization of functional elements in the human genome, providing new perspectives on everything from DNA transcription to mammalian evolution. In particular, we gained significant insight into DNA sequences that do not encode proteins, which we knew very little about before," said Ewan Birney, head of genome annotation at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) in Hinxton, England, who led ENCODE's massive data integration and analysis effort.</p>
<p>The ENCODE consortium's major findings include the discovery that the majority of DNA in the human genome is transcribed into functional molecules, called RNA, and that these transcripts extensively overlap one another. This broad pattern of transcription challenges the long-standing view that the human genome consists of a relatively small set of discrete genes, along with a vast amount of so-called junk DNA that is not biologically active.</p>
<p>The new data indicate the genome contains very little unused sequence and is, in fact, a complex, interwoven network. In this network, genes are just one of many types of DNA sequences that have a functional impact.</p>
<p>"Our perspective of transcription and genes may have to evolve," the researchers state in their <em>Nature</em> paper, noting the network model of the genome "poses some interesting mechanistic questions" that have yet to be answered.</p>

"His contribution to the philosophy of mind, in particular, is deep and wide-ranging. It bears upon philosophical questions concerning introspection, perception, concept-formation, the understanding of rules, the relation between mind and brain, artificial intelligence, and many other subjects of contemporary concern."</p><p>They added that although it is widely recognized that Wittgenstein's work on these issues is groundbreaking and enduring, his contributions have not received the kind of attention from contemporary philosophers of mind that many insist they deserve.</p><p>Professors Ellis and Guevara have raised nearly $50,000 for the conference from a wide range of supporters, including Cowell College, UCSC's Institute for Humanities Research, UC Humanities Research Institute, Sydney E. Frank Foundation, the Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor's Office, the Departments of Philosophy, Literature, Linguistics, History of Consciousness, and Psychology, the Deans of Humanities and Social Sciences, Bonny Doon Vineyard, Peter Beckmann, J.

The theme for the gathering, which took place at Maggiano's restaurant in Los Angeles, was "Achieving Excellence Together." Ten past chairs of the Council of UC Staff Assemblies (CUCSA) were in attendance, including UCSC's Rosemary Anderson. Past UCSC delegates Patt Takeuchi and Ed Titus and current delegates Judy Scarborough and Marco Garcia also attended.</p><p>The UC Regents voted in January to permanently add two UC employees as advisors to the board. The action followed the completion of a two-year pilot program designed to increase direct communication between UC employees and Regents, and to help facilitate the inclusion of the views of staff and non-Senate academic employees in board deliberations. </p><p>A proclamation presented at the event by President Dynes to the first staff advisors, David Bell and David Miller, reads:</p><p><ul>"For contributions of the highest order to the University of California through your pioneering service as a dynamic representative of the University's staff and through the invaluable perspective you brought to the deliberations of the Board of Regents, this recognition is presented with warmest appreciation, friendship, and esteem."</ul></p><p>CUCSA delegates have worked with dedication and tenacity for over 15 years to achieve the goal of having permanent staff advisors to the Regents, and this year's success is due in part to the support and collaboration of President Dynes, Associate President Williams, Acting Chancellor Blumenthal, and a number of UC Regents and Office of the President staff members. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91525e6b8072704601a012ff55b38b29"><name>1399</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz biologist Hinrich Boeger named Pew Scholar in the Biomedical Sciences</title><summary>The Pew Charitable Trusts has named Hinrich Boeger, assistant professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, a Pew Scholar in the Biomedical Sciences.</summary><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Hinrich Boeger, Pew Scholar</keywords><description>The Pew Charitable Trusts has named Hinrich Boeger, assistant professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, a Pew Scholar in the Biomedical Sciences.</description><start-date>1182236400000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz biologist...</display-name><path>/2007/06/1399</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/06/1399</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338348600</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338348600</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/06/images/boeger.150.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/06/images/boeger.150.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>boeger.150.jpg</name><file-size>45884</file-size><width>150</width><height>172</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Hinrich Boeger</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Pew Charitable Trusts has named Hinrich Boeger, assistant professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, a Pew Scholar in the Biomedical Sciences. Boeger will receive $240,000 over four years to support his research on the mechanisms involved in regulation of gene activity in cells.</p><p>The Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical Sciences, funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts, is designed to support young investigators of outstanding promise in the basic and clinical sciences relevant to the advancement of human health. Nominations for the prestigious awards are invited from a limited number of institutions selected on the basis of the scope of their work in biomedical research. </p><p>Boeger studies how DNA is packaged in the chromosomes and how the packaging mechanisms are involved in the regulation of gene activity. </p><p>"All the cells in our body contain the same DNA, and the reason cells differ and can perform different functions is because different sets of genes are turned on in different cells," Boeger said. </p><p>Chromosomes consist of a complex structure of DNA and proteins called chromatin, which allows several feet of linear DNA molecules to be neatly packaged within the microscopic nucleus of every cell. Increasing evidence points to changes in chromatin structure as an important mechanism for gene regulation. In particular, Boeger's research indicates that the nucleosome, a basic building block of chromatin structure, plays a key role in turning genes on and off.</p><p>Boeger's lab studies gene regulation in yeast cells, focusing on a regulatory element in the DNA called a promoter. He has shown that activation of the promoter involves the complete unfolding of the nucleosomes in that section of DNA. Furthermore, his studies suggest that nucleosomes are continually removed and reassembled during promoter activation.</p><p>"Under activating conditions, the promoter is switching between transcriptionally active and inactive states, and this seems to involve the disassembly and reassembly of the nucleosomes," Boeger said. "So promoter activation involves the transition from a static to a dynamic state and eventually approaches a dynamic equilibrium of nucleosome disassembly and reassembly."</p><p>With support from the Pew Scholarship, Boeger plans to further investigate this process, trying to understand the mechanisms involved and to what extent it is a general phenomenon in gene regulation.</p><p>Unlike many traditional research grants with strict guidelines on how funds must be used, the Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical Sciences allows recipients flexibility in choosing their research agenda and, in fact, encourages them to become entrepreneurs by taking calculated risks and following unanticipated leads to maximize the benefits their research brings to society. The program was launched to provide crucial support to researchers in the early- to mid-stages of their careers.</p><p>Boeger earned his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in biology from Christian-Albrechts University in Kiel, Germany. He conducted his Ph.D. work in the laboratory of Peter Gruss at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Goettingen, Germany. After a postdoctoral position at Stanford University, Boeger joined the UCSC faculty in 2006.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Boeger at (831) 459-4487 or boeger@biology.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91525fcd8072704601a012fff6feb036"><name>1400</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Class of 2007 makes it official in weekend commencement exercises</title><summary>The campus was a sea of celebration over the weekend--with some pomp and circumstance for good measure--as the Class of 2007 graduated.</summary><keywords>graduation, commencement</keywords><description>The campus was a sea of celebration over the weekend--with some pomp and circumstance for good measure--as the Class of 2007 graduated.</description><start-date>1182150000000</start-date><display-name>Class of 2007 makes...</display-name><path>/2007/06/1400</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/06/1400</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338348952</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338348952</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/06/images/gradgroup1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/06/images/gradgroup1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gradgroup1.jpg</name><file-size>32512</file-size><width>300</width><height>254</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Graduate students celebrate their new status after their Friday ceremony.

(Photo: Todd Tsukushi, 1986)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Brian James Walton, whose leadership of the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group was highlighted by the pivotal role the group played in the restoration of the peregrine falcon on the West Coast, died of a stroke on June 15 at a Santa Cruz hospital. Walton, who served as the coordinator of the University of California, Santa Cruz program for 31 years, was 55.</p>
<p>"Brian was a respected and dedicated individual with a lifelong passion for falcons," said Gary Griggs, director of UC Santa Cruz's Institute of Marine Sciences and a colleague of Walton's for the past three decades. "His and his research group's work on raptor recovery, conservation, and study will benefit these amazing birds for decades to come."</p>
<p>Walton, who first began studying peregrine falcons while a high school student in the Southern California city of Manhattan Beach, participated in the first California peregrine falcon survey in 1970. That survey found only two successfully nesting pairs of falcons remaining in California.</p>
<p>The culprit was discovered to be the compound DDT, considered to be a safe and effective agricultural insecticide in the 1940s, '50s, and '60s. Accumulating in the fatty tissue of peregrines, DDT acted to "block" the movement of calcium during eggshell formation. With abnormally thin eggshells, the species' eggs broke and peregrine embryos died at an alarming rate. In 1972, the federal government banned the compound.</p>
<p>Recruited by SCPBRG's two founders Ken Norris, a professor of natural history at UCSC, and Jim Roush, a Santa Cruz orthopedic veterinarian, Walton coordinated the work of field biologists and oversaw the program's breeding activities; he also became the face of the SCPBRG, speaking tirelessly of the peregrine's plight and leading fundraising efforts to support the recovery. During the height of the program's peregrine falcon captive breeding and management activities, SCPBRG employed more than 50 permanent and seasonal staff per year. These included students and other temporary employees who camped out for weeks or months to observe nest and staff-made "hack" sites.</p>
<p>In order to salvage thin-shelled wild eggs that would likely be broken by the incubating adults, program personnel climbed to their eyries, substituted dummy eggs for the thin-shelled eggs, and hatched as many eggs as possible in the SCPBRG laboratory.</p>
<p>The program's recovery efforts also proved to be a popular attraction at its original location in UCSC's Lower Quarry, as scientists, bird lovers, and the general public toured the facilities for a look at a hands-on endangered species recovery program.</p>
<p>In 1999, the peregrine falcon, nearly extinct two decades earlier, became one of the few endangered species to be "delisted"--removed from the endangered species list--by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Last year, SCPBRG staff conducted a statewide census of peregrines in California and documented 179 active nest territories.</p>
<p>In addition to its peregrine falcon work, the SCPBRG under Walton's leadership has been involved in research in captive breeding and wildlife management of eagles, condors, and other rare or endangered raptors. The program is now located at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory.</p>
<p>In 2004, Walton was honored as an Audubon champion at the annual Audubon California awards luncheon in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Walton earned degrees in biological sciences from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo (bachelor's), and San Jose State University (master's).</p>
<p>"Brian's life, which was defined by tremendous accomplishment, was even more meaningful as he overcame diabetes thanks to successful pancreas and kidney transplants in the early 1990s," said his brother, Ron Walton.</p>
<p>A public memorial service for Walton will take place June 30 at 11 a.m. at the Santa Cruz High School baseball field. Walton's other passion was baseball, having served as a coach in the school's baseball program for almost 10 years.</p>
<p>Walton's survivors include his wife, Hollis Feurtado of Santa Cruz; a son, Neil Walton of Santa Cruz; a daughter, Eleanor Walton of Santa Cruz; a father, James Walton, and a brother, Ron Walton, both of Arroyo Grande, California; former wife, Cheryl Walton of Santa Cruz; and three stepchildren, Peter, Fallon, and Katie Feurtado of Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to the Brian James Walton Memorial Fund. The fund is managed by the Bank of America; donations should be mailed to 849 Almar Avenue, Suite C, Box 332, Santa Cruz, CA 95060.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915263608072704601a012ff834cc4a1"><name>1402</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus facilities, offices switch to summer hours</title><summary>Many UCSC offices and facilities have more limited hours during the summer.</summary><author>Louise Donahue (831) 459-2495; ldonahue@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>summer hours</keywords><description>Many UCSC offices and facilities have more limited hours during the summer.</description><start-date>1182150000000</start-date><display-name>Campus facilities, offices switch...</display-name><path>/2007/06/1402</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/06/1402</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338349876</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338349876</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Louise Donahue</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-5312</phone><email>ldonahue@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Many UCSC offices and facilities have more limited hours during the summer.

There were 24 students in the class--the maximum enrollment set for the course.</p><p>"Our two-unit course, open to all students, was designed to promote awareness, exchange information in meaningful dialogue, hone multicultural skills, and evoke passion in areas of social justice and diversity," said Moise.</p><p>For the final project, students developed hypothetical campus interventions to encourage dialogue or advance social justice initiatives in the community. "With guidance and advising from our top-level college administrators and faculty, many of the proposed student interventions were brought to fruition during spring quarter," Tran said.</p><p>"Some of the projects our students implemented subsequent to the course include a wall of oppression in the Cowell/Stevenson dining hall, a t-shirt-making event to highlight expressions of homophobia, and the conversion of one of our study lounges into a diversity library housing over $1,000 worth of books and student artwork," Tran added.</p><p>The course is expected to be taught again in winter quarter and in spring quarter 2008 as an extension of the service learning component.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915267818072704601a012ffb3e16018"><name>1405</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>TAPS 2007-08 Parking and Program Renewals</title><start-date>1182322800000</start-date><display-name>TAPS 2007-08 Parking and...</display-name><path>/2007/06/1405</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/06/1405</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338350908</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338350908</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Final discussions on 2007-08 parking permit and bus pass rates are still underway.
