A new program developed at the University of California, Santa Cruz, aims to help with the problem by color-coding an entry's individual phrases based on contributors' past performance.</p>
<p>The program analyzes Wikipedia's entire editing history--nearly two million pages and some 40 million edits for the English-language site alone--to estimate the trustworthiness of each page. It then shades the text in deepening hues of orange to signal dubious content. A 1,000-page demonstration version is already available on a web page operated by the program's creator, Luca de Alfaro, associate professor of computer engineering at UCSC.</p>
<p>Other sites already employ user ratings as a measure of reliability, but they typically depend on users' feedback about each other. This method makes the ratings vulnerable to grudges and subjectivity. The new program takes a radically different approach, using the longevity of the content itself to learn what information is useful and which contributors are the most reliable.</p>
<p>"The idea is very simple," de Alfaro said. "If your contribution lasts, you gain reputation. If your contribution is reverted [to the previous version], your reputation falls." De Alfaro will speak about his new program this Saturday, August 4, at the Wikimania conference in Taipei, Taiwan.</p>
<p>The program works from a user's history of edits to calculate his or her reputation score. The trustworthiness of newly inserted text is computed as a function of the reputation of its author. As subsequent contributors vet the text, their own reputations contribute to the text's trustworthiness score. So an entry created by an unknown author can quickly gain (or lose) trust after a few known users have reviewed the pages.</p>
<p>A benefit of calculating author reputation in this way is that de Alfaro can test how well his reliability scores work. He does so by comparing users' reliability scores with how long their subsequent edits last on the site. So far, the program flags as suspect more than 80 percent of edits that turn out to be poor. It's not overly accusatory, either: 60 to 70 percent of the edits it flags do end up being quickly corrected by the Wikipedia community.</p>
<p>The exhaustive analysis of Wikipedia's seven-year edit history takes de Alfaro's desktop PC about a week to complete. At present he is working from copies of the site that Wikipedia periodically distributes. Once the initial backlog of edits is calculated, however, de Alfaro said that updating reliability scores in real time should be fairly simple.</p>
<p>While the program prominently displays text trustworthiness, de Alfaro favors keeping hidden the reputation ratings of individual users. Displaying reputations could lead to competitiveness that would detract from Wikipedia's collaborative culture, he said, and could demoralize knowledgeable contributors whose scores remain low simply because they post infrequently and on few topics.</p>
<p>"We didn't want to modify the experience of a user going in to Wikipedia," de Alfaro said. "It is very relaxing right now and we didn't want to modify what has worked so well and is so welcoming to the new user."</p>
<p>De Alfaro's color-coded Wikipedia pages can be found on his <a href="http://trust.cse.ucsc.edu/">demonstration site</a>.</p>

<p>The new season kicks off on Sunday, October 7, with Daniel Beaty's "Emergence-See," a provocative one-man show of slam poetry, theater and song, in which Beaty portrays a cast of 40 characters who offer a stirring commentary on modern black life. This solo tour-de-force was honored in May with a 2007 Village Voice Obie Award for Outstanding Writing and Performance.</p>
<p>Ravi Shankar graces the stage of the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium on November 4, with the esteemed musician, composer and performer accompanied by an ensemble of world-class musicians led by his daughter, Anoushka Shankar. And on November 16, Caetano Veloso will bring to Santa Cruz his innovative mix of Brazilian pop, rock, bossa nova and tango fusion for a show that will be presented with Kuumbwa Jazz Center. Described by Rolling Stone as "the most influential Brazilian artist of his generation," Veloso has toured and collaborated with such luminaries as Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa, and Maria Bethania.</p>
<p>African pop star Youssou N'Dour takes over the Rio Theatre on November 28 with his infectious blend of African and Caribbean rhythms. Hailed as "the best known African musician in the world" by the BBC, N'Dour has collaborated with Peter Gabriel, Sting, Paul Simon and Wyclef Jean, and received a Grammy for Best Contemporary World Music Album for his 2004 release, <em>Egypt.</em> This show will be presented in conjunction with Pulse Productions.</p>
<p>The lineup also features 27-year-old Grammy award-winning violinist Hilary Hahn in concert at the UCSC Recital Hall on October 17. Hahn can be heard as featured soloist on the Oscar-nominated soundtrack to M. Night Shyamalan's feature film, <em>The Village.</em> Other classical concerts include the critically acclaimed Borromeo String Quartet on February 24; and The Romeros--described by the <em>New York Times</em> as "the only classical guitar quartet of real stature in the world today"--on April 11.</p>
<p>On the dance front, UCSC Arts &amp; Lectures will present an evening with Ailey II--the brilliant company founded by legendary choreographer Alvin Ailey--on February 11. Ailey II merges the energy of the country's best young dance talent with the creative vision of today's most innovative emerging choreographers. Hawaii's Kahekili Dance Company will also present a hula drama featuring traditional dance, music and storytelling from Maui on February 23; and Ballet Folklorico Quetzalli de Veracruz offers a visual fiesta featuring the dazzling costumes and irresistible rhythms of old Mexico on April 25.</p>
<p>Other highlights of the season include a collaboration between the haunting vocal quartet Anonymous 4 and virtuoso instrumentalists Darol Anger (violin) and Scott Nygaard (guitar) at the UCSC Recital Hall on January 25; Music From the Crooked Road, a national tour of old-time, bluegrass, mountain and Gospel music that will be presented with Snazzy Productions on October 25; a one-man show by Emmy Award-winning actor Joe Spano exploring the life of R. Buckminster Fuller on March 14; and Sierra Leone's Refugee All Stars on February 19. Hugh Masekela and the Chissa All-Stars perform on February 5; and best-selling author and host of NPR's <em>Weekend Edition Saturday,</em> Scott Simon, will speak on April 21.</p>

</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Yi Zuo's innovative research on the nervous system has attracted funding from three major foundations since her arrival at the University of California, Santa Cruz, in January. The Ellison Medical Foundation and the American Federation for Aging Research (AFAR) are the most recent organizations to award research grants to Zuo, an assistant professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology. Earlier this year, she was one of three UCSC faculty members selected to receive research fellowships from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation (see <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1067">story</a>).</p>
<p>Zuo will receive $200,000 over four years as an Ellison Medical Foundation New Scholar in Aging, and the AFAR award will provide an additional $60,000 in funding. The grants support Zuo's research on changes in the nervous system related to aging. In particular, she is interested in the interaction between two types of cells in the nervous system: neurons and glia. Although glia outnumber neurons, scientists are only beginning to understand the roles they play in the neural circuitry.</p>
<p>"Any information we can learn about the role of glia is very useful, because so little is known about them," Zuo said.</p>
<p>Her lab is investigating the interaction between neurons and glia at the synapses, the specialized junctions through which neurons communicate with each other and with other cell types, such as those in muscles and glands. Structural changes and functional declines are known to occur at synapses in both normal aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Changes in the glial cells may be an important factor in age-related changes in synapses, Zuo said.</p>
<p>The two new grants will support a research program focusing on the simplest synapse in the nervous system, the neuromuscular junction, which connects motor neurons and muscle cells. Zuo uses sophisticated microscopic imaging techniques that enable her to observe individual neuromuscular junctions in living mice repeatedly over the life span of the mouse. This technique allows the researchers in Zuo's lab to monitor the same neuromuscular synapse and its associated glia during the aging process.</p>
<p>"We will examine the dynamic nature of the synapse and the sequence of events that lead to aging-related structural changes in neuromuscular junctions, and determine if glial changes lead to synaptic changes," Zuo said.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the insights gained from this research could lead to the identification of glia as a novel therapeutic target in dealing with problems associated with the aging neuromuscular system.</p>
<p>Zuo earned her B.S. in biology at Tsinghua University in Beijing and her Ph.D. in neuroscience at Northwestern University. Before joining the UCSC faculty, she held postdoctoral positions at New York University and the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p>The Ellison Medical Foundation supports basic biomedical research on aging relevant to understanding life-span development processes and age-related diseases and disabilities. The American Federation for Aging Research supports the science of healthier aging, funding research on the fundamental mechanisms of aging by providing start-up grants to scientists early in their careers.</p>

Haussler, a professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, has been a HHMI investigator since 2000.</p><p>A pioneer in the field of bioinformatics, Haussler is developing new statistical and algorithmic methods to explore the molecular evolution of the human genome. His Genome Bioinformatics Group participates in the public consortium efforts to produce, assemble, and annotate the first mammalian genomes. The group designed and built the program that assembled the first working draft of the human genome sequence from information produced by sequencing centers worldwide.

The Haussler laboratory has also identified genome segments that have undergone unusually rapid change in one species, such as a gene linked to brain development that has changed dramatically between chimpanzees and humans (see <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/06-07/08-28/gene.asp">earlier story</a>).</p><p>HHMI, a nonprofit medical research organization, advances biomedical research and science education in the United States and ranks as one of the nation's largest philanthropies.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915299e78072704601a012ffccaecd79"><name>1477</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Chemist Phil Crews earns Research Achievement Award</title><summary>The American Society of Pharmacognosy (ASP) has selected Phil Crews, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, to receive the 2008 ASP Research Achievement Award.

Since it was founded in 1982, the members of the WHA have been instrumental in establishing standards for teaching world history at the national and state levels, as well as designing the AP World History course.</p><p>The UCSC students presented two panels on "Social Biography as World History," an approach to world history that links the lives of ordinary individuals with the broader contexts within which they emerged. The panels were based on a project initiated in Burke's graduate seminar, "Patterns of World History."</p><p>"Social biography is an attempt to understand the trajectories of ordinary people's lives through the systematic application of the research strategies of social history and the encompassing vision of world history," said Burke. "By reading the facts of these lives through the lens of world history, social biographies cast new light on the standard world historical narrative, with its emphasis on large-scale change."</p><p>Burke added that models of social biographies for classroom and university teachers are now available on the UCSC Center for World History web site in a new, updated "Teaching Resources" section <a href="http://cwh.ucsc.edu">click here</a>.</p><p>The web site also includes a new globalized model curriculum for college-level survey courses in U.S. history that UCSC graduate students introduced at last year's WHA conference in Los Angeles. That project was the result of the collaboration of more than a dozen UCSC graduate students of world history over an 18-month period. It features a syllabus for each of the two parts of the U.S. history lower-division survey course, along with lecture titles and assigned readings. There is also an instructor's syllabus that outlines each lecture, as well as a bibliography to guide the instructor's preparation.</p><p>Burke also noted that a third project-"Commodities as an Approach to World History"--has been added to the Teaching Resources section of the site. It features models of student research that trace the role of commodities such as coffee against the backdrop of a changing world.</p><p>UCSC graduate student presenters at the WHA conference included Urmi Engineer, Anders Otterness, Eliza Martin, Kevin McDonald, Maia Ramnath, and Martin Renner, plus Alexandra Haugh and Rick Warner, who previously received Ph.D.s in history from the campus.</p><p>For more information, contact Edmund Burke III, director of the UCSC Center for World History, at (831) 459-2287.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91529dcc8072704601a012ffe5957928"><name>1479</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Vanpools have openings for riders, drivers</title><summary>Members of the campus community looking for commuting alternatives can now take advantage of several vanpool openings.</summary><description>Members of the campus community looking for commuting alternatives can now take advantage of several vanpool openings.</description><start-date>1186988400000</start-date><display-name>Vanpools have openings for...</display-name><path>/2007/08/1479</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/08/1479</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338364821</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338364821</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Members of the campus community looking for commuting alternatives can now take advantage of several vanpool openings.</p><p>Vanpools with space for passengers and drivers are:</p><p>.

Merrill Trust donated $650,000 toward the construction of the college. That fall, Merrill College opened to its first class of students.</p>
<p>Bell was not only considered a very capable administrator, he was a devoted teacher who inspired students at UCSC and on many other campuses, including UC Berkeley, Haverford College, Fisk University, Lincoln University, and Boston University.</p>
<p>He was also an accomplished economist. The co-author of <em>The Theory and Measurement of Business Income</em> (1961), which influenced generations of accounting scholars, Bell was inducted into the Accounting Hall of Fame in 2003. During a very distinguished career, he was the author of 12 books and monographs and more than 30 articles.</p>

Blumenthal issued the following statement today, following <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/dynes/pressrelease.html">Robert C. Dynes' announcement that he will be stepping down as UC president during the coming academic year</a>:</p><p>"When Bob Dynes was named president of the University of California more than four years ago, he pledged to sustain UC's well-deserved reputation for both quality and access. He kept his promise with both vision and action. Whether it was launching a science-math teacher-training program for California, a long-range planning blueprint for UC, or an international research collaboration, he has advanced our thinking about the critical role that the University plays in the development of society. During often-challenging budget discussions and deliberations, he has reminded California's legislative leaders of the relationship between investing in UC now and forging a better tomorrow, and he negotiated an agreement with the Governor that both stabilized and improved UC's budget. And he's been particularly effective in demonstrating to the state's educational and business leaders that the University of California is a valuable asset, owned by each and every Californian. I consider it both a privilege and an honor to know and work with President Dynes."</p><p><hr/></p><p>Acting Chancellor Blumenthal has worked closely with President Dynes in two capacities:</p><p>. As Chair of the UC systemwide Academic Senate, during the 2004-05 year.</p><p>. As Acting Chancellor of UC's Santa Cruz campus, since July 2006.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9152a3988072704601a012ff273ffb12"><name>1484</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Administrative appointments and assignments</title><summary>Now that summer is here, it feels as if the campus's pace has slowed a bit and we are taking time to catch our breath after a busy and productive academic year.

Despite appearances, I know that faculty and staff are working hard to support our many summer activities, as well as preparing to welcome new students who will be arriving next month. Work continues in my office as well, and I write today to keep you informed on several administrative changes taking place:</p>
<p>In August of 2005 I had the pleasure of appointing Professor Carl Walsh to the position of Vice Provost for Silicon Valley Initiatives. Vice Provost Walsh has served admirably in this role. He has provided excellent leadership to our Silicon Valley programs during his two-year tenure, advancing our activities at the Silicon Valley site in a number of areas, including interim senior management responsibility for University Extension. He has made the decision to return to his research and teaching responsibilities in the Department of Economics and his term as Vice Provost will be ending August 31. Please join with me in thanking Carl for his outstanding service to the campus and his many contributions to the Silicon Valley Center.</p>
<p>A search is now underway to appoint a successor to Vice Provost Walsh. Vice Chancellor Bruce Margon has been appointed to chair the search committee. I look forward to receiving the report of the search committee and finalizing an appointment in the near future.</p>
<p>In response to this transition in leadership, Chancellor Blumenthal and I are pleased to announce the following appointments and administrative assignments:</p>

<ul>
<li style="list-style: none">

</li>
<li>Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Alison Galloway has assumed responsibility for the administration of University Extension. Oversight of this program will be included within her responsibilities in the Office of Academic Affairs. As Vice Provost for Academic Affairs, Alison is among the principal academic advisors to the Campus Provost, and her office is responsible for campus academic administration, including coordination and implementation of campus academic planning, review of academic programs, resource allocation, and academic personnel processes.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Professor of Economics Nirvikar Singh will serve a one-year appointment as Special Advisor to the Chancellor for the School of Management. Nirvikar joined the UCSC faculty in 1982. He has served as the Undergraduate Programs Director for the Department of Economics and as codirector of the Santa Cruz Institute of International Economics. As Special Advisor to the Chancellor he will continue the work of assessing the feasibility of a School of Management and finalizing a program proposal for campus review. An immediate focus will be to continue discussions with the Jack Baskin School of Engineering and Carnegie Mellon West to explore opportunities to leverage the presence of both institutions at the NASA Research Park through integrated course offerings.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Lynda Rogers has been appointed to the position of Assistant Vice Provost for Silicon Valley Initiatives, effective July 1, 2007. As Assistant Vice Provost, she will serve as the senior staff member to the Vice Provost, overseeing the academic and administrative affairs of the office. Her responsibilities will include furthering the instructional, research, and administrative goals at the Silicon Valley Center and providing policy direction in areas of program growth and development, public information, internal and external relations. Lynda was formerly the Executive Director of the UC Online Academy. Prior to joining UC she was a science educator, serving as the Science and Technology Coordinator for the Santa Cruz County Office of Education, as a consultant for the California Department of Education and as a teacher for the San Lorenzo Valley Unified School District.

Doyle is best known as the founder and longtime director of the Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS). Among California botanists, however, he is known as the leading authority on the state's liverworts and hornworts, small nonflowering land plants related to mosses.</p><p>A professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology, Doyle has now published a comprehensive reference on the liverworts and hornworts of California, including detailed descriptions of all the known species and keys to their identification. Coauthored by Raymond Stotler of Southern Illinois University, it is the first such catalogue to be published since 1899; it appears in the April-June issue of the botanical journal <i>Madroño</i>.</p><p>Doyle began studying liverworts and hornworts early in his career and took them up again after retiring as IMS director in 1991. The study of these small, inconspicuous plants requires "an innate appreciation for things small and a willingness to spend time to seek them out," Doyle wrote in the introduction to the <i>Madroño</i> article.</p><p>"They're the plants people kneel on to take pictures of flowers," he said. Viewed up close, however, they can be quite beautiful, with striking features such as spore-bearing structures that look like tiny umbrellas.</p><p>"They are very old, simple land plants," Doyle said. "In the Devonian and Carboniferous periods [more than 300 million years ago], there were liverworts that look almost identical to the ones we see today."</p><p>Doyle's interests include not only the plants themselves, but also their natural habitats. His field studies have taken him to every corner of the state.</p><p>"When I was on the faculty, I didn't have much time to do field work, but after I retired I decided to have some fun exploring California's tremendously diverse habitats," he said. "I realized that these plants have not been well studied in California."</p><p>Staying in campgrounds and taking day hikes and backpacking trips to remote locations to collect specimens, Doyle has put 283,000 miles on his Ford Explorer in just the past seven years. At age 78, he shows no signs of slowing down, although he acknowledged that a 12.4-mile day hike in Yosemite this summer "took a lot out of me."</p><p>Mosses, liverworts, and hornworts are known collectively as bryophytes, and those who study them are bryologists. The new publication was suggested by two bryologists who were documenting the mosses of California and urged Doyle to write up the information he was collecting on liverworts and hornworts. He tried to make the catalogue accessible not only to professional bryologists but also to students and amateurs. His coauthor, an expert in the taxonomy of bryophytes, helped with the identification and naming of the specimens and the descriptions of new species.</p><p>"I have all the fun, doing the field work, and he does a lot of the library research," said Doyle, who is currently helping to document the bryophyte flora of Yosemite National Park and finishing work on a bryophyte flora of Pinnacles National Monument.</p><p>"Agencies such as the National Park Service are increasingly interested in knowing all the plants and animals that are under their jurisdiction and whether any of them are in need of protection," he said. "There are many bryophytes that grow only in California or on the West Coast."</p><p>Bryophytes, like ferns, reproduce by spores rather than seeds. "The one-celled spores of liverworts and hornworts can be both spectacularly beautiful and distinctive for the species," Doyle said.</p><p>He has been using the scanning electron microscope (SEM) in UCSC's Microscopy and Imaging Laboratory to examine and document the diversity of bryophyte spores, with the help of lab director Jonathan Krupp. Because SEM photos of spores are so helpful in identifying species, Doyle contributes his photos to a <a href="http://www.csun.edu/%7Ehcbio028">web site</a> where they are readily available to researchers and students.</p><p>After getting "sidetracked in administration" at UCSC, where he had an enormous influence on the campus and its marine science programs, Doyle is clearly enjoying his return to the botanical subjects that originally interested him.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9152a6db8072704601a012fff73c7f2a"><name>1486</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>CruzMail Stabilization Update</title><summary>I write to provide you with an update on our ongoing work on the CruzMail stabilization project.

Our goal is to provide you with a more robust and stable email system, fully capable of providing the email service you expect.</p><p>Since May, the CruzMail project team has interviewed seven academic campuses. This fact-finding process revealed key differences in network and storage design compared to UC Santa Cruz. Based on that information, we completed an analysis of our current email system architecture: servers, network, storage, test environment, and software. We were then able to develop a set of best practices that we are using to help guide our choices for the project deliverables.</p><p>Consequently, we selected new server, storage, and network equipment that will provide enough capacity and performance for the next several years. These higher performing servers are currently undergoing testing in the Data Center prior to deployment next month.</p><p>In addition to all the technical back-end work, we developed a CruzMail change control process to minimize unplanned outages. Since this process has been in place, we have implemented five changes to the CruzMail system without causing any unplanned outages or subsequent problems thereby greatly improving email availability.</p><p>In our efforts to continue reducing the amount of SPAM the campus receives, we have added new industry-standard blacklists to the existing SPAM and Anti-virus scanners. With the introduction of these new features, we immediately saw a 50% reduction in SPAM and a 90% reduction in virus-laden email.</p><p>Over the next several months, the CruzMail stabilization project team will focus efforts on publishing a Campus Service Level Agreement for CruzMail that defines the elements of the service with goals for uptime and response time, as well as a set of metrics to gauge performance. In addition, we will continue to make improvements to the network and convert over to the new CruzMail architecture, resulting in a stable and dependable campus service. We are also working on changes to the way potential SPAM messages are handled and on updating existing email policies.</p><p>Thank you for your patience throughout the CruzMail stabilization project.

Since it was founded in 1982, the members of the WHA have been instrumental in establishing standards for teaching world history at the national and state levels, as well as designing the AP World History course. </p><p>The UCSC students presented two panels on "Social Biography as World History," an approach to world history that links the lives of ordinary individuals with the broader contexts within which they emerged. The panels were based on a project initiated in Burke's graduate seminar, "Patterns of World History." </p><p>"Social biography is an attempt to understand the trajectories of ordinary people's lives through the systematic application of the research strategies of social history and the encompassing vision of world history," said Burke. "By reading the facts of these lives through the lens of world history, social biographies cast new light on the standard world historical narrative, with its emphasis on large-scale change."</p><p>Burke added that models of social biographies for classroom and university teachers are now available on the UCSC Center for World History web site in a new, updated "Teaching Resources" section <a href="http://cwh.ucsc.edu">click here</a> </p><p>The web site also includes a new globalized model curriculum for college-level survey courses in U.S. history that UCSC graduate students introduced at last year's WHA conference in Los Angeles. That project was the result of the collaboration of more than a dozen UCSC graduate students of world history over an 18-month period. It features a syllabus for each of the two parts of the U.S. history lower-division survey course, along with lecture titles and assigned readings. There is also an instructor's syllabus that outlines each lecture, as well as a bibliography to guide the instructor's preparation. </p><p>Burke also noted that a third project--"Commodities as an Approach to World History"--has been added to the Teaching Resources section of the site. It features models of student research that trace the role of commodities such as coffee against the backdrop of a changing world. </p><p>UCSC graduate student presenters at the WHA conference included Urmi Engineer, Anders Otterness, Eliza Martin, Kevin McDonald, Maia Ramnath, and  Martin Renner, plus Alexandra Haugh and Rick Warner, who previously received Ph.D.s in history from the campus. </p><p>For more information, contact Edmund Burke III, director of the UCSC Center for World History, at (831) 459-2287.</p><p>							</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9152b14a8072704601a012ff61be2942"><name>1514</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>OPERS staff member Kevin Givens honored for contributions to sport</title><summary>Kevin ("Skippy") Givens, OPERS intramural and sports club director, recently received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Freestyle Frisbee Players Association.</summary><keywords>givens, Frisbee, OPERS</keywords><description>Kevin ("Skippy") Givens, OPERS intramural and sports club director, recently received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Freestyle Frisbee Players Association.</description><start-date>1188198000000</start-date><display-name>OPERS staff member Kevin...</display-name><path>/2007/08/1514</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/08/1514</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338369801</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338369801</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Kevin ("Skippy") Givens, OPERS intramural and sports club director, recently received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Freestyle Frisbee Players Association.</p><p>Presented at the Freestyle Frisbee World Championship in Amsterdam earlier this summer, the new award recognizes long-lasting contributions to the sport of Freestyle Frisbee.

Researchers found that two other bacteria, including a species that attacks plants, sense light using the same type of protein structure, and at least 94 more species possess the code for it in their DNA.</p>
<p>"These bacteria have been very well studied for years, and no one knew they could sense light," said lead author Trevor Swartz, who initiated the study as a research scientist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "Now it seems like it's a common thing rather than being an anomaly."</p>
<p>The ubiquity of the structure suggests that light may play a much more important role in bacterial life than has previously been recognized. And because the recurrent structure can be paired with a variety of signaling proteins, it gives organisms immense versatility in the ways they use light, Swartz said.</p>
<p>"We have bumped into an entirely new family of light receptors in nature," said coauthor Roberto Bogomolni, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC.</p>
<p>The receptor molecule contains a light-sensing region known as an LOV domain because it resembles similar units in other proteins that sense light, oxygen, or voltage, said coauthor and longtime collaborator Winslow Briggs, of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The structure crops up in a variety of proteins, where it lends its light-sensing ability to the whole molecule. The light-sensing structure is very different from either the light-harvesting molecules of photosynthesis or the light-gathering pigments in our own eyes.</p>
<p>LOV domains were discovered 10 years ago in plant molecules called phototropins. The molecules enable plants to do crucial tasks, such as growing toward light and sensing day length. Why so many bacteria should possess the same type of equipment has been harder to understand.</p>
<p>To pin down the LOV domain's light-sensing function in bacteria, researchers selected four species whose DNA contained genes for the structure: <em>Brucella melitensis, B. abortus, Pseudomonas syringae</em> (a well-studied plant pathogen), and <em>Erythrobacter litoralis,</em> a common bacterium in sea water. They spliced the genes into <em>Escherichia coli,</em> a lab-friendly bacterium that is easy to work with.</p>
<p>Then they grew the bacteria in a darkened lab and tracked molecular activity with radioactive tracers. When flashed with a strobe light, the LOV domains immediately changed shape, forming a temporary bond in a process that Bogomolni likened to the opening of a hinge. When open, the hinge exposes the rest of the protein and activates it. When darkness returns, the bonds break and the LOV domain swings shut.</p>
<p>The light-receptor protein includes an enzyme called histidine kinase that, when exposed by activation of the LOV domain, marks other molecules using phosphate as a tag. A second component of the signaling system, called a response regulator, relays the signal to the rest of the cell by transferring the phosphate tag to other molecules.</p>
<p>The secret to the versatility of such two-component systems lies in the variety of molecules available to be tagged. For example, even though LOV domains are nearly identical between plants and bacteria, the subsequent signaling steps are completely different, said Swartz, who is now a researcher at Genentech.</p>
<p>When Brucella comes under attack from a host's immune system, light received by the LOV domain activates the bacterium's counter-defenses, allowing it to reproduce rapidly and making it highly virulent. In the dark, without these defenses activated, Brucella's division rate drops by 90 percent. When the team grew experimental Brucella in the light but with the LOV domain disabled, they found an identical drop in division rate.</p>
<p>Swartz and Bogomolni are still not sure how the regulation of virulence by light benefits the pathogen. They suspect that it allows the bacterium to determine when it is outside of its host--such as when a cow's infected fetus has been aborted and is lying in the field. By increasing its virulence under those circumstances, the bacteria are more likely to survive and infect a new host.</p>
<p>Understanding how bacteria respond to light could lead to therapeutic advances. For example, histidine kinases are unknown in animals. So, if a drug were developed that could disable histidine kinase activity, it could fight bacteria without causing side effects in animals, Bogomolni said.</p>
<p>"We are beginning to understand what we like to call the molecular calisthenics that go on," Bogomolni said. "But we still don't know what is happening at the cellular level, and that will require years of research to find out."</p>
<p>In addition to Swartz, Bogomolni, and Briggs, the paper's authors include Marcus Frederickson, a UCSC graduate student; Tong-Seung Tseng of the Carnegie Institution of Washington; GastÃ³n Paris and Fernando Goldbaum of the Leloir Institute Foundation at CONICET, Argentina; Diego Comerci and Rodolfo Ugalde of the National University of San MartÃ­n, Argentina; Gireesh Rajashekara and Gary Splitter of the University of Wisconsin; and Jung-Gun Kim and Mary Beth Mudgett of Stanford University.</p>

The assessment will identify practical ways to store and use reclaimed water in new campus development. It complements another UCSC analysis--a six-month study of water efficiency throughout the campus--which is nearing completion.</p>
<p>"The campus remains very committed to conserving water and reducing loss or waste wherever possible," said Frank Zwart, campus architect. "With completion of the water efficiency analysis, we are turning our attention to exploring new and innovative practices for reclaiming and recycling water."</p>
<p>Steve Paul, the campus engineer who will oversee the feasibility study for the water reclamation and recycling project, noted that reclaiming water is emerging as a standard practice in California. "Many water districts in the state are turning to reclaimed water to bolster the supply side of the water balance equation," he said.</p>
<p>Sources of reclaimed water could include rainwater, gray water (household water from sinks, showers, or baths), cooling tower wastewater, and treated water from the sanitary sewer. Reclaimed water can be used for building cooling, irrigation, and toilet flushing.</p>
<p>The study will assess the potential for reclaimed water use on campus and present a plan to use reclaimed water in new development. It will also take a close look at the potential for recycled water to assist in meeting the campus's existing summer demand for irrigation and building cooling. Summer is a critical period each year because the City of Santa Cruz water system is most vulnerable to water shortages at that time.</p>
<p>The study, which is expected to be completed by June 2008, will also include an implementation schedule for such a program.</p>
<p>The campus's water use, which represents about 5 percent of the demand from the Santa Cruz Water Department, is reflective of an agressive conservation effort that has been in place for approximately two decades. Since 1986, per-capita water usage on campus has been reduced by 36 percent. In fact, UCSC used only 19 percent more water in 2003 than it did in 1986.</p>
<p>The campus has nearly completed the water efficiency study in which nearly 300 buildings and over 5,000 plumbing fixtures have been surveyed.</p>
<p>"This most recent study identified areas where there is still room for improvement for water conservation," Paul said. For example, the efficiency study has inventoried several hundred toilets installed before 1994 that met the standard of 3.5 gallons per flush at the time, but are not meeting today's new-construction standard of 1.6 gallons per flush.</p>
<p>The survey team is currently assessing high-use facilities in order to determine priorities and develop an implementation program for retrofitting plumbing fixtures to meet current water conservation standards.</p>

The TMT is being developed by a U.S.-Canadian team, with construction anticipated to begin in April 2009. The new grants augment the $64 million already planned for the design development phase of the TMT project, which included $35 million previously awarded to UC and Caltech by the Moore Foundation.</p>
<p>With the TMT, astronomers will be able to analyze the light from the first stars born after the Big Bang, directly observe the formation and evolution of galaxies, see planets around nearby stars, and make observations that test fundamental laws of physics.</p>
<p>"This new award from the Moore Foundation will enable us to reach construction readiness and will also initiate industrial production capabilities for the primary segments of the telescope," said project manager Gary Sanders.</p>
<p>The TMT is now at the stage of detailed design. When completed it will be the world's largest telescope. It consists of a primary mirror with 492 individual 1.45-meter segments that span 30 meters in total, three times the effective diameter of the current largest telescopes. All of the segments will be under precision computer control so that they work together as a single mirror.</p>
<p>The TMT will not only be the largest optical telescope in the world, but will also be at the forefront of technology in virtually every aspect of its design. Adaptive optics (AO) will allow the TMT to achieve a resolution comparable to a space telescope. Because TMT project engineers are integrating this system with the designs for eight science instruments, the power of the AO system should be available at the beginning of the telescope's operations in 2016.</p>
<p>The baseline AO system for the TMT involves six laser beams launched from a small telescope from the top of the structure that supports the telescope's secondary mirror. These laser beams create luminous spots in a layer of sodium atoms high in Earth's upper atmosphere, providing artificial points of light analogous to distant stars. These pointlike laser-illuminated spots drift and wobble just like starlight, giving the AO system reference points to use anywhere in the sky as it compensates for distortions of starlight caused by Earth's fluctuating atmosphere. This technology was pioneered at UC's Lick Observatory and is also used by the Gemini Observatory 8-meter telescopes and the W. M. Keck Observatory 10-meter telescopes.</p>
<p>Much of the TMT's scientific work will be done in the infrared, where the best resolution is easier to attain, young stars and galaxies are to be found, and the opportunities for new discoveries are abundant. The TMT project is studying five high sites in Chile, Hawaii, and Mexico as possible locations for the telescope, with site selection planned for May 2008.</p>
<p>Three reviews by an independent panel evaluated all aspects of the project, including its optical design, the telescope structure and its enclosure, science instrumentation, site testing, management, and cost estimate procedures. The panel reached positive conclusions about the level of design development and the prospect for construction readiness by April 2009.</p>
<p>The TMT is a collaboration of the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., and the Association of Canadian Universities for Research in Astronomy (ACURA), with significant work being done by industry and by university teams studying instrument designs. The project office is in Pasadena, California.</p>

<p>A great first step is to visit the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden's Fall Plant Sale, which will offer gardeners a rich and timely selection of organically raised vegetable seedlings, perennials, and California natives. Sponsored by the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems, the sale takes place on Friday and Saturday, September 7 and 8. The sale will be open from noon to 6 p.m. on Friday, and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday, in the Barn Theater parking lot at the intersection of Bay and High Streets in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"Fall is a great time to plant fast-growing greens and other vegetable crops for late fall and winter harvest," says UCSC Garden manager Christof Bernau. This year's offerings include spinach, kale, lettuce and salad mixes, chard, collards, kale, and leaks, along with broccoli, and cabbage. Annual flowers available this year include sweet peas, larkspur, bachelor buttons, nigella, statice, stock and mignotte, which can be planted in the fall for late winter and spring blooms.</p>
<p>The Farm &amp; Garden's plant sale is one of the largest all-organic events of its kind in the Monterey Bay Area. All of the flower and vegetable starts were propagated using organic methods. No chemical fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides were used in growing the plants from seed. None of the hardwood cuttings were given artificial growth hormones.</p>
<p>In addition to winter vegetables and culinary herbs, the sale will feature perennial flowers and shrubs. Some favorites from this fall's collection include <em>Angelica stricta purpurea,</em> a striking purple-tinged plant much loved by butterflies; <em>Verbascum</em> 'Arctic Summer', a drought-tolerant native of Greece, with tall, white fleecy stems bearing bright yellow flowers; <em>Correa</em> 'Carmine Bells', an Australian perennial with dusky rose tubular flowers that bloom November to April; and from the Channel Islands, the California native <em>Ribes viburnifolium,</em> an evergreen shrub with pendulous clusters of white flowers.</p>
<p>Autumn is also the best time to plant perennial shrubs, including California natives, according Bernau. "Because the soil is still warm, transplants quickly establish strong roots that ensure their survival during the winter," Bernau said. Winter rains will help fall-planted perennials establish deep roots, encouraging colorful blooms and reducing water dependence next spring.</p>
<p>The sale will benefit the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden Apprenticeship, a six-month training course in organic farming and gardening.

Most recently, she has served as the Associate Vice President for Student Engagement at Pennsylvania State University-University Park. In that position, she provided leadership for a comprehensive division of Student Affairs which employed 385 staff and operated with a $40 million budget. She was directly responsible for the areas of Counseling and Psychological Services, Judicial Affairs, the Center for Ethics and Religious Affairs, Fraternity and Sorority Life, the Center for Student Engagement, New Student Programs, and Off Campus Living, Adult Learners, and Special Populations.</p><p>The following press release is being distributed today by our Public Information Office, providing more details about Felicia's impressive credentials:</p><p><a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1520">http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1520</a></p><p>After Felicia's arrival, you can reach her by contacting the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs at 459-2474 or by sending email to Executive Assistant Karen Turinia at <a href="mailto:karent@ucsc.edu">karent@ucsc.edu</a>. Felicia's office will be in Kerr 221.</p><p>We would like to thank the selection committee chaired by William Ladusaw, Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education. The committee conducted a national search for this critical position, and Felicia's appointment is the result of their dedicated efforts.</p><p>We are also very grateful for the leadership that Acting Vice Chancellor Jean Marie Scott provided over the last year to the Division of Student Affairs. Her integrity and unwavering commitment were of utmost importance to the campus as she guided the division during this critical transition period. We are also extremely pleased that Jean Marie will continue to serve the campus as Associate Vice Chancellor of Colleges and University Housing Services.</p><p>Please join us in thanking Jean Marie Scott and welcoming our new colleague, Felicia McGinty.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Acting Chancellor Blumenthal and Campus Provost/EVC Kliger</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9152e0818072704601a012ff1ae5f454"><name>1527</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Statements concerning court ruling regarding LRDP EIR</title><author>Jim Burns (831/459-2495)</author><keywords>LRDP, Long-Range Development Plan</keywords><start-date>1188284400000</start-date><display-name>Statements concerning court ruling...</display-name><path>/2007/08/1527</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/08/1527</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338381901</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338381901</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Kelly Drumm of UC's Office of General Counsel and UCSC Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal issued the following statements today concerning a Santa Cruz County Superior Court ruling regarding UC Santa Cruz's Long-Range Development Plan EIR:</p>
<p><strong>From Kelly Drumm, University Counsel, Office of General Counsel, University of California Regents:</strong><br/>
</p>
<p>While we are pleased that the court dismissed challenges against 13 of the 16 issue categories in the Long-Range Development Plan's EIR, we are disappointed that the judge requested additional environmental analysis in the remaining three issue categories. We will comply with the court's request that we meet and confer in an effort to resolve our differences. But because we strongly dispute the CEQA basis for today's ruling, we are seriously considering appealing the judgment.</p>
<p><strong>From George Blumenthal, UC Santa Cruz Acting Chancellor:</strong><br/>
</p>
<p>Today's ruling was not wholly unexpected by the campus. I note, however, that the judge acknowledged the university's right to grow responsibly to meet the needs of California's students and encouraged the parties to make every effort to resolve this dispute outside of litigation. My personal support for such negotiations is why I and other campus representatives have attempted on multiple occasions to reach agreements with the City and County concerning traffic, housing, and water. We remain committed to working with the community to mitigate our impacts.</p>
