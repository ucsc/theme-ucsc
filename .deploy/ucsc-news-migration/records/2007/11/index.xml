Kim (Photo by Scott Rappaport)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As recently as the early 1970s, very few women in the United States had access to work in newsrooms, press clubs, editorial boards, and radio broadcasting booths. Today, women are employed as writers, producers, anchors, editors, and publishers in nearly every major newspaper, magazine, television network, and radio station across the country.</p>
<p>So writes UC Santa Cruz assistant professor of film and digital media L. S. Kim in the 35th anniversary issue of <em>Ms.</em> magazine, on newsstands now. Kim's feature story traces the impact feminists have had on mainstream media over the past three and a half decades. As Kim notes in the article, "although still grossly underrepresented in many areas, women now often decide what becomes news, what goes on the front page, who is given a voice and which stories form the nation's political and cultural narrative."</p>
<p>The fall special collector's issue of <em>Ms.</em> also includes comments from a wide variety of feminists including Gloria Steinem, Margaret Cho, Whoopi Goldberg, and Billie Jean King, as well as UCSC's professor of community studies B. Ruby Rich and alumna author bell hooks. They each respond to the question of how feminism has changed their lives in the past 35 years and where the movement is headed.</p>
<p>Last year, Kim was asked to join the <em>Ms.</em> magazine Committee of Scholars, made up of 20 professors from universities throughout the country. She said that the non-profit magazine created the advisory group in an effort to reach out to the academic community and provide a forum to bring more attention to feminist issues. Kim recently traveled to Washington, D.C., where the committee met to discuss topics the feminist scholars believe ought to be covered by <em>Ms.</em></p>
<p>"There's no question that there has been a cultural shift to young women not being apt to call themselves feminists," Kim observed. "One question that the committee grappled with is how do we bring feminism to the forefront for a new generation on college campuses-for the next generation of voters."</p>
<p>Kim joined UCSC's Film and Digital Media Department in 2002. Her research areas include television studies, racial discourse, postfeminism, media practices, and social change. Kim's work has appeared in such publications as <em>Television &amp; New Media, Journal of Film and Video, Flow,</em> and <em>Jump Cut</em>.</p>
<p>Kim noted that she was glad to have the opportunity to convey critical questions she studies in academia to a large public audience. She added that <em>Ms.</em> gave her free reign to pick the topic for her article.</p>
<p>"I was interested in the relationship between women and news production--women as journalists on camera, women as subjects of news stories, what stories about women are considered newsworthy, and what difference it makes when women are producers, writers, and executives behind-the-scenes in the production of media," said Kim.</p>
<p>Kim added that many of the classes that she teaches at UCSC--such as <em>Asian Americans in Media</em>--utilize a "gender lens."</p>
<p>"In general, questions of gender exist in culture, so questions of gender exist in media," said Kim. "Gender is a lens through which you can understand these important issues."</p>

He is truly an important asset to our campus," said Stephen Thorsett, dean of physical and biological sciences, in a statement announcing the award.</p><p>Fink's 40-year career in academia has been studded with landmark contributions to the field of biophysical chemistry. With more than 200 scientific publications, 20 book chapters, and three books, he is a world authority on protein folding. Mistakes in this molecular process lead to degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad-cow disease. Fink's research aims to understand what goes wrong and to design treatments that can repair the damage or prevent it from happening.</p><p>"Dr. Fink is renowned for his contributions to the understanding of the molecular basis of enzyme mechanisms, protein folding, molecular chaperones, and diseases involving protein aggregation and deposition," the award notice stated.</p><p>Fink joined the UCSC faculty in 1969, one year after he finished his Ph.D. in chemistry at Queen's University, Canada. During his long tenure here, Fink has spent several sabbaticals and visiting fellowships at Brandeis University and at Oxford and Cambridge universities in England. Since 1999, he has also participated as a senior scientist in research at the Parkinson's Institute in Sunnyvale. </p><p>Fink is known for cultivating a cohesive research atmosphere in his lab, coordinating group potluck dinners, bike rides, and camping trips. He has advised more than 60 graduate students, 50 postdoctoral fellows, and hundreds of undergraduates. He has also frequently opened his lab to visiting undergraduates in summer research programs and to sabbatical visitors from around the world. </p><p>In 2002, Fink won the BioSTAR outreach ambassador of the year award and in 2004 was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world's largest professional scientific organization. He is also an accomplished fine-art photographer who has exhibited his work in Santa Cruz County's Open Studios. In May, a symposium held on campus in Fink's honor brought together colleagues and former students from across the United States, Japan, Mexico, and South America.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9153c5158072704601a012ff3b214142"><name>1702</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Students invited to become UC LEADS scholars</title><summary>The UC LEADS program identifies students who are traditionally underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields who have strong leadership skills and the potential to earn Ph.D.s.</summary><keywords>UC LEADS program for underrepresented minority students</keywords><description>The UC LEADS program identifies students who are traditionally underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields who have strong leadership skills and the potential to earn Ph.D.s.</description><start-date>1193900400000</start-date><display-name>Students invited to become...</display-name><path>/2007/11/1702</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/11/1702</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338440373</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338440373</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC LEADS (University of California Leadership Excellence through Advanced DegreeS) program identifies students who are traditionally underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields who have strong leadership skills and the potential to earn Ph.D.s.

"In my case, I've always been interested in how organizations work, and what I've learned can be useful in combating sexism and racism."</p><p>Chemers's passion for research was evident during his tenure as dean of the division of Social Sciences, where he was known as a powerful champion of research whose small-grants program helped boost the careers of many professors. </p><p>And so, when Social Sciences Dean Sheldon Kamieniecki established a new award to recognize senior faculty members who have made major impacts through their research, he created the Martin M. Chemers Award for Outstanding Research in the Division of Social Sciences. The annual award honors a faculty member who has earned an outstanding national and international reputation in her or his field. </p><p>"It's a great honor," Chemers said of having the research award established in his name. "When Sheldon approached me, I felt very proud. And a friend said to me later, 'Every time it's given to someone, it's given to you, too,' which is nice."</p><p>The inaugural award was presented on October 11 to psychology professor Bruce Bridgeman, who has made essential contributions to the study of vision and perception. Bridgeman, who received a plaque and a check for $2,500, said it is gratifying to be recognized by his UCSC colleagues.</p><p> </p><p>"It's nice to get an award locally from the people who've known me and known my career for a long time," said Bridgeman, who has built an outstanding career at UCSC since joining the faculty in 1973. "This is my first and only job."</p><p>Bridgeman has been widely recognized for his visual study of spatial orientation. By revealing key ways the brain takes in and processes visual information, his work has explained spatial illusions and shown that vision is an active process.</p><p>"Bruce Bridgeman is a pioneer in the field of visual perception research," said Kamieniecki, whose primary goal as dean is to raise the profile of the Division of Social Sciences by recruiting and retaining the best faculty. "He sets a high standard for future recipients of this award."</p><p>Of Chemers, Kamieniecki said, "As a dean, a professor, and a campus leader, he has had the kind of impact we academics dream of. It's a pleasure to honor a man who is so widely admired and respected for his work."</p><p>----</p><p><i>Friends and faculty have contributed to the Martin M.

Although Fairlie and Marion focused on Proposition 209's effects on minority firms, the <a href="http://www.impact209.org/about-the-symposium/">conference</a> addressed a broad range of topics.</p><p>"Proposition 209 had a wide reach into public employment, college admissions, and government contracting," said Fairlie. "Our studies represent the first examination of the impact of Proposition 209 on minority- and female-owned businesses."</p><p>Prior to the passage of Proposition 209, affirmative-action programs were widely used to award contracts that generated a significant source of revenue for some firms owned by minorities and women, said Fairlie. </p><p>Despite the gains in self-employment among women and minorities in the wake of Proposition 209, Fairlie noted one exception to that trend: The average self-employment rate of African American men is lower than it was prior to the initiative's passage, a finding he attributes to a pre-existing downward trend in self-employment among blacks in California.  </p><p>Marion's analyses focused on the costs and benefits of affirmative action. As he examined the changes in what the government pays for highway construction projects since the passage of Proposition 209, Marion found that prices fell by 5.6 percent. "That suggests that affirmative action in procurement raises the costs of contractors," he said. </p><p>In a second paper, Marion found that affirmative-action programs do increase the utilization of firms owned by minorities and women. "After Proposition 209, we see fewer highway construction establishments located in neighborhoods with a large minority population," he said. "That suggests that firms in these neighborhoods are less successful."</p><p>Studying the impacts of Proposition 209 is important, particularly in a state where voters are continually asked to resolve thorny public-policy issues. "Statewide ballot initiatives have potential large effects that we need to monitor, and faculty across the UC system are engaged with that work," said Fairlie.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9153cc8b8072704601a012ffed15cb24"><name>1707</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Celebrating international education</title><summary>UCSC will join college campuses around the world November 12-16 in celebration of the seventh annual International Education Week  by offering an array of programs and activities for the campus and the Santa Cruz community.</summary><keywords>International Education Week</keywords><description>UCSC will join college campuses around the world November 12-16 in celebration of the seventh annual International Education Week  by offering an array of programs and activities for the campus and the Santa Cruz community.</description><start-date>1193900400000</start-date><display-name>Celebrating international education...</display-name><path>/2007/11/1707</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/11/1707</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338442299</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338442299</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/11/images/logo.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/11/images/logo.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>logo.jpg</name><file-size>43491</file-size><width>250</width><height>198</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UCSC will join college campuses around the world November 12-16 in celebration of the eighth annual International Education Week, a joint initiative of the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Education to recognize the global exchange environment between the United States and other countries.</p>

The group comprises the chief academic officers at the state's 109 community colleges. </p><p>Blumenthal said that increases in the enrollment of transfer students were made in every year except the most recent. He said he thinks part of that is due to enrollment declines at the colleges themselves in the past few years. Community college enrollments are up this year, and Blumenthal said he expects transfers to increase in the years to come. </p><p>The chancellor noted that community colleges admit a far more diverse population of students than either the University of California or the California State University systems. And community colleges serve a larger proportion of immigrants and their children, Blumenthal said. </p><p>UC campuses benefit from the increased diversity of community college transfers, he said.  </p><p>"Our campuses become better and more diverse--I know UC Santa Cruz certainly does--when we admit junior transfers from community colleges."</p><p>Blumenthal recalled that the partnership between the UC and community colleges dates back more than 100 years. The two systems were instrumental in winning legislative approval of state's historic Master Plan for Higher Education nearly 50 years ago, he said. </p><p>Lori Gaskin, vice president of academic affairs and student services at Lake Tahoe Community College and president of the organization, said she and her colleagues were impressed by Blumenthal's knowledge of the programs and initiatives designed to assist community college transfers. </p><p>Renee Kilmer, vice president of instruction at Cabrillo College, thanked the chancellor for his efforts to increase transfers from Cabrillo and other regional colleges.</p><p>John Swensson, interim vice president of instruction at DeAnza College in Cupertino, pointed to UCSC's Karl S. Pister Scholarship program as having a particularly inspiring effect on his students. The scholarship fund founded by the former UCSC chancellor provides a $20,000 annual scholarship to a student from each of the 13 regional community colleges in San Mateo, Santa Clara, Monterey, and Santa Cruz counties.</p><p>This fall, 825 students transferred to UC Santa Cruz. About 87 percent--720--came from the 13 regional colleges. The largest number--119--transferred from Cabrillo College. </p><p>Blumenthal said he is committed to ensuring that transfer students succeed when they enroll at UC Santa Cruz.  </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9153d0258072704601a012ff15ecd213"><name>1709</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>United Way, UCSC partner to lend a helping hand</title><summary>The campus United Way Campaign, which has the theme "Our Community United--Local Dollars, Local Solutions," hopes to raise $75,000.</summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-5312; gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>United Way, Our Community United--Local Dollars, Local Solutions</keywords><description>The campus United Way Campaign, which has the theme "Our Community United--Local Dollars, Local Solutions," hopes to raise $75,000.</description><start-date>1193900400000</start-date><display-name>United Way, UCSC partner...</display-name><path>/2007/11/1709</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/11/1709</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338443250</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338443250</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/11/images/united_way.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/11/images/united_way.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>united_way.300.jpg</name><file-size>16820</file-size><width>300</width><height>197</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Liz Evanovich wants $75,000.</p>
<p>That's the goal the community relations coordinator in the Office of Government &amp; Community Relations has set for this year's campus United Way Campaign, which runs November 1-16. Informational materials on the campaign, with the theme "Our Community United--Local Dollars, Local Solutions," have already arrived in mailboxes for the campus's 4,100 employees.</p>
<p>United Way of Santa Cruz County gives out about $1.3 million a year to local health and human service agency programs that help children, the elderly, the disabled, and families in crisis, said Martin Chemers, professor of psychology and president of the United Way board of trustees.</p>
<p>"This is essentially the infrastructure for the community when times get bad," said Chemers, who was acting chancellor in 2004-2005 and also recently had a <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1703">research award established in his name</a>. "Over the years, the government has played less of a role when people need it. More and more, nonprofits are the ones who do it."</p>
<p>In last year's campaign, UCSC raised $64,924, with a campus participation rate of 9.3 percent, according to Evanovich. Participation rates have been declining over the past several years, however, she said. In 2004, the rate was 14.5 percent. Evanovich's $75,000 goal would equal a participation rate of 15 percent, she estimated.</p>
<p>This year, United Way and Second Harvest Food Bank of Santa Cruz and San Benito Counties are working together on the "Above &amp; Beyond" campaign. UCSC employees who donate more to United Way than they did last year will have the overage donated to Second Harvest for expansion and improvements to the food bank's facility. Second Harvest sponsors will match those contributions dollar for dollar.</p>
<p>Also, if employees choose to donate through payroll deduction this year, their name will be entered into a raffle for two roundtrip tickets from JetBlue Airways.</p>

<p>Re: Information about moth spraying</p>
<p>As you may already know, the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) is planning pheromone applications for the Santa Cruz area as part of a program to eradicate the light brown apple moth, a pest that damages crops and other plants. Insects use pheromones to attract mating partners, and the spraying is intended to prevent the moths from reproducing. Applications are scheduled in Santa Cruz County from November 4 to 9.</p>
<p>Information about the Light Brown Apple Moth Eradication Program is available on the CDFA web site at: <a href="http://www.cdfa.ca.gov/phpps/PDEP/lbam/lbam_main.html">http://www.cdfa.ca.gov/phpps/PDEP/lbam/lbam_main.html</a></p>
<p>Please feel free to share this information with any family members who may have concerns about the spraying.</p>
<p>In addition to the eradication program web site, above, the CDFA has provided the following as a "contact" e-mail address for people seeking more information: <a href="mailto:lbam@cdfa.ca.gov">lbam@cdfa.ca.gov</a></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9153d3788072704601a012ff5541c944"><name>1711</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</summary><keywords>UCSC in the News</keywords><description>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</description><start-date>1193986800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2007/11/1711</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/11/1711</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338444105</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338444105</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><i>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</i></p><p>Division of Social Sciences dean <b>Sheldon Kamieniecki</b> had the final word in a lengthy article in the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i> about Al Gore's Nobel Peace Prize for his work on climate change.

Located 41 light-years away in the constellation Cancer, this star now holds the record for the number of confirmed extrasolar planets orbiting within its planetary system.</p>
<p>The discovery marks an exciting new era, in which astronomers begin to explore how solar systems are formed and whether ours follows a pattern that's common throughout the universe, according to Steven S. Vogt, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a member of the planet search team.</p>
<p>"Now we're able to find complex systems of planets," Vogt said. "We're able to take long strings of data and eke out signals of five or more planets around a given star; so we're starting to see systems that look more like our own solar system."</p>
<p>Astronomers have found nearly 250 exoplanets, but only one other star, mu Ara in the southern sky, is known to have four planets. The unique 55 Cancri system is notable because its clutch of four inner planets and one giant outer planet resembles our own solar system, although without an Earth or Mars. The star also has nearly the same mass and age as our sun. As more data accumulates, more planets around 55 Cancri are likely to be discovered, Vogt said.</p>

<p>"There could be an Earth-like planet," said Vogt. "We can't see it yet, but we'll keep looking at this system."</p>
<p>The mass of the newly discovered planet is about 45 times that of Earth and its composition and appearance may be similar to Saturn's. Its position is fourth out from its star, 55 Cancri, and it completes one orbit every 260 days. The new planet is located in the "habitable zone," a band around the star where the temperature would permit liquid water to pool on solid surfaces. The planet's distance from its star is approximately 116.7 million kilometers (72.5 million miles), slightly closer than Earth to the sun, but it orbits a star that is slightly fainter than our sun.</p>
<p>The discovery comes after 19 years of observing 55 Cancri and represents a milestone for the California and Carnegie Planet Search team, which this year celebrates the 20th anniversary of its first attempts to find extrasolar planets by analyzing the wobbles they cause in their host star.</p>

<p>The team included Geoffrey Marcy, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, and Paul Butler, now at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, who both began observations of 55 Cancri and other nearby stars at UC's Lick Observatory in 1987. Debra Fischer, an astronomer at San Francisco State University, is lead author on the paper, which will appear in a future issue of <em>Astrophysical Journal.</em></p>
<p>"This is the first quintuple-planet system," said Fischer. "This system has a dominant gas giant planet in an orbit similar to our Jupiter. Like the planets orbiting our sun, most of these planets reside in nearly circular orbits."</p>
<p>The team's long history of highly precise measurements--more than 300 for 55 Cancri alone--made it possible to detect the presence of a fifth planet. Data from both the Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton east of San Jose and the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii contributed to the discovery.</p>

<p>"We can hold very high measurement precision over decades," said Vogt, who built the instruments used by the team--the Hamilton spectrometer on the 3-meter Shane Telescope at Lick Observatory.</p>
<p>Finding multiple planets around a star is difficult because each planet produces its own stellar wobble. Marcy compared detecting the wobble within wobbles caused by one of several planets to picking out a single musical note from many played simultaneously. The Doppler technique used by the search team sees this wobble as a change in the speed with which a star moves toward or away from us. The search team can detect velocities as small as 1 meter per second, which is walking speed.</p>
<p>The planet population around 55 Cancri is somewhat different than the one orbiting our sun. The innermost planet is believed to be about the size of Neptune and whips around the star in just less than three days at a distance of approximately 5.6 million kilometers (3.5 million miles). The second planet out from the star is a little smaller than Jupiter and completes one orbit every 14.7 days at a distance of approximately 17.9 million kilometers (11.2 million miles). The third planet out from the star, the Saturn-mass one, completes one orbit every 44 days at a distance of approximately 35.9 million kilometers (22.3 million miles). The fourth planet out is the newly discovered one. The fifth and most distant known planet is four-times the mass of Jupiter and completes one orbit every 14 years at a distance of approximately 867.7 million kilometers (539.1 million miles). It is still the only known Jupiter-like gas giant to reside as far away from its star as our own Jupiter.</p>
<p>UCSC's Gregory Laughlin, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, was also a coauthor. Using computer models, Laughlin tested the theoretical stability of the proposed system of planets orbiting 55 Cancri.</p>
<p>Coauthors at other institutions include Jason Wright, John Johnson, and Kathryn Peek of UC Berkeley; Gregory Henry of Tennessee State University's Center of Excellence in Information Systems; and David Abouav, Chris McCarthy and Howard Isaacson of San Francisco State University.</p>
<p>Funding for this study was provided by NASA and the National Science Foundation. The search for exoplanets will continue with future NASA missions. NASA's Kepler, scheduled for launch in 2009, is expected to find planets as small as Earth.</p>

He was 66. </p><p>Flatté, a professor emeritus of physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, had been ill for many years, but had maintained an active research program and continued to work on campus after his retirement in 2004. His numerous interdisciplinary collaborations grew out of his interest in numerical simulation of waves propagating through random media. He also made significant contributions to basic research in particle physics.</p><p>"He was almost unique on campus, not only in the number of areas in which he was involved, but also the level of recognition for his contributions in different areas," said Abraham Seiden, director of the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) at UCSC. "He worked with a large number of different people on campus, and in recent years he did more in ocean sciences and Earth sciences than in physics itself."</p><p>Flatté earned a B.S. in physics at the California Institute of Technology and a Ph.D. in physics at UC Berkeley. He worked as a research physicist at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory for five years before joining the UCSC faculty in 1971. At UCSC, he was affiliated with both SCIPP and the Institute of Marine Sciences. Flatté also served as a member of JASON, a national scientific advisory group to many government agencies.</p><p>As an indication of the diversity of his interests and contributions, Flatté was a fellow of the American Physical Society, the Acoustical Society of America, the Optical Society of America, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In the area of particle physics, the Flatté Parametrization he developed is still used to describe the decay of certain kinds of mesons (fundamental particles made of quarks and antiquarks). </p><p>Flatté's work on ocean acoustics began in the mid-1970s and continued for more than two decades. He helped develop a new paradigm in understanding sound transmission in the ocean. In the 1990s, he was involved in the Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) experiment, which aimed to track the average temperature of the ocean using sound waves.</p><p>In the area of atmospheric optics, Flatté studied the propagation of light waves through atmospheric turbulence. This work led to a collaboration with Claire Max, a pioneer in the field of adaptive optics for telescopes and now director of the Center for Adaptive Optics at UCSC and a professor of astronomy and astrophysics.</p><p>In seismology, Flatté contributed to research on the scattering of seismic waves in the deep Earth. Geophysicist Ru-Shan Wu came to UCSC in 1986 to work with Flatté on scattering theory. Thorne Lay, professor of Earth and planetary sciences, said this collaboration led to the development by Wu of important techniques used by the oil exploration industry.</p><p>"His collaboration with Ru-Shan Wu led to a major research program here at UCSC," Lay said. "It exemplifies the cross-disciplinary opportunities that characterize UC Santa Cruz. Flatté helped establish strong interdisciplinary connections that have been a major advantage of our campus."</p><p>Flatté is survived by his wife of 41 years, Renelde, of Santa Cruz; their son Michael of Iowa City and daughter Anne of San Francisco; his mother Henrietta Flatté of Los Angeles; and six grandchildren. </p><p>A memorial service will be held on Sunday, November 11, at 2 p.m. at Temple Beth El, 3055 Porter Gulch Road, in Aptos.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9153dc1e8072704601a012ff5438150c"><name>1717</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Eminent physicist Stanley Flatté dies</title><keywords>Flatte, Stanley Flatte</keywords><start-date>1194332400000</start-date><display-name>Eminent physicist Stanley Flatté...</display-name><path>/2007/11/1717</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/11/1717</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338446304</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338446304</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am sorry to inform you that longtime UCSC physicist Stanley Flatté died earlier this week after a lengthy illness.

"Consumers believe these products will protect them, which creates a kind of political anesthesia and precludes the collective action that generates real change."</p><p>In his book, Szasz documents the widespread popularity of products designed to protect consumers from environmental threats, critiques their effectiveness, and describes the unintended political consequences of a populace eager to "shop their way out of harm's way." </p><p>Sales of bottled water have soared amidst public concern over the safety of tap water, and consumers readily pay roughly 1,000 times as much for bottled water as they would pay for the same amount of tap water, says Szasz. But what are they getting for their money? Bottled water is less stringently regulated than tap water, according to Szasz. And although people who consistently eat organic foods do have lower levels of pesticide residues in their bodies, they are not residue-free. As for "natural" personal hygiene products, "nontoxic" household cleaning products, "natural" clothing, bedding, and furniture, Szasz points out that these products are poorly regulated, if they are regulated at all.</p><p>"These products do not work nearly well enough to warrant the faith consumers have placed in them," said Szasz, who calls this individualistic, consumer-based approach to protection "inverted quarantine." He likens the phenomenon to the fallout shelter panic of 1961, when Americans briefly embraced the notion that they could survive a nuclear attack in a backyard shelter. For a few months, until people accepted the fact that such shelters would fail--and tensions with Russia eased--the nation was in the throes of a frenzy that illuminates "the ultimate limits of individual self-protection," according to Szasz. The shelter panic is an extreme example of inverted quarantine, but the dynamics today are similar, he said.</p><p>"Rather than trying to limit the presence of contaminants in our environment, people are trying to keep contaminants out of their bodies," said Szasz. "It's a very fatalistic approach, and it is only an option for those who can afford to buy bottled water, organic food, and all the other putative shields available in today's marketplace." </p><p>Because consumers place such high levels of faith in these products, they feel far less compelled to support, or participate in, efforts to actually clean up the environment, said Szasz, author of <i>Ecopopulism: Toxic Waste and the Movement for Environmental Justice</i> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1994). </p><p>"People feel vulnerable, and rightly so, but instead of engaging in political action, they respond by trying to barricade themselves from environmental hazards," he said. "By shopping, they think they've solved the problem. It's a form of political anesthesia, and it's really the opposite of what environmentalism is all about."</p><p>Although surveys show that Americans overwhelmingly want clean air and clean water, environmental policy hasn't risen to the top tier of issues on voters' minds for years, a disconnect that Szasz attributes to their belief that they have successfully purchased protection for themselves and their families. </p><p>"Consumers don't get the protection they think they're buying, which is a problem for the individual," said Szasz. "The problem for society is that their false belief produces political anesthesia." </p><p>But environmental threats are real, and they are likely only to intensify, warned Szasz, who hopes public awareness of the inverted quarantine effect will rouse people from their complacency and rekindle a more vibrant, collective environmental movement. "But that will happen only if Americans reject the mirage of individual solutions to our collective plight," he concluded.</p><p>------------</p><p><b>Note to reporters</b>: Szasz may be reached at (831) 459-2653 or via e-mail at szasz@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9153e00a8072704601a012ff0045348d"><name>1720</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pettigrew honored for lifetime achievement</title><summary>Thomas Pettigrew, research professor of social psychology, has been selected by the International Academy of Intercultural Research (IAIR) to receive the Lifetime Achievement Award at the group's sixth biennial conference in Honolulu in August 2009.</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-4399; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>pettigrew, award, psychology, lifetime</keywords><description>Thomas Pettigrew, research professor of social psychology, has been selected by the International Academy of Intercultural Research (IAIR) to receive the Lifetime Achievement Award at the group's sixth biennial conference in Honolulu in August 2009.</description><start-date>1194418800000</start-date><display-name>Pettigrew honored for lifetime...</display-name><path>/2007/11/1720</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/11/1720</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338447283</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338447283</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/11/images/pettigrew.06_08_14.180.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/11/images/pettigrew.06_08_14.180.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pettigrew.06_08_14.180.jpg</name><file-size>24042</file-size><width>180</width><height>206</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Thomas Pettigrew.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Thomas Pettigrew, research professor of social psychology, has been selected by the International Academy of Intercultural Research (IAIR) to receive the Lifetime Achievement Award at the group's sixth biennial conference in Honolulu in August 2009.  </p><p>The honor is the latest for Pettigrew, an internationally recognized expert on racism and intergroup relations.</p><p>"Tom has been a major figure in the furthering of a more equitable society by his research, writing, and persuasiveness," said Dan Landis, professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Mississippi and executive director of the IAIR.

Abilities range from complete novice to gymnasts who have competed at the national level. Practices are four times a week, with club members coaching each other.

"I think of the library as the crown jewel of this campus--the cherry trees outside in bloom, the ferns and greenery of the courtyard, the building and windows projecting a majestic serenity--it's such an open, inviting, and resourceful place; I still feel it's like my own personal library as I continue to work on my research."</p><p>Yung was joined on the dais by John Dizikes, professor emeritus of American studies and founding faculty member of Cowell College; Stan Stevens, UCSC's map librarian from 1965 to 1993; and Virginia Jansen, professor emerita of art history--who at the end of her talk said, "I'd like to close my remarks with the dreamy wish: if only everything at UCSC worked as well as the library..."</p><p>Dizikes opened his portion of the program by reciting Will Rogers' famous adage, "I never met a man I didn't like," adding, "Well, I'm more discriminating than he was.but I have to say, I never met a librarian I didn't like." </p><p>"The heart of this institution has been the people," Dizikes noted. "The library is the center of the university; this is the focal place where we collaborate and work together."</p><p>After a question-and-answer period with the panel, University Librarian Ginny Steel gave an update on the progress of the library renovation, which will transform the building into a state-of-the-art technological research facility. She said that in early December, the addition will be completed, and the campus will then begin testing to make sure the electrical, heating, safety, and various other systems are in working order. </p><p>Steel explained that the contents of the entire library will then be moved into the new addition for an 18-month period, while the existing building is completely gutted down to the exterior walls and windows. </p><p>"Everything will change and the building will be brought up to code," said Steel. "The entry will still be on the second floor, but instead of the glass doors, a gate will be rolled down whenever the library is open. There will be a café  <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press_releases/text.asp?pid=1028">see Currents story</a>  in the foyer, along with a reading room, plus the reference, circulation and information technology desks." </p><p>Steel added that Special Collections will occupy the entire third floor in the renovated library and the fourth floor will host administrative offices plus group study spaces around the perimeter. Media Services will also move into the library, occupying the first floor along with the library's technical services and the Visual Resources Center. </p><p>Steel also noted that the last library exhibit before the spring move into the new addition, <i>One Last Look: A Photographic History of McHenry Library</i>, is now on display on the second floor. Co-curators--reference specialist Laura McClanathan and reference librarian Ken Lyons--drew from more than 40 years of historical photographs housed in Special Collections to create a tribute to McHenry Library's past. Accompanying the historic photos is a multimedia exhibit comprised of a slide show of materials from the library's Visual Resource Collection, plus a brief video of 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake damage. </p><p>For more information about the McHenry Library Addition and Renovation Project, go to the Library web site: <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/mcadd/">McHenry Library</a>.</p><p></p><p>					</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9153ec4b8072704601a012ffebbd0b7a"><name>1730</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Women's Forum on Staff Career Advancement</title><start-date>1194505200000</start-date><display-name>UC Women's Forum on...</display-name><path>/2007/11/1730</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/11/1730</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338450457</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338450457</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Join us and share your thoughts on the advancement of women staff at UC.

(Photo by Phil Carter)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Two related protests on campus yesterday resulted in the arrest of six individuals, the issuance of citations, the impounding of vehicles, and a clash between protestors and law enforcement personnel.  The incidents, which occurred on two parking lots proposed for the Biomedical Sciences Facility, involved a number of individuals not affiliated with the campus, including five people who scaled trees early in the morning on the site.</p><p>Instead of the constructive expression of speech through a nonviolent demonstration, the protest morphed into a dangerous example of inappropriate and in some cases illegal behavior.</p><p>Our police officers were stationed on the Biomedical Sciences Facility site yesterday because we asked them to secure a heavily traveled pedestrian area made very dangerous by a pre-dawn incident there. During that first protest, people climbed trees, hoisted wooden platforms high above the ground, and, in the process, dislodged a number of heavy branches.</p><p>By early afternoon, a second protest on the site was marred by a hostile confrontation with our officers--and with the Santa Cruz City and County law enforcement personnel whom we were unfortunately required to summon. This aggression included pushing through the barriers that had been erected to secure the area.</p><p>We respect the right of all individuals to speak freely on our campus. The expression of ideas, combined with passion, can be a powerful force for change.</p><p>But our responsibility is to also ensure that the campus's academic and support activities are conducted without disruption and in a safe manner. Individuals--whether affiliated with the campus or visiting--who commit unlawful acts or violate university regulations will be subject to the legal and financial consequences of their behavior. </p><p>I would also like to make four observations to clarify or correct information some protestors expressed at yesterday's demonstration:</p><p>. Our 2005 Long-Range Development Plan (LRDP) does not mandate that the campus grow by 4,500 students in the 15 years leading up to 2020. It does provide a general blueprint for that level of growth should campus expansion be needed to serve future California students and fulfill the state's educational mission.</p><p>. The process for producing an updated LRDP began years ago, before many of today's students enrolled at UCSC. To suggest that students were not involved in the plan's creation is inaccurate. Students served on campus LRDP committees and produced a "student involvement" paper that presented their perspectives.</p><p>. Even the more vocal critics of our LRDP believe that the Biomedical Sciences Facility will greatly serve our biology and health sciences students, generate meaningful research in areas such as public health, and provide economic opportunities in the Santa Cruz area in the form of biotechnology research.</p><p>. UCSC has worked diligently in its 42-year history to build a campus that respects its spectacular environment. That's one reason why UCSC is universally recognized and consistently ranked as one of the most beautiful campuses in the world. It's also a reason why our faculty and staff designated two existing parking lots as the site for the new Biomedical Sciences Facility.</p><p>Reasonable people can hold very different opinions about plans or building projects that express UCSC growth. People feel passionately about this subject and this campus, and that is a good thing.</p><p>But that passion is best expressed in a manner that values discourse, disagreement, and debate.  As our <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles_community.asp">Principles of Community</a> make very clear, violent expression of one's beliefs is no substitute for these values at UCSC.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal and Campus Provost/EVC David Kliger</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9153ef268072704601a012ff1d52e9e2"><name>1732</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus gets a little bit 'greener' with three more certifications</title><summary>UCSC has received three new "green" certifications from the Monterey Bay Area Green Business Program, administered by the City of Santa Cruz.

At the November 13 City Council meeting, the city will recognize certifications for three new campus locations: Porter/Kresge Dining Hall, Cowell/Stevenson Dining Hall, and University Catering.</p><p>Crown/Merrill Dining Hall and Banana Joe's Café are already certified. In the works for future certification are Owl's Nest Café, Terra Fresca, and College 9/10 Dining Hall. </p><p>"It really makes sense," said Jeffries. "We want to do our part and make as little an impact on the environment as we can. We serve a lot of people, so by doing our part we're having a pretty big effect." </p><p>UC Santa Cruz Dining serves about 15,000 meals per day, Jeffries estimated. The green-certified facilities, not including University Catering, serve about 6,500 of those meals per day, he said. University Catering serves about 500 people per week. </p><p>The Monterey Bay Area Green Business Program is a partnership of environmental agencies, utilities, and nonprofit organizations that assist, recognize, and promote businesses and government agencies that volunteer to operate in a more environmentally responsible way. </p><p>The program is an offshoot of the Bay Area Green Business Program, which was developed by Bay Area local governments in collaboration with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the state Environmental Protection Agency's Department of Toxic Substances Control, and the business community. The Association of Bay Area Governments coordinates the program, which is implemented by green business coordinators in nine participating counties. The regional and local programs are funded by their partners, including local and regional government agencies, utilities, special districts, and nonprofit organizations that promote environmental compliance, pollution prevention, and resource conservation. Some funding also comes from government and nonprofit foundation grants.</p><p>To be certified "green," participants must be in compliance with all regulations and meet program standards for conserving resources, preventing pollution, and minimizing waste.</p><p>There are more than 150 criteria a facility must satisfy in each of the overarching areas, said Jeffries. Inspectors come from the City of Santa Cruz and nonprofit environmental consultancy Ecology Action to make sure a location is following the criteria. Each certification lasts three years. </p><p>Jeffries would even like to go past the green certification requirements by making changes such as installing energy-efficient lighting and expanding composting to all dining locations. Right now, some kitchens do composting, but Jeffries hasn't yet found an organization to take compost from every unit. </p><p>Getting three more sites certified is a "major accomplishment," said Jeffries. </p><p>But, he said, "It's way more than me and the managers at the locations getting certified."</p><p>From staff and students to energy managers at Physical Plant and maintenance workers, Jeffries said, "everyone is contributing to make sure we follow these practices." </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9153f0968072704601a012ff87429fae"><name>1733</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</summary><keywords>UCSC in the news</keywords><description>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</description><start-date>1194591600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News...</display-name><path>/2007/11/1733</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/11/1733</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338451552</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338451552</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><i>UCSC in the News is a weekly column summarizing prominent media placements UCSC faculty, staff, and students have received.</i></p><p>An article in the <i>Sacramento Bee</i> about the melting Arctic sea ice featured climate scientist <b>Lisa Sloan</b> and former graduate student <b>Jacob Sewall.</b> </p><p>A new book coauthored by <b>Jonathan Fox</b> of Latin American and Latino studies made headlines in Mexico City, where three major dailies, <i>Reform, La Jornada,</i> and <i>Universal,</i> covered news of the publication. </p><p>Ocean scientist <b>Raphael Kudela</b> was a guest on a local call-in program on San Francisco public radio station KALW to discuss the health of the oceans. </p><p>The <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i> ran a front page story about research at Lick Observatory, with quotes from astronomers <b>Steven Vogt, Michael Bolte, Remington Stone,</b> and Chancellor <b>George Blumenthal.</b> Vogt was also quoted in a subsequent <i>Sentinel</i> story about his team's discovery of a record fifth planet orbiting a distant star.</p><p><i>Metro Santa Cruz</i> published a cover story featuring history professor <b>Dana Frank</b> and her new book <i>Local Girl Makes History.</i> </p><p>Glaciologist <b>Slawek Tulaczyk</b> was quoted in an article about the glaciers on Mt.

As your new vice chancellor of Student Affairs, I write to remind you of your rights and responsibilities as members of our UC Santa Cruz community. Over the course of the Fall Quarter, there have been several incidents that have been harmful to our campus environment and given cause for concern. The actions of a few individuals have, at times, negatively impacted our campus climate and jeopardized the safety of others. Most recently, there has been a rash of vandalism, unruly and aggressive protest activity, graffiti, and insensitive acts that have caused others to feel unwelcome and disrespected. (Please see <a href="http://messages.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=1731">campus message</a> from Chancellor George Blumenthal and Campus Provost/EVC David Kliger about this week's demonstration.)</p><p>UCSC is a community that values the free and open exchange of ideas in the pursuit of knowledge. We are committed to maintaining a culture of civility, objectivity, inquiry and learning -- one that is free of coercion, intimidation, and dehumanization. As members of this community we all share an obligation to uphold the Principles of Community and abide by the student Code of Conduct. I ask that you familiarize yourself with the resources listed below, as they will help you to better understand the policies and standards of behavior to which students are accountable. These community standards exist to ensure a safe and welcoming campus environment for all students, and we will respond with appropriate consequences for those who violate university policy and/or the law. Most importantly, we must demonstrate respect for difference, openness to new ideas and perspectives, and a willingness to work and learn together in an inclusive and safe environment.</p><p>Please know that the Division of Student Affairs stands ready to assist you throughout your academic journey, and we welcome any questions or concerns you may have regarding rules, policies, or the Principles of Community. For more information, please contact the Student Judicial Affairs office at 459-1738 or the Dean of Students at 459-4446.

To sign up, go to <a href="http://www.ucscrecreation.com">www.ucscrecreation.com</a>.</p><p><b>Shodo Japanese Calligraphy</b></p><p>Thursday, November 15, 6:15 to 9:15 p.m.</p><p>Baytree Conference Center Room D</p><p>Cost is $15</p><p>Learn the basic fundamentals of Shodo, Japanese calligraphy, using traditional ink and brush. Shodo is a traditional art that is practiced by common people as well as Zen and Shinto priests, martial artists, and other types of artists. There's a saying in Japan, "A person's writing shows their character." Shodo teaches you how to meditate and express your inner strength in your art and life. In this workshop, you will start with the meditation of making ink, then continue on to learn basic strokes using a calligraphy brush.</p><p>Materials: Please bring old newspapers to practice on and the following supplies: large suzuri (ink-making stone), sumi (bar of dried ink), and fude (calligraphy brush).</p><p>Instructor Yoshihito Shibata has been practicing Shodo since he was 5 years old. He has studied at a Zen temple, while studying other traditional arts, and went to a school for calligraphy for 15 years. By the age of 14, he had already reached the level of "rokudan" (sixth degree) and had won prizes in several national competitions. He has taught classes locally over the years, but he does Shodo mostly to enhance his martial arts training.</p><p></p><p><b>Tango Workshop</b></p><p>Thursday, November 15, 7:30 to 9:30 p.m.</p><p>Multipurpose Room, East Field House</p><p>Cost is $10</p><p>Come out and learn how to Tango in this evening workshop. Both singles and couples are welcome. To make sure everyone has a chance to learn how to lead and follow flexibly, there will be frequent rotations of partners in which everyone is urged to participate. At the end of class there will be a practice time when those who came with a partner can work together. Class members are encouraged to learn the nontraditional role (women as leaders, men as followers) if they wish.  Wear comfortable clothing that allows you to move. Footwear should be lightweight and well-connected to your foot.</p><p>Instructor Mario Avila teaches at the Palomar Ballroom and has an undying love for Swing music and dancing, yet specializes in Latin Rhythm dances such as Salsa, Rumba, Cha Cha. and Bolero.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9153f8718072704601a012ff8400b438"><name>1738</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Blumenthal says highest priority is increasing faculty salaries</title><summary>Chancellor George Blumenthal told the UCSC Academic Senate that a four-year plan is on track to bring faculty salaries to the levels of comparable institutions.</summary><author>Guy Lasnier, (831) 459-2955, lasnier@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Blumenthal, Kliger, faculty salaries, protest, academic senate, Quentin Williams,</keywords><description>Chancellor George Blumenthal told the UCSC Academic Senate that a four-year plan is on track to bring faculty salaries to the levels of comparable institutions.</description><start-date>1194591600000</start-date><display-name>Blumenthal says highest priority...</display-name><path>/2007/11/1738</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/11/1738</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338453568</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338453568</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2955</phone><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Chancellor George Blumenthal told the UCSC Academic Senate that a four-year plan is on track to bring faculty salaries to the levels of comparable institutions. </p><p>He said that despite potential state budget problems there is a commitment on the part of the University of California and himself to increasing faculty salaries. "It is my highest priority to bring faculty salaries up to par," Blumenthal said.</p><p>Salaries and the budget were among many issues that Blumenthal and David Kliger, the campus provost and executive vice chancellor, addressed at the fall meeting of the Academic Senate. </p><p>Blumenthal said the state budget picture "is not good right now. We'll be very fortunate to get our compact funding." In the current budget year, the state funded UC according to the terms of the "compact" reached three years ago with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. But since then the governor has told state agencies to submit budgets for the 2008-09 budget year with 10 percent cuts. Tax revenues are falling behind projections and state budget analysts are anticipating a  $10 billion shortfall. </p><p>Kliger told the senate that grading and infrastructure work on Ranch View Terrace, the faculty housing project near the base of campus, is 90 percent complete. The project is on target to complete the 45 units of phase one by next fall, he said. He also addressed problems with on-campus childcare, saying the "first priority is to stabilize the situation."</p><p> </p><p>Blumenthal and Kliger both addressed the current protest at the proposed site of the Biomedical Sciences Facility, as did Senate Chair Quentin Williams and three faculty members. </p><p>Blumenthal pledged that the building "will move forward and be built." He also said the university has a responsibility to ensure the health and safety of students, faculty, staff and visitors and an obligation to maintain university operations. </p><p>Those operations have been compromised, said Joseph  Konopelski, professor of chemistry and biochemistry. He said the pulling of fire alarms within the Physical Sciences Building and subsequent lock downs of the building have prevented students from meeting with him. </p><p>Kliger said he was particularly disturbed that fliers distributed by protestors target individual faculty members and their research. He called it an attack on academic freedom. </p><p>Anthropology Professor Carolyn Martin Shaw said she was not reassured by Blumenthal and Kliger's comments about the protest. "The word safety is often followed by violence," she said. </p><p>Zack Schlesinger, professor of physics who observed the November 7 protest, said the campus has a long history of civil disobedience and he hoped the response would be "thoughtful and respectful to avoid escalating violence."</p><p>Blumenthal responded that "as long as things remain non-violent they fall within civil disobedience."</p><p>In his opening remarks, Williams, the senate chair, said the university must "ensure that the rights of free speech and assembly are conducted in a safe and constructive manner."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9153fa048072704601a012ff95372616"><name>1739</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pogonip training burn, November 13</title><start-date>1194937200000</start-date><display-name>Pogonip training burn, November...</display-name><path>/2007/11/1739</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/11/1739</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338453973</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338453973</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The City will be conducting their training burn in Pogonip starting at 11:00 today.

Today an estimated 8 percent of the human genetic code consists of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs)--the DNA remnants from these so-called "selfish parasites."</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the infected hosts and their primate descendants also appear to have benefited from this genetic invasion, new evidence suggests. The ancient retroviruses--distant relatives of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)--helped a gene called p53 become an important "master gene regulator" in primates, according to a study published this week in the online early edition of <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</em></p>
<p>The study, led by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, offers an explanation for how regulatory networks of genes evolved. Not all genes are created equal; some are masters that can selectively turn on and off many other genes. The advent of gene regulatory networks allowed for greater control over gene expression in higher vertebrates. With tightly controlled variations in gene expression, species that had very similar genetic codes--for instance, humans and chimpanzees--could nevertheless exhibit striking differences.</p>
<p>Scientists have long wondered how a master regulator such as p53 gained the ability to turn on and off a broad range of other genes related to cell division, DNA repair, and programmed cell death. How did p53 build its complex and powerful empire, so to speak?</p>

<p>Using the tools of computational genomics, the UCSC team gathered compelling evidence that retroviruses helped out. ERVs jumped into new positions throughout the human genome and spread numerous copies of repetitive DNA sequences that allowed p53 to regulate many other genes, the team contends.</p>
<p>"This would have provided a mechanism to quickly establish a gene regulatory network in a very short evolutionary time frame," said Ting Wang, a post-doctoral researcher at UCSC and lead author of the paper.</p>
<p>Thus, p53 was crowned "guardian of the genome," as biologists now call it. Its job is to coordinate the surveillance system that monitors the well-being of cells. Indeed, p53 is so important that when it fails, cancer often results. About half of all human tumors contain a mutated or defective p53 gene.</p>
<p>"Our work provides a new window on the complex biology of p53," said coauthor David Haussler, a professor of biomolecular engineering at UCSC and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator. "From a biomedical standpoint, it's important because these changes only occurred in the primate lineage, not in mice."</p>
<p>By analyzing and comparing genetic data from different species, the team estimated that certain ERVs entered the genome about 40 million years ago, and spread rapidly in primates about 25 million years ago.</p>
<p>Scientists have long suspected that retroviral elements could play a role in gene regulation. More than 50 years ago, Nobel Laureate Barbara McClintock observed that transposable elements--or "jumping genes"--altered gene expression in maize. In 1971, Roy Britten and Eric Davidson theorized that commonly observed repetitive DNA sequences actually served as codes for gene regulatory networks. The DNA remnants of retroviruses tend to be repetitive sequences and can jump around, when active.</p>
<p>The UCSC team finally gathered concrete evidence to support Britten and Davidson's hypothesis. The group trolled the human genome for ERVs, identified p53 binding sites in them, and tested their ability to activate genes regulated by p53. More than one-third of all known p53-binding sites turned out to be associated with ERVs, they discovered.</p>
<p>These results raise new questions about the role of so-called "junk DNA," the vast regions of the genome that don't code for proteins. ERVs fall into that category. Many scientists once believed that such DNA served no purpose, but new data from the Haussler lab and other labs are challenging that view.</p>
<p>"We're starting to uncover the treasure in this junk," said Wang.</p>
<p>Moreover, the team has proposed a new mechanism for evolutionary change. Conventional wisdom says that evolution is driven by small changes--point mutations--to the genetic code. If a change is beneficial, the mutation is passed onto future generations.</p>
<p>Now it appears that another level of evolution occurs that is not driven by point mutations. Instead, retroviruses insert DNA sequences and rearrange the genome, which leads to changes in gene regulation and expression. If such a change in gene regulation is beneficial, it is passed onto future generations.</p>
<p>This research should have broad implications, according to Wang.</p>
<p>"Our prediction is that this is a general mechanism that has been around ever since viruses," Wang said. "ERV-mediated expansion of a gene regulatory network probably happened more than once and not just in primates. We predict it led to other master gene regulators, not just p53."</p>

But Stan Woosley, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, had an idea that he thought could account for it--an extremely massive star that undergoes repeated explosions. When Woosley and two colleages worked out the detailed calculations for their model, the results matched the observations of the supernova known as SN 2006gy, the brightest ever recorded.</p>
<p>The researchers describe the model in a paper to be published in the November 15 issue of the journal <em>Nature.</em> Woosley's coauthors are Sergei Blinnikov, a visiting researcher at UCSC from the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics in Moscow, and Alexander Heger of Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>
<p>"This was a stupendously bright supernova, and we think we have the leading model to explain it. It's a new mechanism for making a supernova, and for doing it again and again in the same star," Woosley said. "We usually think of a supernova as the death of a star, but in this case the same star can blow up half a dozen times."</p>
<p>The first explosion throws off the star's outer shell and produces a not-very-bright supernova-like display. The second explosion puts another supernova's worth of energy into a second shell, which expands at high velocity until it collides with the first shell, producing an extraordinarily brilliant display.</p>
<p>"The two shells collide out at a distance such that the full kinetic energy is converted into light, so it is up to 100 times more luminous than an ordinary supernova," Woosley said. "Usually a supernova only converts 1 percent of its kinetic energy into light, because it has to expand so much before the light can escape."</p>
<p>This mechanism requires an extremely massive star, 90 to 130 times the mass of the Sun, he said. As a star this big nears the end of its life, the temperature in the core gets so hot that some of the energy from gamma-ray radiation converts into pairs of electrons and their anti-matter counterparts, positrons. The result is a phenomenon called "pair instability," in which conversion of radiation into electron-positron pairs causes the radiation pressure to drop, and the star begins to contract rapidly.</p>
<p>"As the core contracts it goes deeper into instability until it collapses and begins to burn fuel explosively. The star then expands violently, but not enough to disrupt the whole star," Woosley said. "For stars between 90 and 130 solar masses, you get pulses. It hits this instability, violently expands, then radiates and contracts until it gets hotter and hits the instability again. It keeps going until it loses enough mass to be stable again."</p>
<p>Stars in this size range are very rare, especially in our own galaxy. But they may have been more common in the early universe. "Until recently, we would have said such stars don't exist. But any mechanism that could explain this event requires a very large mass," Woosley said.</p>
<p>Other researchers had suggested pair instability as a possible mechanism for some supernovae, but the idea of repeated explosions--called "pulsational pair instability"--is new. According to Woosley, the new mechanism can yield a wide variety of explosions.</p>
<p>"You could have anywhere from two to six explosions, and they could be weak or strong," he said. "A lot of variety is possible, and it gets even more complicated because what's left behind at the end is still about 40 solar masses, and it continues to evolve and eventually makes an iron core and collapses, so you can end up with a gamma-ray burst. The possibilities are very exciting."</p>
<p>This work was performed by the Computational Astrophysics Consortium supported by the Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) Program through the U.S. Department of Energy offices ASCR, HEP, NP, and NNSA, and also by NASA and by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research and Science Schools. At Los Alamos, this work was carried out under the auspices of the National Nuclear Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy.</p>

<p>UCSC has worked diligently in its 42-year history to build a campus that respects and preserves its spectacular environment. That's one reason why UCSC is universally recognized and consistently ranked as one of the most beautiful campuses in the world. It's also a reason why campus faculty and staff designated two existing parking lots as the site for the new Biomedical Sciences Facility and why the campus has designated 1,100 acres as open space in its new long-range plan.</p>

UCSC respects the right of all individuals to speak freely on our campus. The campus also has a responsibility to ensure that dissent and discourse do not interfere with the campus's academic and operational activities and that public gatherings and demonstrations are conducted in a safe manner. Toward that end, UCSC has "time-place-and-manner" policies that spell out our expectations and delineate areas appropriate for demonstrations.<br/>
<br/>
<p><strong>About protestors' confrontation with UCSC Police on November 7:</strong></p>
<p>. UCSC police officers were stationed on the Biomedical Sciences Facility site on Wednesday because they were asked to secure a heavily traveled pedestrian area made very dangerous by a predawn incident there. During the predawn hours, a group of people climbed trees, hoisted wooden platforms high above the ground, and, in the process, dislodged a number of heavy branches. Six of the individuals were detained before climbing into the trees, one was arrested, and two vehicles were towed. The campus police secured the areas under the trees.</p>
<p>. By early afternoon, a second protest occurred at another campus site. After those protestors marched to the first site, they engaged in a hostile confrontation with officers, who were positioned inside fencing. The fencing had been erected earlier that day to secure an unsafe site and preventing additional people from climbing the trees. The officers did not venture outside the secured area to confront protestors; protestors pushed down the fencing, confronting officers.</p>
<p><strong>About various subjects raised by protestors:</strong></p>
<p><u>Background on LRDP</u></p>
<p>. The faculty-comprised Strategic Futures Committee recommended in 2003 that the campus plan for the possibility of growth to 21,000 students by the year 2020. UCSC's 2005 Long-Range Development Plan (LRDP) was prepared in response to this recommendation. This potential growth, later reduced, was designed to serve the state by fostering the campus's academic development and increasing student capacity.</p>
<p>. The enrollment level-established as ceiling in the LRDP and used for environmental analysis in the EIR-was reduced to 19,500 by then Acting Chancellor Blumenthal. This was done in response to campus and community concerns about the impact of UCSC growth and in consultation with UCSC's Academic Senate. UC Regents approved this revised LRDP.</p>
<p>. The 2005 LRDP does not mandate that the campus grow by 4,500 students to a total of 19,500 in the 15 years leading up to 2020. Instead, the LRDP prepares the campus to anticipate the enrollment and workforce needs of a growing state population; the planning document provides a general physical blueprint for that level of growth should campus expansion be needed to serve future California students and fulfill the state's educational mission.</p>
<p>. The 2005 LRDP does not, as suggested, mandate development of 120 acres north of the existing campus core. Approximately 50 of the 120 acres mentioned are located in the existing campus core. If the Biomedical Research Facility is built, it would be constructed on 3 of those 50 acres. (These three acres are currently the site of two parking lots). In the 2005 LRDP, the remaining area-approximately 70 acres-are located north of the existing campus core. This acreage has been reduced from prior LRDPs-going back to the first one, in 1963.</p>
<p>. In the 2005 LRDP, existing and potential development would require approximately 75 fewer acres than was so designated in the previous LRDP (1988). The 2005 LRDP also designates approximately 250 more acres of open space than the previous plan did.</p>
<p><u>Student involvement in the LRDP process</u></p>
<p>. The process for producing an updated LRDP began in 2003, before many of today's students enrolled at UCSC. To suggest that students were not involved in the plan's creation is inaccurate. Students served on campus LRDP committees and produced a "student involvement" paper that presented their perspectives.</p>
<p><u>State investment in science and non-science fields</u></p>
<p>. Contrary to suggestions made by protestors, the Biomedical building-like all other academic buildings on this campus-is paid for by state funds (taxpayer dollars). State bond funds also have provided planning and construction money for the:</p>
<p>- Humanities and Social Sciences Facility, which opened last year, providing 51,140 asf of instructional and office space.</p>
<p>- Digital Arts Facility, now under construction to provide 27,000 asq of studio, instructional, and research space.</p>
<p>- McHenry Library Addition, under construction to provide space for a growing collection of print and electronic materials in the humanities, social sciences, the arts, and special collections-and an infrastructure to give students and faculty access to electronic resources and services.</p>
<p><u>Information on Biomedical Sciences Facility</u></p>
<p>. The environmental review for this building was conducted under the auspices of the 2005 LRDP. Because the 2005 LRDP has been stalled by litigation, the campus has no current timetable for construction of the Biomedical building.</p>
<p>. Community leaders, even some critics of UCSC's LRDP, believe that the Biomedical Sciences Facility will not only serve our students but generate meaningful research in areas such as public health and provide economic opportunities in biotechnology research in the Santa Cruz area.</p>
<p>. A research building, such as this one, provides opportunities for undergraduates and graduate students to participate in research and scholarly activities. Such facilities are essential for recruiting outstanding faculty, expanding programs such as UCSC's undergraduate major in health sciences, and attracting graduate students who will help meet the state's need for highly trained professionals.</p>

"The jury is the vanguard of the people's will," he said. "Increasingly, the United States is becoming so powerful it can impose its will around the world. People in these nations are arming themselves with the legal apparatus to resist oppression from their own governments, which are vulnerable to outside influence."</p><p>The former Soviet republics of Russia and Kazakhstan have introduced the jury system to resolve legal disputes, and the trend is sweeping across many nations in Asia, East Asia, Central America, and South America. For example, Mexico, South Korea, Japan, and China are transforming their legal systems to incorporate lay-jury trials.</p><p>Jury trials provide an open forum for the evaluation of criminal cases, and outcomes more likely reflect the public will, said Fukurai, adding that the jury system also makes the criminal justice process more transparent, reduces government corruption, and decreases the likelihood of wrongful convictions.</p><p>"The greatness of the jury system is that the government has to present evidence to the people," he said. Under the inquisitorial legal system, currently in place in Mexico, Japan, and many other nations, confessions have been considered the "queen of evidence." But documented confessions, which are inadmissible in the U.S.-style adversarial system of law because they are hearsay and can be coerced, can short-circuit the judicial process, he said. "Once police get a confession, they tend to get lazy," said Fukurai. "They don't look for corroborating evidence because they know the judge will accept the confession as evidence of guilt."</p><p>Mexico is in the process of adopting an oral and adversarial system in which jurors will be reinstated as the final arbiters of justice. Although the Mexican constitution has a provision for jury trials, nearly all criminal cases since the end of the Mexican revolution in 1929 have been decided by judges, not juries. "The adversarial system is better, because it allows jurors to hear testimony and see evidence themselves," said Fukurai. "Otherwise, when prosecutors can rely on getting a confession, that's considered the end of the job."</p><p>In Japan, confessions were central to four wrongful convictions in capital cases during the 1980s. Those cases were subsequently overturned, but public outrage and pressure from the economic sector generated demand for reforms, including reinstatement of jury trials and other forms of public legal participation, said Fukurai. By May 2009, Japan will introduce a system in which criminal cases will be heard by three professional and six lay judges. </p><p>The jury system also affords nations a degree of self-determination that's particularly valuable during times of social unrest. After China regained control of Hong Kong from Britain in 1997, Hong Kongers struggled for the right for those charged with treason, sedition, subversion, or other crimes against the government to be tried by an all-citizen jury. "Juries can be a forum for dissenting voices, because the community decides the fate of activists arrested for protesting government policies," said Fukurai. "The jury represents a check on the power of the government to restrict those voices, and it is also a check on external influence on their own government."</p><p>In South Korea, a grassroots movement against governmental policies allowing the U.S. military presence is growing, and lay-jury trials assure protesters a forum that will more closely reflect public opinion, said Fukurai. In January 2007, the South Korean Defense Ministry announced plans to use military juries, and in January 2008, South Korea will begin a five-year experiment with American-style jury trials. Change is also underway in China, where the government has bolstered the country's lay assessor system, in which legal disputes are evaluated by both lay and professional judges, rather than judges or panels of legal professionals alone.</p><p>Hurdles remain, however, including overcoming public reluctance to actually serve on juries. In the United States, a large majority of prospective jurors simply fail to report for service, and Fukurai conducted a survey in Japan two years ago that uncovered a similar aversion: 60 percent said they would be reluctant to serve on a jury. </p><p>Moreover, juror selection procedures can sway the makeup of judicial panels: In the United States, juror selection disfavors minorities, the poor, the young, the less educated, daily wage earners, and women, said Fukurai. "In Japan, jury trials were suspended by the military government in 1943 because only men 30 years old and over with property were allowed to serve, and no eligible jurors could afford to serve at the end of the war," he said.</p><p>In collaboration with a Chinese judge, Fukurai found that lay assessors are far more likely than the general population to be college graduates, and farmers rarely serve. Mexico's current proposal would actually restrict jury service to those who have college degrees. </p><p>Nevertheless, Fukurai is encouraged by the results of a 2006 survey he conducted in Dallas, Texas, of 2,500 prospective jurors. Although only 40 percent of them had actually served on a jury, the overwhelming majority of those who did serve said it was a very positive experience.</p><p>#####</p><p><b>Editor's Note</b>: Hiroshi Fukurai can be reached by e-mail at hfukurai@ucsc.edu.

The finding suggests that with better understanding of the physics involved, analysis techniques that operate in vacuums--such as mass spectrometry and studies of organic molecules in space--could yield far more information than they do now.</p>
<p>"Mass spectrometry of macromolecules was a huge breakthrough. But you're only getting one number from it, the mass of the molecule, and that's that," said Joshua Deutsch, professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In a paper published in the November 16 issue of <em>Physical Review Letters,</em> Deutsch analyzed the behavior of large molecules in a vacuum. He said that when long, chainlike molecules are released into a vacuum, they should oscillate in characteristic ways according to their makeup. By measuring those oscillations with electromagnetic sensors, scientists might someday be able to reconstruct details of the chemical structures of the molecules.</p>
<p>Many important biological molecules are macromolecules, including proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and nucleic acids like DNA. In the natural world, these polymers--long chains of repeating units connected by strong chemical bonds--are always in solution in our cells. So medical researchers tend to study them in solution.</p>
<p>As anyone who has tried to run in a pool can attest, water restricts movement. Tiny structures such as biological macromolecules lie suspended in a cell's fluid, like spaghetti in molasses, Deutsch said. Weak chemical attractions between the solution and the molecule often enlarge the molecule, holding it in extended positions.</p>
<p>But in a vacuum, Deutsch realized, there is no medium to dampen movement--only the internal forces within the molecule itself. He found that this internal friction leads to very different behavior from that of a molecule in solution.</p>
<p>Deutsch wrote a computer simulation of the physics involved in simplified molecules containing 128, 256, or 512 subunits arranged in a single chain. When he ran the model, he was amazed to see that points on the chain would periodically get closer, then farther apart, and continue in prolonged oscillations similar to the way the sides of a bell vibrate as it rings.</p>
<p>"It took me completely by surprise," Deutsch said. "No one had ever looked into this before, and based on what you see in solution you wouldn't expect the system to just ring and ring like that."</p>
<p>After more analysis, Deutsch realized that the answer could be explained by a simple concept several centuries old. "Turns out it's just Galilean invariance," Deutsch said, referring to the principle that objects moving in a vacuum don't slow down. This means that each subunit in a macromolecule feels pushes and pulls from its neighbors, but the overall movement of the molecule is not restricted by a solvent.</p>
<p>"This gives rise to a far less efficient damping than you'd get in solution," Deutsch said.</p>
<p>The oscillations are in the radio-frequency range and are strong enough, perhaps, to be detected in the vacuum chamber of a mass spectrometer, Deutsch said.</p>
<p>First developed in the early 20th century, mass spectrometers were for years confined to studying atoms and small molecules. Mass spectrometers work by accelerating molecules over a specified distance and measuring how long the journey takes. With good enough instruments, this reveals the mass of the particle.</p>
<p>Mass spectrometry of macromolecules at first faced a major obstacle: no one could develop a way to vaporize them intact. Then, in the early 1980s, a young Japanese electrical engineer named Koichi Tanaka discovered a method by accident after making a faulty lab preparation. He followed up on the mistake with more research, eventually developing a workable method for which he won the 2002 Nobel Prize in chemistry.</p>
<p>In the new paper, Deutsch suggested that a mass spectrometer outfitted with the proper instruments could measure the oscillations from a vaporized macromolecule. By comparing the measurements against known samples and theoretical predictions, researchers might learn much more about the molecule than just its mass. Characteristics such as the arrangement of bonds, placement of charges, or atomic composition could possibly be determined.</p>
<p>"For example, DNA, because it's a double helix, is much stiffer than a single chain," Deutsch said. "You ought to be able to measure that."</p>
<p>For now, Deutsch is keeping things simple. His models look at single strands composed of identical subunits, with electrical charges acting only at each end of the chain. This is a far cry from typical macromolecules, which are a tangle of chemical bonds, contain many subunits in varying sequences, and have charges dispersed along their length. But Deutsch believes in starting simply.</p>
<p>"I could add that all in right now, but what would I learn?" he said. "I want to work out the basics of this system. Then the experimentalists can take it from there."</p>

The award was designated as a We the People grant--a special recognition given by the NEH for model projects that advance the study, teaching, and understanding of American history and culture. </p><p>							</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91540ccd8072704601a012ff3007b4d0"><name>1750</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus seeing recycling boom</title><summary>Recycling has been on the upswing for the past two years, but the campus has experienced a surge in the practice since students arrived with the start of this year's academic term.</summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-5312; gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>UCSC Recycling Program</keywords><description>Recycling has been on the upswing for the past two years, but the campus has experienced a surge in the practice since students arrived with the start of this year's academic term.</description><start-date>1195110000000</start-date><display-name>Campus seeing recycling boom...</display-name><path>/2007/11/1750</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/11/1750</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338458779</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338458779</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/11/images/recycling.workers.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/11/images/recycling.workers.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>recycling.workers.300.jpg</name><file-size>15253</file-size><width>300</width><height>260</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Juancarlos Calderon, recycling worker, left, and Trevor Krapf, student recycling coordinator, empty bins on a recent weekday. </image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/11/images/recycling.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/11/images/recycling.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>recycling.300.jpg</name><file-size>20400</file-size><width>300</width><height>231</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>A large container at the recycling yard shows the kinds of materials the campus hopes to give new life. (Photos by Gwen Mickelson)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Workers pulling up to campus recycling containers on their weekly rounds have lately been greeted with an unusual sight: Full bins. Packed bins. Bins that are stuffed to the bursting point.</p><p>Recycling has been on the upswing for the past two years, but the campus has experienced a surge in the practice since students arrived with the start of this year's academic term, according to Recycling Coordinator Dave Wade. Recycling workers are having to give housing areas more bins and haul more material than before to the City of Santa Cruz recycling center, which handles most of the campus's recycling, said Wade. </p><p>The numbers for 2007 aren't available yet, but Wade and his staff at the UCSC Recycling Program estimate the university's total recycling could jump from 1,277 tons in 2006 to 1,500 tons this year--an increase of nearly 18 percent. </p><p>"We just know that at every stop we go to pick up recycling, there's more material," said Wade. </p><p>Part of the reason is UC Santa Cruz Dining's effort to get campus dining locations "green" certified by the Monterey Bay Area Green Business Program, Wade said. The program sets standards for conserving resources, preventing pollution, and minimizing waste.</p><p>Porter/Kresge Dining Hall, Cowell/Stevenson Dining Hall, and University Catering were recently certified; Crown/Merrill Dining Hall and Banana Joe's Café were already certified. In the works for future certification are Owl's Nest Café, Terra Fresca, and College 9/10 Dining Hall.</p><p>But Wade guessed that another reason for the upswing is the "broader conversation" society is engaging in about sustainability and global warming.</p><p>"Recycling is something you can do," Wade said. "You don't need to get a Ph.D., be a doctor or lawyer, or be elected to high office. It's like turning the lights off, wearing warmer clothes, or taking public transportation. It's a grassroots thing."</p><p>That the campus is recycling more is a serendipitous stroke: UCSC is striving to increase dramatically the amount of stuff it diverts from the landfill. UC Office of the President has mandated that all 10 UC campuses recycle half of all collected materials by June, according to Wade. Right now, the diversion rate at UCSC is about 32 percent. </p><p>To accomplish the increased diversion rate, "we're working to add equipment and staff and looking at different aspects of our operations and how we might make them more efficient and capture more material that's currently getting thrown away," said Wade. </p><p>UCSC is also doing increasing amounts of green waste recycling--items such as grass clippings and landscape trimmings--using a debris hauling roll-off-box truck it acquired a little over a year ago, said Wade. </p><p>By state law, every city and county has to have a recycling program, and UCOP concurs, said Wade. In fact, UC is attempting to mirror the state's policies because it recognizes the value of recycling, he said. </p><p>"It's a good neighbor thing," said Wade. "It's the right thing to do."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

This program will benefit organizations such as New Horizons school for homeless children and the Walnut Avenue Women's Center. The group is also recruiting volunteers to serve on stand-by to buy gifts for those whose names have not been selected. For more information call Nicole Teutschel or Hilary Sisson at (831) 459-3363, or e-mail <a href="mailto:volunteer@ucsc.edu">volunteer@ucsc.edu</a>.</p><p>Other faculty, staff, and students are participating in Volunteer Centers of Santa Cruz County's Adopt A Family program. The center selects and provides donors with information about a family, and adopters provide a new toy and article of clothing for each child, gift certificates for food, and a family gift such as blankets, towels, or dishes. For more information, call (831) 427-5075.</p><p>Contributors to the Toys for Tots program may drop off unwrapped new toys of any kind at the UCSC fire or police station Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., starting right after Thanksgiving and going through December 20. The toys will go to local needy children. Donated toys should be in their original packaging. The firefighters suggest throwing a holiday toy-donation party; they can pick up the toys after the party. For more information or toy pickup, contact Troy Souza at (831) 459-3473.</p><p>The Christmas Project serves both children and adults. Contributors choose the name of someone from a Santa Cruz County migrant worker family. First names and their gift requests are displayed on a Christmas tree in the Educational Opportunity Programs Office of the Academic Resources Center. "Most of the adults are asking for warm clothes," said Larry Trujillo, executive director of Student Academic Support Services. Gifts must be selected by Friday, December 14. For more information, contact Trujillo at (831) 459-3630.</p><p>Faculty and staff are encouraged to donate to the annual Second Harvest Food Bank campaign to help feed people of all ages. <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/messages/text.asp?pid=1748">Letters</a> and donation envelopes arrived in campus mailboxes last week. Organizers urge donations by November 30, but they'll be taken until campus closure. The goal this year is to collect 75,000 pounds of food and cash-equivalent donations toward a communitywide goal of 1.6 million pounds. Nonperishable foods and cash donations are both welcome. Donations may be sent via Campus Mail. For every dollar donated, Second Harvest is able to distribute more than $9 worth of food. A $10 donation provides a family of four with an average of 50 meals. To have food donation bags dropped off, call (831) 459-4852.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9154151d8072704601a012ffad7ba702"><name>1755</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Norrie's at the Arboretum to hold Holiday Open House Dec. 1</title><summary>Norrie's gift shop at the Arboretum will hold its annual Holiday Open House, featuring a great selection of gifts and decorations, on December 1 from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</summary><description>Norrie's gift shop at the Arboretum will hold its annual Holiday Open House, featuring a great selection of gifts and decorations, on December 1 from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</description><start-date>1195196400000</start-date><display-name>Norrie's at the Arboretum...</display-name><path>/2007/11/1755</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/11/1755</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338460904</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338460904</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/11/images/norries.250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/11/images/norries.250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>norries.250.jpg</name><file-size>62003</file-size><width>250</width><height>191</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>UCSC staff and faculty will receive 10 percent off everything at Norrie's gift shop during December.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Norrie's gift shop at the Arboretum will hold its annual Holiday Open House on December 1 from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. And as an enticement to faculty and staff to do their shopping at Norrie's, the shop will offer them a 10 percent discount for the month of December. </p><p>The shop is filled with items for the holidays and decorations for the season, including dried flower and succulent wreaths.

They turned to Andrew Fisher, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>A hydrogeologist, Fisher studies the interactions between surface water and ground water, and over the past decade his research has focused on the Pajaro Valley. Recently, for example, he investigated how Corralitos Creek and the Pajaro River contribute to the recharge of the region's underground reservoir, or aquifer.</p>
<p>The Pajaro Valley aquifer provides more than 90 percent of the water used by the area's residents, businesses, and farmers. Fisher reported to the community forum that this crucial water supply is in grave danger of running out.</p>
<p>"Water levels in the aquifer have been plummeting for the past 20 to 30 years," he said. "Even worse, during wet years the water levels have not come back."</p>
<p>The withdrawal of water from an aquifer faster than it's replaced results in "overdraft." Just as overdraft of an important bank account can cause damage to a business, overdraft of an aquifer can irreversibly harm the environment. One consequence can be subsidence or sinking of the land. Near the coast, seawater can move into the aquifer--a growing problem in parts of the Pajaro Valley.</p>
<p>"Parts of this aquifer may never recover in our lifetimes," Fisher noted.</p>
<p>How did the situation get so dire? In recent decades, demand for water increased dramatically as the Pajaro Valley's agricultural industry and population both grew. Currently, people are pumping about three times more ground water than they should, according to the latest studies. Many people mistakenly believe they can take and use all the water that's available.</p>
<p>"You can't capture all of it," Fisher said. "The amount you can safely pump before you get overdraft is much less than that."</p>
<p>Also, certain locations are worse than others for tapping into the aquifer. "If you pump near the coast, that will have a greater impact immediately on seawater intrusion," Fisher said. "But the basin is one entity and the problem is occurring because of decades of pumping all over the basin."</p>

<p>The overdraft problem was acknowledged in 1994, when the Pajaro Valley Water Management Agency (PVWMA) adopted a Basin Management Plan. The plan was revised in 2002. More recently, the County of Santa Cruz has been considering a declaration of a groundwater emergency and a freeze on permits for new wells. Due to political conflict and lack of funds, however, the PVWMA has been unable to take much action to preserve the aquifer, according to Fisher. Since 1997, he has served as a technical advisor on several PVWMA committees that examined ground water conditions in the basin.</p>
<p>"You can think of the overdraft as a giant hole in the aquifer that needs to be refilled," Fisher explained. "If we commit to this tomorrow, it will still take decades for this basin to recover."</p>
<p>Fisher has been invited to comment on the overdraft situation at the next meeting of the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, November 20.</p>
<p>Research by Fisher's group and colleagues has determined that seepage from Corralitos Creek and the Pajaro River may contribute as much as 40 percent of the annual recharge to the aquifer. However, parts of these rivers tend to run dry during the summer. When rainfall returns, the soil surrounding the riverbeds must reabsorb water in order to reestablish flow to the aquifer.</p>
<p>"When these rivers go dry it's a lost opportunity," Fisher suggested. "If it were possible to keep these rivers running the entire year, the basin might get more recharge."</p>
<p>Fisher's research team has begun studies of the PVWMA's Harkins Slough Recharge Project to investigate how well it's performing and whether it's possible at that site to further increase the flow of surface water to the aquifer. The team uses physical and chemical techniques to track ground-water recharge and plans to build computer models of how water flows through the area.</p>
<p>The PVWMA will need to do a lot of monitoring and "adaptive management," adjusting their projects and plans as new information comes in, according to Fisher. Aquifer recharge rates might be reduced by climate change in the coming decades. Most regional climate models predict that in the coming decades the region will receive more intense rainfall during shorter periods, which would lead to more runoff to the ocean and less percolation into the ground. Higher temperatures are also expected to increase the evaporation of water into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>"Water is constantly in motion and the two parts of the hydrological cycle that are hardest to measure are evapotranspiration and ground-water recharge," Fisher said.</p>
<p>Still, a more accurate and detailed computer model of the Pajaro Valley's hydrogeology is on the way. Fisher is serving on an advisory committee overseeing a new, regional ground-water model being developed by scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey. Due out in early 2008, the model is expected to provide a powerful tool for the PVWMA and the public to use in monitoring and evaluating water resource projects. And it could be updated to account for changes in rainfall patterns and in local land use.</p>
<p>"There are no easy answers, and no good guys and bad guys," said Fisher. "It's such a big problem, everyone is going to have to contribute to a solution."</p>
<p>A range of options is being considered, because no single action can solve the problem. Increasing water conservation and recycling are obvious solutions with widespread support. More controversial is the proposal to import water from the Central Valley. The PVWMA determined that the local water supply would not be enough to meet future demand and that shortages would likely cause severe disruptions to the economy. The agency has an allocation of water from the California Aquaduct that it could legally tap into.</p>
<p>To do this, however, would require costly investment in infrastructure, such as pipelines. And these pipelines might simply link the Pajaro Valley to other thirsty parts of the state, where people are also worried about future water supplies.</p>
<p>"The reality is that many of California's aquifers are now in overdraft; it's a huge problem statewide," said Fisher.</p>
<p>The community forum, sponsored by the PVWMA, will continue on Thursday, December 6 at 7 p.m. at the Watsonville Women's Club located at 12 Brennan Street. An agenda and list of speakers are available on the <a href="http://www.pvwma.dst.ca.us">PVWMA web site</a>.</p>

Bush awarded a 2007 National Humanities Medal to UCSC alumnus Victor Davis Hanson on November 15 during a ceremony held in the White House East Room. Hanson was one of nine Americans honored for their "exemplary contributions to the humanities" and for their scholarship, preservation efforts, philanthropy, and literary works.</p>
<p>The National Humanities Medal, first awarded in 1989 as the Charles Frankel Prize, honors individuals or groups whose work "has deepened the nation's understanding of the humanities, broadened our citizens' engagement with the humanities, or helped preserve and expand Americans' access to important resources in the humanities." Over the last decade, the National Humanities Medal has been awarded to only 98 individuals and 7 organizations. Medal recipients do not compete for this award but are specially selected by the President for their lifelong achievements in their diverse areas of expertise. Previous award winners include Bernard Lewis, Judith "Miss Manners" Martin, Madeleine L'Engle, Harvey Mansfield, and John Updike.</p>
<p>Hanson is the author of hundreds of articles, book reviews, scholarly papers, and newspaper editorials on matters ranging from Greek, agrarian and military history to foreign affairs, domestic politics, and contemporary culture. He has also written or edited 16 books; his latest, <em>A War Like No Other: How the Athenians and Spartans Fought the Peloponnesian War</em>, was published by Random House in October 2005 and named one of the <em>New York Times</em>' Notable 100 Books of 2006.</p>

Now, the program has ballooned to 22 vans transporting campus employees from as near as Live Oak and as far-flung as Palo Alto. </p><p>For accomplishments in reducing single-passenger auto use such as this, the United Way honored UCSC's Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) Department as a "Community Hero" at its 2007 Community Assessment Project Year 13 press conference and celebration November 19, held at Holy Cross Parish Hall in Santa Cruz. </p><p>The Community Assessment Project study reports annually on the status of Santa Cruz County issues, ranging from the economy and health care to crime, education, and the environment. The project also each year honors county residents, or Community Heroes, who have contributed to the community through their work or volunteering.</p><p>Getting the recognition felt "great," said Larry Pageler, director of TAPS.</p><p>"Our transportation programs are a model that can be used at other universities, but also in the community," Pageler said. </p><p>The Community Assessment Project of Santa Cruz County (CAP) is a collaborative project to measure and improve the quality of life in the county. It's been sponsored over the past 13 years by a consortium of public and private health, education, human service, and civic organizations convened by the United Way of Santa Cruz County.</p><p>Twenty-five Community Heroes were recognized at the ceremony in the categories of economy, education, health, natural environment, public safety, and social environment. TAPS was honored in the category of natural environment. </p><p>This year, United Way got more nominations for Community Heroes than ever before, with more than 100 suggestions coming in across all categories, said Mary Lou Goeke, executive director of United Way of Santa Cruz County.</p><p>TAPS was nominated for the award by Virginia Johnson, chief executive officer of nonprofit environmental consultancy Ecology Action. </p><p>"They do a wonderful job of transportation demand management--managing the demand of the trips coming onto the campus, parking on the campus, and mobility around the campus," said Johnson. "They have the right mix of incentives and disincentives to get folks to really embrace sustainable transportation." </p><p>Enrollment at UCSC has increased 30 percent since fall 2000, but average daily vehicle traffic on campus has remained about the same, according to Pageler.</p><p>UCSC's transportation work has implications beyond the campus, he said. </p><p>The university's partnership with car-sharing service Zipcar, vanpools, bike shuttles, and use of transit "can translate into better transportation options for the entire county, the region, and the state," said Pageler. </p><p>Next up for the department is a focus on reducing the threat of global warming.</p><p>"How can we better determine where we can spend our money to get the best benefit in greenhouse gas reduction?" said Pageler. </p><p>When asked how the department had won the award, Pageler credited the "terrific staff." </p><p>"The people who drive the buses, get the grants, and manage parking at the events," he said. "It's been terrific to have such a wonderful and supportive staff, and a campus that truly cares about these issues."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915420be8072704601a012ffb0b7f048"><name>1762</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Exceptions to campus holiday closure</title><start-date>1195542000000</start-date><display-name>Exceptions to campus holiday...</display-name><path>/2007/11/1762</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/11/1762</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338463873</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338463873</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>News Briefs</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As in the past, the UCSC campus will close during the holiday season in an effort to conserve energy at a time when university business is generally slow. This year the campus will be closed from Saturday, December 22, 2007 through Tuesday, January 1, 2008, re-opening on Wednesday, January 2, 2008.</p><p>The campus community is reminded to turn off lights, shut down computers and other office equipment, and close exterior windows before leaving for the break.</p><p>During the closure, some housing areas and other buildings will remain open. Laboratory buildings will be partially operational due to the special needs of researchers and scientists, and some campus units' work schedules may require staffing during all or part of the closure. Fire, police, and environmental health and safety services will be provided to the campus community during this period, along with necessary utilities and other essential services.</p><p>Once unit heads have concurrence from their Principal Officer, they are asked to notify Physical Plant directly of their plans to remain open or staffed during part or all of the closure. Notifications should be made via email to mcmanusd@ucsc.edu, by campus mail to Deanna McManus at Building and Utilities Services, or by fax (9-1404) no later than Friday December 14, 2006, and should include the specific dates that offices will be occupied, as well as the number of occupants. This will ensure that open areas will receive necessary services during this period when most faculty, staff, and students are on vacation.</p><p>It is important to note, however, that building temperatures in underutilized areas will generally be reduced. Therefore, please advise staff to dress appropriately during this time. Unit heads should also notify their appropriate service centers for time and payroll accounting purposes.  Finally, faculty are asked to announce the closure broadly to their graduate students who may plan on working throughout the closure.</p><p>If you have facilities-related questions or would like further information on campus closure exceptions, please call Physical Plant at 9-3447.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>Campus Community</audience><admin>Ilse Kolbus, Director of Physical Plant</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915422728072704601a012ffa4f87633"><name>1763</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Dickens Holiday Evening set for November 30</title><start-date>1195455600000</start-date><display-name>Dickens Holiday Evening set...</display-name><path>/2007/11/1763</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/11/1763</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338464306</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338464306</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2007/11/images/dickens_2007.jpg</path><link>site://news/2007/11/images/dickens_2007.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dickens_2007.jpg</name><file-size>56704</file-size><width>250</width><height>305</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The annual Dickens Holiday Evening is free and everyone is welcome</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Friends of the UCSC Library and the Dickens Project will present the annual Dickens Holiday Evening on Friday, November 30, from 5 to 6:30 p.m. at UCSC's McHenry Library Foyer.

Between one and two dozen others have established an encampment on the ground directly below the trees.</p><p>They are demonstrating against the campus's 2005 Long-Range Development Plan, the proposed construction of the Biomedical Sciences building, and a number of other issues.</p><p>The purpose of this message is to explain what the campus has done to respond to this protest and to describe why I believe the current situation continues to be unacceptable.</p><p>Following the first day of this protest on November 7, Chancellor Blumenthal and I immediately asked staff to make every effort to engage the protestors in dialogue. Our goal was:</p><p>* To reduce the impact this demonstration is having on the safe and productive operation of the campus;</p><p>* And to do so in a manner that does not require further confrontation by exercising the campus community's tradition of communicating respectfully about our differences.</p><p>Toward that end, Student Affairs staff members have been a daily presence on the site. They have attempted to speak to those few students there about health and safety issues; staff have also informed students about the manner in which demonstrations are permitted on our campus and appropriate channels to address legitimate issues. And staff have also communicated with students about the potential consequences of violating campus policies.</p><p>Twice a day, UCSC police have informed all protestors there--including those on the site who are not affiliated with the campus--about trespassing laws, campus regulations that prohibit camping, and policies that govern the "time, place, and manner" of protests on our campus.</p><p>While our efforts in this regard have not been met with cooperation from either the tree sitters or people encamped below, we are not yet ready to abandon this outreach.</p><p>Still, Chancellor Blumenthal and I remain deeply concerned about many aspects of this particular protest:</p><p>* This protest is in violation of campus policies that are designed to protect the rights of all members of the UCSC community, including the faculty, students, and staff whose work is impacted.</p><p>* My office has received numerous reports that the protestors have been disruptive and disrespectful to people who work and study in the area. In addition, these protestors interrupted the campus's recent Students of Color Conference, requiring that conference hosts summon campus police for assistance.</p><p>* Student Affairs' requests that the site be kept clean, sanitary, and safe have been largely ignored. This is an issue not only for the people on the site, but for people who study, work, or just walk past that area.</p><p>* The protestors, some of whom hide their faces in bandannas, are an intimidating presence for prospective students and families visiting the campus.</p><p>* University property in that area has been damaged and stolen, and nearby buildings have been defaced with graffiti.</p><p>* The two parking lots used by faculty, staff, and graduate students there have essentially been off limits, and access to disabled parking spaces in those lots has been blocked by this demonstration.</p><p>* Protest literature has singled out individual faculty members on the basis of their scientific research.</p><p>* Because fire alarms in the area have been repeatedly pulled and the demonstrators there have been unruly at times, the nearby Physical Sciences Building has been locked during the day for security purposes. This lockdown has denied students and others regular access to faculty, teaching assistants, and even classrooms.</p><p>Chancellor Blumenthal and I recognize that reasonable people can have very different views on the need for UCSC growth and the manner in which that growth should occur. We respect people's rights to disagree--as long as those disagreements are expressed in a manner that demonstrates respect for all members of our community.</p><p>This demonstration fails to meet that key requirement.</p><p>We've established the following web site to keep the campus community informed about this matter:</p><p><a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/protest/biomedical/">http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/protest/biomedical/</a></p><p>I invite you to communicate your thoughts to me about this protest.

This year's gathering featured keynote speaker Al Gore.</p><p>Billed as an "evening of civic engagement showcasing bold models for sustainable social change," the forum featured a VIP reception, Gore's speech, and a networking session that brought together more than 600 business leaders, politicians, entrepreneurs, and others. </p><p>The Full Circle Fund is a membership organization devoted to cultivating new community leaders and creating "lasting social change in the Bay Area." Members share their time, money, skills, and connections with nonprofits, businesses, and government agencies. Grantmaking efforts have been focused on the areas of affordable housing, education, and technology.

<p>The gene produces a type of protein previously thought to play an important role in the immune system. However, the new findings suggest that these proteins, known as defensins, may be involved in regulating other important processes in the body, including pigmentation, energy balance, and production of glucocorticoid hormones.</p>
<p>"This study has uncovered a new level of regulation in the body. We don't know yet, but it could have implications for understanding genetic factors involved in obesity, diabetes, and related diseases," said Glenn Millhauser, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Millhauser and three graduate students in his laboratory--Matthew Nix, Darren Thompson, and Bin Yu--are coauthors of the paper describing the new findings, published online November 2 in the journal <em>Science.</em> The study was led by a team of geneticists at Stanford University.</p>
<p>The determination of coat color in dogs has long been a mystery. While most mammals share the same genetic mechanism to determine coat color, dogs seemed to be an exception. The Stanford researchers, led by geneticist Greg Barsh, identified a new gene in dogs that acts in addition to the two main coat-color genes recognized in other mammals. To their surprise, the new gene makes a beta-defensin protein belonging to the large and variable family of proteins called defensins, thought to play a role in fighting infections.</p>
<p>To find out how the beta-defensin operates in the determination of coat color, the researchers needed purified samples of the active protein. But defensins are notoriously difficult to work with in the laboratory. So Barsh turned to Millhauser, a longtime collaborator, to produce a supply of properly structured beta-defensin for laboratory studies.</p>
<p>The researchers found that the protein engages the melanocortin pathway, a circuit of molecular interactions that controls the type of melanin and amount of cortisol produced by the body. Barsh and Millhauser have been interested in this pathway because it determines not only skin and hair color, but also stress adaptation and weight regulation.</p>
<p>"This gives us a new way of viewing the processes controlled by the melanocortin system. We suspect that defensins will turn out to have a role in all aspects of melanocortin signalling, not just coat color," Millhauser said.</p>
<p>The discovery of a new participant in this pathway opens up additional areas for drug research, said the article's co-first author, Sophie Candille, a former graduate student in Barsh's lab.</p>
<p>Candille visited five Bay Area dog shows over six months to gather hundreds of samples by gently swabbing the inside of the dogs' cheeks with a brush. The project began a few years ago with boxers and Great Danes of different colors. Candille identified a region of the genome that differed between them. Then she moved on to 36 other breeds, ranging from Large Munsterlanders to miniature schnauzers.</p>
<p>"Looking within one breed rapidly identifies the general region, but looking at different breeds allows you to home in on the gene that's responsible," Barsh said.</p>
<p>Candille's work narrowed the genome region to a gene that makes a beta-defensin protein. One version of the beta-defensin gene produces yellow dogs, a mutant version of the gene produces black. Co-first author Chris Kaelin went on to prove it. When he inserted the dog gene in transgenic mice, their fur grew out black.</p>
<p>But the finding's relevance extends far beyond fur color. The beta-defensin gene is a member of the unusually large and variable defensin family of genes. A human can have between 40 and 50 different defensin genes; dogs can have up to 46.</p>
<p>Though researchers had assumed the defensin proteins were microbe fighters, Barsh isn't so sure. "We really have very little evidence that defensins do much in terms of defending," he said. "The genetic approach is more agnostic, and suggests that defensins have additional or alternative functions outside the immune system."</p>
<p>Barsh and Millhauser's immediate plans are to learn more about what human defensins do. A longer-term application is to discover whether defensins will serve as templates for drugs.</p>
<p>Other collaborators in the study were former Stanford graduate student Julie Kerns, who verified that typical mammalian coat color genetics were not operative in dogs; mouse geneticist Bruce Cattanach, who also breeds boxers and helped recruit many samples; and Sheila Schmutz, a dog geneticist at the University of Saskatchewan and a Large Munsterlander breeder.</p>
<p>The research was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health.</p>

Protests that began with frightening violence and with graffiti, vandalism, and false fire alarms have given way to a lower-level buzz, with the continued unsafe presence of thousands of pounds of people and materials up in trees near the core of Science Hill, the blockage of a parking lot including all of the handicapped and medical parking for the Physical Sciences Building, the environmentally destructive removal of deadfall wood from the ravines, the exposure of grounds staff to human waste, and the occasional threatening encounter with masked and unidentified squatters.  As the recent message from EVC Kliger emphasized, the current situation is intolerable. While the campus leadership continues their discussions with the protesters, and works towards what we all hope will be a peaceful resolution, I wanted to share some of my own thoughts.</p><p>The goals of the protests are not sharply defined. Statements point to general campus growth, the lack of an ethnic studies department, concern over the future of the campus trailer park, unhappiness with the University's role in the management of the weapons labs, and general discontent with the Regents.  But I believe that at the core of the protests is a disagreement over the role of science at UC Santa Cruz.</p><p>The immediate flash point is the development of the Biomedical Sciences Building. It is important to put this building in context.  First, the campus has recently completed several major construction projects, including a new humanities and social sciences complex, and significant new student housing capacity. Other projects now underway include an expansion of McHenry Library that is by some measures the biggest project ever undertaken on campus, a new building for Digital Arts, and new faculty housing.  Of these recent projects, only Biomedical Sciences is focused on science.</p><p>Second, the building committee, which included student members, has designed a "green" lab building to be placed on an already-disturbed site, and sized and oriented to preserve as many existing trees as possible. The building plan includes replanting, to replace the second-growth redwoods that are currently the focus of the tree sitters.</p><p>Finally, the building will primarily house biology and chemistry faculty who we need to hire to meet the needs of the students who are already here. In this respect, the protesters have a valid point.  We have far more biology majors than we did a decade ago, with a faculty size that is essentially unchanged, leading to many more students per faculty member.  We must hire more life scientists, and we can only do that if we can provide them with office and laboratory space. Our only real option is to limit access to a UC science education to the next generation of students, meeting the needs of neither our students nor the State of California.</p><p>These facts are lost in the materials and press statements made by the anti-science protesters, who paint an unrecognizable picture of science as a shadowy world controlled by military and corporate puppetmasters. In truth, most of the funding for our division comes from the state, from peer-reviewed federal grants, and from private gifts by individuals and foundations. There is no significant corporate or military funding for the construction of Biomedical Sciences.  I am particularly disturbed by the way that individual faculty are named and characterized in the literature and public statements of the protesters.</p><p>We must resist these attempts to dehumanize science and to alienate it from the rest of the university. Math and science have been at the core of the liberal arts since antiquity, and the profound importance of science as a way of understanding our world is something we hope that every UC Santa Cruz student will encounter and appreciate. Biology is the most popular grouping of majors on campus; these and other students in the sciences are as much Banana Slugs as those who are now claiming to represent the "dream of radical political transformation" of a mythical past.</p><p>I know a great many of the people on Science Hill, and I know how deeply you are engaged not just in your science and teaching, but also in the social and political challenges we face. I know many of you who volunteer your time and give your money towards environmental action and poverty reduction, not to mention in support of arts and culture such as Shakespeare Santa Cruz and educational programs such as the marine science outreach at Long Marine Lab. I know of colleagues here engaged at the national level in discussions on ethics in science, and I have myself spent considerable time and energy in Oakland successfully protecting UC's principles of open access in research against federal pressures after the attacks of 9/11.  I do not recognize the caricatures of the "corporatized" scientists described in the "Long Range Resistance" materials.</p><p>It is the responsibility of every one of us to speak out in the face of ignorance and fear, and to refuse to tolerate destructive or threatening behavior. I know that we have differing opinions within our community on some important questions, including whether UC Santa Cruz should continue to grow. But I also believe that we have shared values rooted in the ideals of the university and of our disciplines.  These include the importance of open debate and discussion, the willingness to question both our data and our assumptions, and the protection of the academic freedom of our colleagues to pursue their research unthreatened.</p><p>I would like to encourage each of you to make a special effort to engage with your colleagues around campus -- students, staff and faculty -- and with your neighbors in the community, to talk about the tremendous work we are doing here on Science Hill.  Let people know about our research into the fundamental building blocks of matter, and about the structure of the Universe. Let people know about our work on the causes and effects of global warming, and our more local efforts to understand and protect the environment of the Central Coast. Let people know about our programs like Cal Teach, training the next generation of high school math and science teachers, and Health Sciences, training students to meet the health care needs of a multicultural state. And most importantly, let people know about the important work being done by those who will be in the new Biomedical Sciences Building: studying cholera, heavy metal pollution, and other health scourges of the developing world; understanding Alzheimer's and neurodegenerative diseases; decoding the normal functioning of cells, and how those functions go awry in cancer; and advancing the genomic techniques that will one day allow both highly personalized, safer, and more effective medicines and a better understanding of the diversity of life on Earth.</p><p>At this time of Thanksgiving, I am grateful for your patience over the last few weeks, and particularly proud of our Science Hill community.

They belong to bull kelp, a giant seaweed that spreads glistening brown fronds across the water, sheltering dozing sea otters. In winter storms, the plants' 60-foot-long stems rip loose from the sea floor and wash ashore like abandoned rigging.</p>
<p>A common sight north of Santa Cruz, bull kelp (<em>Nereocystis luetkeana</em>) is the most abundant kind of kelp in Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska. Its cousin, giant kelp (<em>Macrocystis</em> species), predominates to the south. Both of these kelps are known for being rapid growers, sometimes adding a foot or more of new foliage per day. This copious production has made kelp popular among commercial harvesters, who use knives or mechanical mowers to trim the top four feet or so from the plant.</p>
<p>Kelp was prized early on as an ingredient in glassmaking, and extracts are now widely used in foods, cosmetics, fertilizers, agricultural feeds, and alternative medicines. To date, the great majority of harvesting has been directed at giant kelp, which tends to grow in warmer, more placid waters. The more streamlined bull kelp tends to grow in stronger currents and in waters exposed to high surf, where harvesting is difficult or dangerous.</p>
<p>But as demand grows for kelp extracts, harvesters may begin to target bull kelp. If so, there may be cause for concern, according to biologists at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"We don't know much about bull kelp, but we do know it is very different from giant kelp. We should proceed with caution," said Yuri Springer, a former postdoctoral researcher at UCSC. Springer, who is now with the California Department of Public Health, was lead author of a recent review of bull kelp in North America that summarized scientific studies, harvesting records, and existing laws.</p>
<p>In addition to Springer, the study's authors include Mark Carr, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC; former UCSC postdoctoral researcher Cynthia Hays; and Megan Mackey of the Pacific Marine Conservation Council.</p>
<p>Their report highlighted important differences between giant kelp and bull kelp, including giant kelp's ability to live for several years and grow fronds along its whole length--a feature that helps it shrug off the effects of harvesting. By contrast, bull kelp plants usually die each winter and start again as sprouts in the spring. If they're cut near the floating head--technically, the "pneumatocyst"--the plant won't grow back and, depending on the time of year, won't have a chance to release its spores, from which new plants grow. Over time, this could shrink the whole kelp patch.</p>
<p>"Scuba diving in a giant kelp forest, it's difficult to swim between plants because you get tangled up in all the fronds. Whereas bull kelp looks like a forest of hundreds of bare stems rising up to the surface," Springer said.</p>
<p>Fortunately, commercial interest is still low and harvesting regulations are reasonably strict in most states, notably California and Washington. Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, and British Columbia combined have issued a total of 20 permits to harvest bull kelp and have recorded less than 350 tons of harvested bull kelp per year, according to the report. By comparison, about 52,000 tons of giant kelp were harvested in California alone in 2006, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service, down from peak harvests of more than 170,000 tons per year in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Oregon is the most lenient state. It sets no limits on bull kelp harvest, although at present only one commercial harvester is registered. In addition to commercial harvest, personal harvest is allowed in all states and largely goes unreported. Springer said that better record keeping would be very useful in determining baseline knowledge about bull kelp, in case commercial harvesting does take off.</p>
<p>He also urged states to work together to arrive at consistent harvest regulations. "You can cross the Washington-Oregon border--it's just an invisible line in the water--and suddenly the harvesting regulations are very different. There's no biological rhyme or reason for that. It would be nice if the regulations had more biological meaning," he said.</p>
<p>Springer's report was funded by the Lenfest Ocean Program, established in July 2004 by the Lenfest Foundation at the Pew Charitable Trusts. The organization supports research in ocean sciences, particularly fisheries, with an emphasis on formulating policy-relevant solutions to ocean problems. The report is available from the Lenfest Foundation <a href="http://www.lenfestocean.org/publications/managing_bull_kelp.html">web site</a>.</p>

But a new book by American Studies professor Forrest Robinson sheds new light on the renowned author's tormented moral life.</p><p>The Author-Cat: Clemens's Life in Fiction (Fordham University Press) is a culmination of more than 25 years of research by Robinson on Samuel Clemens--who is better known by his pen name, Mark Twain. A critical psychobiography, the book frames Twain's work in terms of major American social issues, particularly slavery. It is a belated sequel to Robinson's 1986 book In Bad Faith: The Dynamics of Deception in Mark Twain's America, in which he talks about the ways in which Clemens's major fiction both addresses and denies the moral burden of slavery in American culture.</p><p>"This is a book about a man deeply troubled by what he believes are his own moral failures," said Robinson. "It's about guilt; he never got over the fact that he lived in a slave culture as a child and was persuaded there was nothing really wrong going on."</p><p>Although Clemens was motivated near the end of his life to write an autobiography that purportedly contained what he considered the flaws in both his character and behavior, Robinson notes that book--published posthumously--reveals very little about either. In contrast, Robinson argues, it is actually in Clemens's fiction that he inadvertently reveals his true colors. </p><p>As Robinson notes in the preface, ".Clemens's potent confessional impulse--to reveal what he regarded as the worst of himself to posterity--found its fruition not in his copious autobiographical writings, but rather in his travel books and major fiction. He was most free with the dark truth, I have found, when he was least aware he was disclosing it."</p><p>Robinson includes a letter to a friend in which Clemens confesses that the act of writing an autobiography is like the behavior of a cat trying to cover up and hide its waste--it can't be done. Robinson contends that Clemens wrote out of a driving need to come to terms with his past experiences--not by memorializing the past, but rather by transforming it. Hence the title of Robinson's book, The Author-Cat.</p><p>Robinson said he plans to continue his study of iconic 20th century writers who deal in fictional terms with major moral castrophes. He is currently researching Nobel laureate Gunter Grass and the prominent German writer's preoccupation with personal and national guilt that arose out of Nazism and the Holocaust.</p><p>A founding fellow of College Five, now Porter College, Robinson joined UCSC's Literature Department faculty in 1970. He earned his Ph.D in English Literature from Harvard in 1967 and his B.A. from Northwestern University in 1963. Robinson is also the editor of The Cambridge Companion to Mark Twain and coeditor with Susan Gillman of Mark Twain's Pudd'nhead Wilson: Race, Conflict, and Culture.  </p><p>   </p><p>					#####</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91543fc48072704601a012ffbd3850c7"><name>1780</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus Holiday Food Drive</title><start-date>1196319600000</start-date><display-name>Campus Holiday Food Drive...</display-name><path>/2007/11/1780</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2007/11/1780</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338471827</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338471827</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As we begin the busy holiday season, I write to remind you that the annual Second Harvest Food Bank UCSC Holiday Food Drive is in need of donations. </p><p>You can leave bags of nonperishable food items at your Mail Stop or send your check anytime to Holiday Food Drive, UCSC.

The announcement by Donna Murphy, vice chancellor for University Relations, follows a national search to fill the position. Shiller will begin his new job at UCSC on January 2, 2008.</p>
<p>"Barry's breadth of experience will be invaluable in communicating the many ways in which UCSC serves students, the greater Santa Cruz community, and the state and nation," Murphy said. "Barry has led communications teams in higher education as well as in the private sector, and he has an outstanding record of accomplishment in the dynamic field of communications."</p>
<p>Shiller, who currently is director of communications at Saint Mary's College of California, is excited about the opportunity to serve the campus. "UC Santa Cruz combines outstanding research capabilities, a distinctive undergraduate experience, and an impressive record of service to the local community and this region of California. I was captivated by the opportunity to be a part of that," he said. "In my encounters with people at UCSC, I was struck by their sense of commitment to the university and their enthusiasm about its future. I look forward to working with colleagues who are so engaged and dedicated."</p>
<p>At UCSC, Shiller will oversee the campus's internal and external communications, including media relations, marketing and publications, and new media and web development. Serving as a member of the campus's senior leadership team, Shiller will oversee campus programs that promote a broad understanding of and appreciation for the education, research, and public service activities of UCSC.</p>
<p>"My career experiences have led me to appreciate how important it is for institutions to be authentic in their communications. That mindset will guide how we collectively deal with the challenges and opportunities at UC Santa Cruz," Shiller said.</p>
<p>In filling the position of associate vice chancellor, Shiller replaces Elizabeth Irwin who retired this past January. Jim Burns, director of UCSC's Public Information Office, has served as acting AVC since Irwin's departure.</p>
<p>Shiller's expertise includes marketing, media relations, web and print publishing, government and community relations and institutional communication. His experience includes five years in higher-education administration and 15 years in private-sector public affairs, communications, and marketing.</p>
<p>At Saint Mary's College, Shiller was instrumental in helping address numerous challenges, including concerns about campus safety, the discontinuation of intercollegiate football, failed pledges, and various issues around its last presidential transition. While dealing with those challenges, Shiller assembled a talented College Communications Office staff and identified opportunities to better support the college's evolving communications and marketing needs. He oversaw the revamping of the college's quarterly magazine, introduced a weekly campus bulletin and monthly alumni e-newsletter, earned extensive positive media coverage, managed the renewal of the college's web site, and developed stronger relationships with local, state, and federal public officials and community organizations.</p>
<p>Before joining Saint Mary's in late 2002 Shiller held positions as vice president of Fineman Public Relations, vice president of marketing at J.D. Power Clubs/Carclub.com, and director of corporate communications for the California State Automobile Association (AAA of Northern California).</p>
<p>A native of San Francisco, Shiller earned his B.A. in psychology from the University of San Francisco and has spent most of his life in the Bay Area. He and his wife, Jane, have three children.</p>
